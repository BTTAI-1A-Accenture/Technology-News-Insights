The Fire Nation is here and ready to change everything.  Netflix released five new images showcasing the cast of their live action adaptation of the 2005 animated series "Avatar: The Last Airbender." After showing stills of the four lead characters in June, the streamer now gave first looks of four of the show’s villains and a second photo of Zuko, played by Dallas Liu.  Among the cast photos is “Lost” star Daniel Dae Kim who plays the show’s main antagonist Fire Lord Ozai, originally voiced by Mark Hamill.  “Kim's Convenience” star Sun-Hyung Lee will take on the role of fan favorite Uncle Iroh while "Rush Hour" actor Ken Leung will play Commander Zhao. Elizabeth Yu will play Zuko’s younger sister Princess Azula, who in the animated series doesn’t become a lead character until the second season.  Need a break?

The showrunners of the original series, Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko departed from their involvement in the Netflix remake due to creative disputes. The two have since worked on an animated movie through their studio and have a film slated for release in 2025.  No official trailer or teasers for the Netflix project have been released.  Below are the new photos of the characters fans can see when the series premieres in February:
