Galgalo added that each beneficiary will be receiving Sh8,000 in their contracted banks in parts of Machakos. "The older persons, orphans, vulnerable children and persons with severe disability will be receiving their stipend at six contracted banks such as Cooperative Bank, Equity, KCB, KWFT, National Bank and Post Bank," said Galgalo.
