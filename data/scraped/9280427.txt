Deadmau5 PARTY: DEADMAU5 10 p.m., Zouk Nightclub, zoukgrouplv.com. ARTS: THEODORE TSO: CAPTAIN PAIUTE Native American representation in comic books has often been limited to the roles of sidekick and exoticized mystic. But artist Theodore Tso puts the Indigenous Captain Paiute front and center as superhero. An enrolled member of the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe with ties to the Navajo, Tso spotlights Native traditions and tribal issues in his comics, his protagonist coming to the rescue in crises of land stewardship and cultural preservation. “Captain Paiute is a steward of Mother Earth, a cultural and environmental protector. He is the Defender of the Southwest,” reads an artist’s statement for Nevada Arts Council. Tso’s storyboards have previously been featured at Nevada State Museum, during a 2021 exhibit. See what his superhero been up to since.

Soak in the late ’90s and early aughts with performances by pop and rock acts Smash Mouth, O-Town, The Calling and LFO, with NSYNC’s Chris Kirkpatrick serving as master of ceremonies. Summer is for nostalgia, and the Palms pool will be the place to be.

MISC: ATTACK THE BLOCK The Beverly Theater’s Monster Mondays series concludes with predatory extraterrestrial beasts with mouths too full of glowing, razor-sharp teeth. Joe Cornish’s 2011 horror-comedy film, Attack the Block, pits these fearsome adversaries against a London street gang, and you only need take one look at the leader of that crew—the tough, but principled Moses, played in a star-making turn by Star Wars: The Force Awakens/They Cloned Tyrone’s John Boyega—to realize early on that the aliens are probably overmatched. Doctor Who’s Jodie Whittaker and Shaun of the Dead’s Nick Frost also star in this underseen gem, which boasts a gritty but stylized look, a smart, incisive script and an killer electronic soundtrack by British house duo Basement Jaxx. The Bev was practically made for this kind of big bang. 7:30 p.m., $10, the Beverly Theater, thebeverlytheater.com. –Geoff Carter Enjoy MUSIC: ENJOY With Dumb F*cks, Bad Vacation, 7 p.m., 24 Oxford, etix.com.
