                 IPOH: Telecommunication towers will be set up at 32 locations to serve Orang Asli villages in Perak, says state executive council member Mohd Azlan Helmi Helmi. During his winding-up speech at the state assembly sitting, the communications, multimedia, and non-governmental organisation committee chairman said this was in line with the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)’s National Digital Network (Jendela) initiative to provide better telecommunications services to all. “There is also a short-term solution under Jendela where 73 selected locations in Orang Asli villages will receive free Internet connection until the completion of the permanent towers," he said here on Wednesday (Dec 28). “Under Jendela, Perak will receive the most new telecommunications structures, which is 105. "We are now waiting for the final approval before the construction can start,” he said, adding that upgrades had been proposed for 27 existing towers servicing Orang Asli villages. “Seventeen of them have been upgraded,” he said. Mohd Azlan said in line with the state’s goal to have faster wireless Internet connection across the state, some schools and industrial areas have been selected to be hubs for fibre-optic connectivity. “The Federal Government, through the Communications and Ministry, has an initiative called 'point of presence' that will provide fibre-optic connectivity in rural areas. "Three industrial areas and 55 schools have been selected for this project which will be carried out by VC Telecoms Sdn Bhd. “We expect the project to start in January after it gets approval from the relevant agencies and local governments," he added.
