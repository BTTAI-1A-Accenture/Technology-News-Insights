To encourage gamers to show their creativity, Palit introduces the Maker feature for users to add their own designs on the GeForce RTX 40 GamingPro cooler cover and embrace their inventive identity. Palit enables users to add their 3D-printed design on the cooler cover. Users can download the 3D files Palit provided on the website, and 3D print the cover to paint or create add-on elements on it. Simply removed the 4 screws on the front cooler, users can install the customized 3D-printed design on the GamingPro, and create the one and only graphics card that belongs to themselves. Palit provides two versions of 3D files. For 3D editing pros, the “Creator Version” offers a plain cover without any pre-design on it. Users can take it as basement to design their own cover and show their creativity. For general users, the "Painting Version" comes with pre-designed patterns. Users can print the files through 3D printing house, and paint the cover that fits their own style.
