     CyberGuy shows how to make your phone impossible to snoop with a privacy screen. It can happen when you are in line at the bank, riding on a plane from the row behind, getting coffee, or hanging out waiting for a friend when a modern-day snoop strikes. Sometimes an innocent invasion takes a swipe at your privacy when someone else turns a glance at your phone screen into an info-gathering stare. CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER One of the latest scams hitting mobile devices starts with snooping crooks watching to see how you enter your passcode to unlock your phone. Whether you've been targeted by criminals or the innocently inquisitive, people are naturally curious and may be inclined to glance over and see what you are doing. With so much personal information on our phones, it’s more important than ever to guard against someone getting any of your life’s private details. Good news. There's an easy way to fix this issue with an inexpensive privacy screen protector for your screen to make it vastly more difficult for others to see what is on your phone or tablet.  ZOOM’S REVERSAL AFTER BACKLASH OVER AI FIASCO Sometimes, people look to snoop around and take a look at what you are doing on your phone, which is an invasion of privacy. ( ) Privacy screen protectors work as dark shields that you can use on your phones and tablets to keep other people from seeing what is on your screen. To fully see what is on a smart device with a screen protector, you have to be holding it directly in front of you, making those looking at it from an angle completely blind to the screen. These privacy screens do not protect your smart device screen from cracking or breaking, although they certainly protect your privacy and are a great asset, especially if you are someone who is often surrounded by people, like on public transit or in a work situation.
