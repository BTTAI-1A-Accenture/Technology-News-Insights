 Klea Pineda just came out as gay.  In Nelson Canlas's report on "24 Oras Weekend," Sunday, the "AraBella" star opened up on how she felt the need to tell the world who she really is.  "I'm proud na sabihin sa lahat ng mga Kapuso natin na I'm gay. I have a rainbow heart," she said.  Klea became emotional as she recalled how she almost backed out of coming out in fear of her life and her career getting affected by it.  "'Yung takot, nandidiyan siya parati pero mas nangingibabaw 'yung excitement. For the longest time nag-be-base ako sa mga tao kung sino talaga ako," she said.  "Ito 'yung masasabi ko na sa akin, na ako 'to, and I'm proud na ito ako," she added.  As for her showbiz work, Klea said she has no problems pairing up with men.  "Kaya ko pa naman makipag-kissing scene sa lalaki, hindi ko nililimit 'yung sarili ko when it comes to my work," she said.  Klea, who is also celebrating her 24th birthday, also shared a coming out post on her Instagram account.  "My 24th birthday is extra special since I finally mustered up the courage to come out to the world as my true authentic self," she said.  "I want the world to know that I am a proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community."  The Sparkle actress said she knows not everyone will understand her decision to come out, but she hopes to inspire others who are still coming into terms with their sexuality.  "Alam ko mahirap at nakakatakot, but please know na walang mali sa atin at walang kulang sa atin kahit pa magpakatotoo tayo. Marami man ang manghusga, mas marami pa rin ang tatanggap at magmamahal sa’yo nang buong-buo," she said.  Klea also assured her fans that she is still the same Klea and her sexuality won't stop her from chasing after her dreams.  "From now on, I want to live my life fearlessly. Sana samahan nyo ako sa paggawa ng sarili kong kwento na alam kong tunay na magpapasaya sa akin."  A post shared by Klea Pineda (@kleapineda)  —Kimberly Tsao/MGP, GMA Integrated News
