20th Aug, 2024 BUDDING film makers found out about life behind the scenes of the silver screen. Solihull Sixth Form College students took part in the workshops and listened to a presentation from two members of staff from the BIMM Screen and Film School, David and Raveena. The workshops saw the learners role-playing, as they explored how the production process of creating media works, including how narratives develop and the roles of a director, producer, director of photography and other production roles. The event lasted all day and concluded with a presentation, which focused on the courses on offer at the BIMM Screen and Film School and the pathways that these courses can lead to in the future. Media and IT curriculum leader Rasbinder Gill said: “We are grateful to David and Raveena from the BIMM Screen and Film School for giving up their time to visit us. “Our students really benefited from their expertise and the role-playing gave them a great opportunity to see what it is like to work in the media and film-making industry.” Check out all of the latest reader travel offers to get your hands on some free gifts.
