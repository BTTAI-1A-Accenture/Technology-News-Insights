 New hires can electronically complete I-9 forms, W-4s, and other paperwork through Paycor, which ensures compliance with state and federal regulations. The quick hire and bulk new hire features allow you to hire employees before completing the onboarding process and onboard multiple employees simultaneously. Additionally, Paycor offers an early employee engagement tool to connect with new hires and share handbooks, information, and policies before their first day. There’s also a tax credit integration feature that informs you of potential tax credits when you hire. Paycor offers a robust onboarding tool with standout features such as industry-specific onboarding tools, trackable training programs and early engagement tools. Here’s what you can expect from these features. Paycor offers employee onboarding tools for specific hiring conditions common in different industries. For example, its manufacturing onboarding process offers tools to onboard seasonal employees and manage their positions, employment status, immunizations and time policies regarding when they’re paid and when they’re not being paid. Other onboarding tools are provided for healthcare, restaurant and professional service companies. Jeff Garrand, Senior VP of Payroll and HRIS Technology Services at OperationsInc, also shared his thoughts on Paycor’s onboarding dashboard: “Paycor has a user-friendly onboarding tracking dashboard and a step-by-step process to get employees setup appropriately. Users can also designate the appropriate access group and registration email within the same onboarding area. Users can also utilize their recruiting module to expand on the onboarding module for other requirements such as background checks.” Paycor offers you employee development tools to help your new hires be set up for success in their roles. Training programs are self-paced and, hiring managers receive progress reports, training feedback and automated alerts for milestones completed within the training courses. In my testing, I was offered three ways to set up learning modules for new hires. I could choose from standard new hire courses from Paycor, such as those pertaining to OSHA, sexual harassment or cyber security best practices and policies. Or, I could upload my own pre-designed course. Lastly, I could create a course within the platform using provided tools, such as the ability to record a video, link to another website, provide a website link, host a discussion forum or add a live teaching session. Paycor’s early-engage tools help you engage new hires before their first day of work so they are set up for success from day one. In my testing, I found that new hires can fill out onboarding documents from their mobile devices and input their own contact and direct deposit information. And, employers can provide new hires with company information, handbooks and company policies within the app. I also found that the software offers pre-built and custom task lists. Managers can create or select tasks, and then assign them due dates and assignees. If assigned to an employee, for example, the employee would receive a notification within the software or a text or email notification of the task’s existence and due date. From there, managers can track each task’s status as outstanding, complete or overdue. A progress bar also shows the percentage of the onboarding process that is completed by all relevant parties. Who should use it:  Because Paycor offers specialized onboarding tools for these businesses, those in the manufacturing, restaurant, healthcare or professional services industries should strongly consider Paycor.

 Through Workday Talent Acquisition, you’ll have everything you need to recruit and onboard employees seamlessly. Your internal and external candidates can use the platform to search for fitting open roles, apply for a job (or multiple jobs), manage their applications, schedule interviews, accept an offer and complete the onboarding process. On the hiring manager’s end, you’ll be able to understand the skills gaps you need to fill, surface the most appropriate candidates to fill them, check their backgrounds, engage with them through the interview process, design a first-day orientation and set onboarding task reminders from one place. Workday’s Recruiting tool allows you to recruit based on skills gaps within your company. As candidates apply for your jobs, it suggests skills that may be applicable to them and to open roles. I found hiring reports to be intuitive-to-interpret graphs and pie charts that are color-coded to show the data managers need to make decisions, such as where top performers are often sourced, the number of candidates in different stages of the hiring journey and internal and external fill percentages. Also, spreadsheet databases and complete candidate profiles allow you to easily access candidate information and update it so all hiring personnel are on the same page regarding each candidate. The Workday Jobs Hub allows internal employees to find advancement opportunities that may interest them. It gives them a centralized hub to apply for open jobs, refer potential candidates and manage their job applications. Workday Skills Cloud unifies several tools Workday offers for recruiting, placing and developing needed skills within your organization. In addition to offering Workday Recruiting and Workday Jobs Hub under its umbrella, it also offers Workday Talent Optimization, which suggests roles for internal employees based on their skills, Workday Learning, which helps employees develop new skills your organization needs and Workday Prism Analytics, which gives you internal and third-party analytics to identify skills gaps in your organization. We can’t forget new employee journeys, which allow you to use a drag-and-drop builder to create plans based on location, hire date, department and other unique attributes. You can deliver the journeys for onboarding, performance management, leaves of absence and more. In the demo, I found this process to be as intuitive as filling out a simple form. For example, using one form, I could add contacts the new hire should meet, videos and messages from managers, tasks they should complete and learning opportunities they can take advantage of. All of this can be catered to the individual and their new role and is accessible within any device the employee is most comfortable using. Who should use it:  If you’re looking for a robust solution that allows you to analyze talent gaps within your company, recruit to fill those talent gaps and onboard candidates all in one place, Workday should be on your radar.

 Bamboo HR offers all the tools you need to create a custom and responsive hiring and onboarding experience for all candidates. It offers customizable hiring packages that allow you to introduce your new hire to their new roles and departments based on their job types and locations. E-signatures, customizable email templates and a mobile app ensure you can keep the onboarding process moving through seamless onboarding journeys. Then, onboarding task checklists help make sure your employees start off productively and with the right connections. Thanks to BambooHR’s onboarding templates, you can customize the onboarding process for various positions, departments and locations. For example, when testing the product, I found that an offer letter can be generated from the candidate’s BambooHR profile with just one click. Then, I only had to fill out a short form with details like the candidate’s start date, job title, compensation and pay frequency. From there, I could send the custom offer letter from the BambooHR platform with one click. Bamboo’s hiring and onboarding mobile app is available to hiring managers on Android and iOS devices. Its functions include the ability to review resumes, a chat-based interface to communicate and the ability to schedule interviews. BambooHR’s e-signature tool allows you to automate e-signature requests. You can also store all standard new hire paperwork in your documents tab within your BambooHR “files” tab. In testing, I observed that the system also keeps a running file of standard signature templates, such as templates for background check authorizations and 1-9 and W-4 forms. I only had to click on the form to send it to a new hire. To do so, I could either email it to them or share it with the new hire within BambooHR. Or, I could click “request signature” and either send it to an individual, a group or all employees. Tiffani Martinez, HR Director for Otter HR, shared a few of the features she likes about Bamboo: “Bamboo HR gives you everything you need in HR software and a very easy and user-friendly onboarding experience. Bamboo can send documents to be e-signed on your first day, and it keeps it all on file for you in the system. Bamboo HR checks all my boxes for a small business, especially for your onboarding.” Who should use it: If a customized onboarding experience is of utmost importance, BambooHR can help you deliver it.

 Rippling is designed to accommodate a global workforce in up to 50 countries. It dynamically adjusts hiring and onboarding flows according to the employee’s location. From the time a new employee or contractor signs their Rippling-generated offer letter or service-level agreement, Rippling propels them forward in an automated workflow that’s customized to your company’s onboarding procedures. Nick Valentino, the VP of Market Operations of Bellhop, shared his thoughts on the software: “I’ve been impressed with Rippling. For starters, their transparent pricing is a huge plus. I also love that it includes not only payroll and benefits, but also IT onboarding and training modules. It really has all of the services we need, especially as a largely remote company.” Rippling allows you to put in a few details about your employee, then let the system update details and perform actions for their onboarding across departments. For example, if you hire an employee in the system, it would add them to payroll; send them a welcome email, company Wi-Fi information, parking regulations, brand guidelines, organizational charts, access logins and training resources; order and ship them a company computer and walk them through enrolling in benefits, all without the company having to lift a finger. Onboarding can happen in 90 seconds because of Rippling Unity—a platform that combines Rippling’s IT, Finance and HR cloud. It ties together data about each employee across all platforms and allows a ripple effect of automations once a change is made in any platform. In my testing, I learned that an “employee graph” captures each employee’s role, location/country, tenure and reporting data and relies on all information to make accurate decisions about, for example, what work expenses they’re allowed (Finance cloud) and what computer they need to complete their jobs (IT cloud).  Then, once an employee has been defined in the system, the system automated all onboarding with minimal interaction on my part. You can further customize workflows using Rippling’s pre-built workflow templates. You can install one with just a couple of clicks, then either use them as they are or customize them to your needs. These automation templates can be applied to streamline the employee onboarding process. Example workflow templates for the onboarding process include Rippling’s new hire onboarding survey, welcome, referral bonus and benefits enrollment deadline reminder templates. Who should use it:  Companies looking to hire around the globe at scale will benefit from Rippling’s automated, localized onboarding software. Learn more: Read our full Rippling review.

 According to Zenefits, now owned by Trinet, its customers can complete new hire onboarding in less than 10 minutes. You can use the software to design compensation packages, request background checks, send offer letters and much more. Once a candidate accepts your offer, they can use Trinet Zenefits to onboard on their own via a computer or their mobile device before their first day. The app will automate everything and even add new hires to payroll. Plus, it integrates with all types of software you might already be using, such as Slack, Salesforce and Microsoft 365. Conor Hughes, SHRM-SCP, a human resources consultant at RealHR Solutions, shared his thoughts on Zenefits: “From my experience overhauling the onboarding processes of various small businesses, I would recommend Zenefits to most as an end-to-end solution. The setup is faster and it provides seamless integration with payroll and benefits.” Trinet Zenefits offers a robust mobile app so hiring managers can onboard new hires from their mobile devices by: Trinet Zenefits allows HR personnel to streamline onboarding by integrating the company’s necessary digital tools. For example, they can integrate their benefits, payroll, scheduling, benefits administration and time and scheduling tools to ensure new hire information is synced throughout their entire onboarding tech stack and automate account provisioning to all of them for self-onboarding purposes. During testing, I found that setting up employees with integrations is as simple as clicking the preferred integrations when onboarding a new team member. This process looks like a step-by-step wizard that has you fill out a series of forms to input information about the new hire, send them necessary onboarding documents and tell the system what onboarding tasks you’d like it to complete during its onboarding process, such as sending certain onboarding documents and performing a background check on the new hire. Trinet Zenefits offers a platform to store and auto-generate all necessary documents for standard onboarding processes. You can, for example, generate tax documents, payroll documents, offer letters and confidentiality agreements; send them to employees to complete or view; and file, categorize and update them—all from one central location. You can even create custom privacy policies, company handbooks and non-compete clauses as needed and collaborate across devices to do so. Who should use it: Zenefits can be a good option if you’d like to expedite the onboarding process and ensure new hires can complete it easily while on the go.

 Managers and HR teams have visibility and control over the entire onboarding process in UKG Pro.

UKG Pro gives you tools to create a personalized experience through interactive and dynamic content. You can add videos about the company and personalize welcome messages with confidence-boosting reminders of why they were hired. You can also offer personalized checklists for tasks to complete before their first day. Jeff Garrand, Senior VP of Payroll and HRIS Technology Services at OperationsInc, also likes UKG’s onboarding experience and customization options: “Onboarding is easy and intuitive to utilize with workflows for managers and new hires that flow directly from the Recruiting module and the candidate process. Even when experiencing hiccups, and someone needing to be manually added, the process was easy and onboarding could be enabled mid process. Emails for the new hire and manager were customized for content and timing. Required documents, based on position/state/entity could also be customized into different onboarding profiles so the new hire only received the reminders and documents that were pertinent to them.” UKG Pro offers a new hire dashboard that provides new employees with all the tools they need to jump into their roles efficiently. The dashboard displays all the tasks the new hire needs to complete to onboard into the company and is accessible from any mobile or desktop device. It also allows employees to: In my testing experience, the dashboard had a clean design and easily accessible features. A detailed menu on the left-hand side offered all the features I would need to navigate onboarding. Clear call-to-action buttons walked me through how to use each tool, such as updating my personal information with just a couple of clicks and by filling out simple forms. On the hiring manager’s end, the dashboard offers tools to he dashboard offers tools to help managers guide new hires to success: Who should use it: UKG Pro is ideal for companies hiring remotely that want to drum up employee engagement and belonging before a new employee’s first day and through their first few weeks of employment.

 ADP Workforce Now makes it easy for new hires to complete all of their onboarding paperwork before their first day. As an employer, you can create a welcome message, company video, checklists and neighborhood map with points of interest. ADP Workforce Now’s standout onboarding features include its custom or pre-packaged new-hire training courses as well as its personalized onboarding dashboard. Once your new hire starts, you can help them more easily transition into their role with customized training. To aid you in doing so, ADP Workforce Now offers the ability to assign courses to employees and track their progress or completion. The software’s catalog offers thousands of courses on subjects such as: You can also create custom courses that employees can easily enroll themselves. Tiffani Martinez, HR Director at Otter PR, shared her thoughts on ADP Workforce Now: “ADP is a great choice because you are taking a payroll system and getting the HR support needed to accompany every aspect. In my opinion, ADP Workforce Now’s major perk is that once the information is entered on onboarding, it goes to everything. They e-verify you, add your information for taxes and payroll and provide HR support for important compliance issues such as EEOC, FMLA and ADA. This is a win for a newer company that does not have the proper HR support.” Even before a new hire’s first day of employment, they can access a personalized onboarding dashboard where they can meet their hiring manager, assigned onboarding buddy and soon-to-be work team. It also includes a map of the company and its surrounding area so the employee can more quickly acclimate to their new work location. Finally, they can check off onboarding tasks such as: Who should use it:  ​​ADP Workforce Now should be on your radar if you like the idea of a seamless, automated new hire onboarding and training experience.

 With Namely, you can capture all of the new hire data you need with ease. The software offers configurable templates to help you collect emergency contacts, state-required documentation, T-shirt sizes, favorite coffee and just about any other data. You also have the opportunity to create a personalized welcome message and new hire tasks. Namely HR provides a customized onboarding experience using new hire task lists and templates. Namely HR offers a robust task list tool that allows companies to alert responsible parties across departments to complete onboarding tasks. For example, its hiring manager task list might include scheduling the new hire’s first-week and goal-setting check-ins. Jeff Garrand, Senior VP of Payroll and HRIS Technology Services at OperationsInc, had issues with getting notifications: “Namely onboarding is mostly user friendly and intuitive to use. But there are no automated email notifications once someone has completed their portion of the onboarding which lends to dependency on manual follow up.” In my testing, I observed that the custom onboarding process is easy due to the software’s custom onboarding wizard. Once you’ve decided the onboarding checklist for each employee, they’re walked through completing the checklist in a step-by-step guided fashion. A separate wizard even helps them easily set up benefits enrollment. And, the software’s clean, social-media-like experience makes the process a familiar one for new hires. Namely HR offers a plethora of templates to help you streamline your custom onboarding process and complete related tasks. Templates are customizable in that you can add sections, choose the included questions and even choose options for multiple-choice questions or leave the question open-ended with a text box. You can also add drop-down fields and checkboxes, among other field types. In my testing, it was easy to create a new template. The software includes a template builder that allows you to add sections, field types and make your own questions. It’s as easy as filling out a simple form and clicking to include certain features and sections on any template. Who should use it:  If you tend to collect a lot of data from new hires and want to simplify the process, Namely can be a solid choice. Learn more: Read our full Namely review.

 Compared to other onboarding software, Freshservice (formerly Freshteam) offers more efficient ways to onboard new hires in bulk. This can be especially helpful for businesses that hire a lot of employees for peak seasons, for example Some standout onboarding features offered through Freshservice include its bulk onboarding feature and, service catalog. You can upload employee information in bulk, then automatically create task requests and send forms to respective employees and managers. The platform will then track the onboarding progress of each new hire, allowing you to stay on top of outstanding tasks and forms. Freshservice houses a service catalog of forms and items for new hires. For example, you can create an onboarding form requesting an ID card, laptop and a company email for each new employee. If your service catalog form becomes a standard request for certain roles, you can save them as templates for specific roles or departments, for example, and simply select it the next time you hire an employee in a similar position. In my testing, I found that setting up an onboarding kit involves setting up conditions that allow for automatic provisioning of the kit for certain new hires. For example, if I wanted to create a kit for a new IT specialist, I could choose the forms and items I’d like to include in the kit, then set the condition for “job role includes IT specialist.” From there, the system will provide the kit for employees who are hired with this term in their job descriptions. These kits can also be customized by department or location. While we like Freshservice for its bulk onboarding, Yuval Magid, Chief Operating Officer of Connecteam, likes it for different reasons: “I see Freshservice as a good fit for smaller teams with a focus on remote work and the built-in communication tools can be helpful for getting new hires acclimated. However, I wasn’t a huge fan of the user interface, which felt a little cluttered.” Who should use it:  Freshservice is worth considering if you are poised for growth and hire in bulk.

 Kallidus automatically assigns new employees to ready-made courses in Kallidus’ learning management system (LMS) based on factors such as their roles, departments and locations, keeping your company compliant and giving HR staff one less thing to worry about. Conor Hughes, SHRM-SCP, a human resources consultant at RealHR Solutions, finds Kallidus to be better suited for companies who already have an HRIS and want dedicated onboarding functionality layered on top. The focus is on creating an interactive onboarding portal new hires can access. [With Kallidus] you can add rich media, electronic forms, chatbots and more to engage them. For larger SMBs with more complex needs, it provides more customization and automation compared to Zenefits. The analytics dashboards also help track and improve the onboarding experience over time.”  While Kallidus is primarily an employee learning software, it offers standout employee training tools. Kallidus offers a robust learning platform you can use to train your new hires. It boasts a pre-built course catalog of over 250 courses that are constantly updated to comply with the latest legislations and regulations. Courses are constantly updated to comply with the latest legislations and regulations. Example courses I found in the testing process include: Courses are also customizable to employee needs. For example, Kallidus courses can be translated into over 100 languages instantly and are accessible on both mobile and desktop devices. They can also be accessed with closed captions, and video speeds can be customized to the learner’s needs. Learners can replay sessions as needed, and employees can take self-awareness assessments to understand their progress and repeat courses if necessary. In addition, Kallidus offers the ability to personalize courses by adding company logos, colors, graphics and text. Who should use it: Companies that need an extensive selection of advanced and automated onboarding learning and training tools should strongly consider Kallidus. See MoreSee Less See MoreSee Less 
 Onboarding software is a platform that allows you to streamline the new hire onboarding process from sending an offer letter to tax form submissions and setting up access to internally-used software. It often can take care of the time-consuming manual tasks of the onboarding process, improving compliance while saving you time and hassle. Your company most likely needs onboarding software if it hires often and at scale or if you have a one-person HR team who juggles many HR duties. Onboarding software ensures that new employees are going through each necessary step in your onboarding process. You should also use onboarding software if you care about the employee experience, as onboarding software tools help orient the new employee in their first days on the job. Your HR person or team could onboard new employees themselves without onboarding software. However, this takes time away from other more value-added activities and increases the chances of confusion and missing steps in the onboarding process. The HR person must remember what the new hire needs to do, send them the right documents, receive them through email or some other decentralized means of communication and manually remind new employees to complete tasks. When choosing the best onboarding software, taking factors such as cost, flexibility and customization into account is a given. Your software of choice should make it easy to follow onboarding best practices every time you hire a new employee. Let’s consider some specific details that you should weigh in when making a purchasing decision. Ask the Expert Lisa Lindsey Forbes Business Advisory Board Member Alana Rudder Staff Reviewer Rachel Williams Small Business Editor Onboarding software, like any other software, should be secure, compliant and robust, with the ultimate goal of reducing the manual effort of onboarding. Remember however, that the ultimate goal of onboarding is to introduce new hires to your culture, create connection and set them up for long-term success, so don’t forget the importance of the human touch! Forbes Business Advisory Board Member Onboarding software should offer automations that complete tasks such as sending necessary documents to your new hire, enrolling them in required new hire training programs and assigning manual onboarding tasks to team members. This inclusion can help your company save time and money, while creating a competitive employee experience. Staff Reviewer A user-friendly interface should be one of the top things to look for in onboarding software. If it’s not easy for you to use—or your new hires—it can cause frustration and may impact adoption of the software by your company. You want the best experience for your new hires, so take advantage of trials and demos to ensure features are easy to find and use. Small Business Editor Onboarding software should plug a new employee’s data into the tech stack by connecting with payroll, benefits administration, communication tools, such as Slack and other apps they’ll need to perform their job. A bonus for HR employees is the ability to move newly hired candidates from the applicant tracking system or recruiting software into the onboarding flow. For systems that aren’t as intuitive and require some time to get used to, the onboarding software provider should provide training or ample resources to support customers and their employees in implementation and everyday use. Check out user reviews for the provider to see how responsive and effective their customer service is. Featured Partners 1 Justworks Yes Yes $50/month + $8/user 1 Justworks On Justworks' Website 2 SurePayroll Yes Yes $29.99/mo plus $5 per employee 2 SurePayroll On SurePayroll's Website 3 OnPay Yes Yes $40 per month + $6 per user 3 OnPay On OnPay's Website 4 Rippling Yes Yes $35 per month + $8 per user 4 Rippling On Rippling's Website 5 Gusto Yes Yes $40 per month plus $6 per user 5 Gusto On Gusto's Website The cost of onboarding software varies greatly, from free basic editions to complex plans costing hundreds of dollars per month. Pricing generally depends on the number of employees you have and the majority of providers offer pricing on a custom basis, so pricing isn’t widely available. Onboarding software is rarely a stand-alone tool and is usually bundled into a broader platform or offered as an add-on. Check the monthly or annual subscription fees as well as any one-time expenses you’ll have to cover. The solution should fit comfortably within your budget. To determine the best onboarding software for small businesses, Forbes Advisor researched the industry and analyzed 25 different companies and plans. We then scored these contenders across five different categories covering 35 separate metrics that were weighted to favor features that small business owners find valuable in a provider. Based on those factors, each onboarding software solution earned a star rating of up to five stars. Here are the categories we used to rank the providers that made the top of the list. Quality onboarding software includes automated workflows, background checks and employment compliance. It also offers progress reporting so that you and your new hires know where you stand with the process. Paycor, Zenefits, BambooHR and several other vendors in the market offer free trials of their onboarding software but do not provide free-forever onboarding software. TalentHR offers free-forever onboarding software for up to 25 users. Onboarding is important because it makes a lasting impression on new employees and makes a difference in their confidence and excitement for their new role. Onboarding ensures that a new employee gets acquainted with the company policy and culture, set up with the basic conditions of employment, such as payroll and benefits, and also has all the tools necessary to flourish in their new job. The onboarding process can be a deciding factor in employee engagement, retention and time to productivity. Here are the best practices for onboarding remote employees: • Get started early, through a preboarding process, to work out any glitches • Send a welcome email or message • Deliver tech tools to their home, such as a laptop • Provide them with access to apps and tools for the job, such as email and social collaboration tools • Encourage them to start experimenting with the technical tools they’ll use on the job • Send them the employee handbook for review at any time • Pair them with an onboarding buddy who’s been with the company for at least three months and is aware of how and how often to engage with the new employee • Invite them to join employee interest groups or particular channels of communication in the company’s internal communication tool You can improve your onboarding process with these tips: • Send a welcome email or message with a schedule of what to expect on the first day or in the first week • Provide tools and access before day one • Provide a checklist with due dates • Send or schedule task reminders • Send over necessary documents for signing before day one • Opt for software with e-signature to ease document management • Send a welcome package with company swag to drum up excitement • Match them with an onboarding buddy • Gather feedback from the new employee and onboarding buddy (if applicable) • Set up frequent, routine check-ins with manager or team to discuss expectations, processes and company culture • Give frequent feedback • Prolong the onboarding process to support the new employee in their first year with the company to boost retention • Don’t forget employees who need support when transitioning to new roles within the organization Onboarding can take anywhere from two weeks to a year. Within the first few weeks, a new employee takes care of the administrative tasks of onboarding, such as getting set up with payroll and benefits. However, onboarding can continue long after a new employee achieves full productivity. This can take the form of relationship-building events for new-hire cohorts or check-ins with their manager, a team member, an onboarding buddy or someone in HR. The longer the onboarding process takes, the more supported a new employee will feel in their role and greater the chances that the company will retain them long term, so don’t view onboarding as mutually exclusive from job performance and productivity. By contrast, long-term onboarding can help with job performance and productivity.
