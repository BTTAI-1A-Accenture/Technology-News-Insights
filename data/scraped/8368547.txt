AMSTERDAM - US apparel company Gap has become the 65th brand to sign up to the Pakistan Accord garment factory safety programme launched late last year by the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry. Gap, which sources from 14 factories in Pakistan, joins the likes of H&M, Inditex, Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, and PVH in backing the programme which now covers more than 450 textile and garment factories and nearly a million workers. “We are encouraged by Gap Inc’s commitment to ensuring worker safety in their supply chain and look forward to working with them and their local partners for a safer Pakistani apparel manufacturing industry,” said a spokesperson for the International Accord.
