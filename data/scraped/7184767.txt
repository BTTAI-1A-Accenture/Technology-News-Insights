Social media giant %Twitter has added %Cryptocurrency and stock prices to its search results. The new feature allows users of Twitter to type a cryptocurrency or stock name or ticker symbol into the search bar and receive the current price along with a pricing chart. The crypto and stock price feature appears to be a partnership with %Robinhood ($HOOD) as the search results also bring up a link to the Robinhood trading app. Privately held Twitter has moved further into the cryptocurrency industry over the last few years, adding a tipping feature for %Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in September 2021. New Twitter owner Elon Musk has vowed to add new features to the social media platform and has himself been a supporter of crypto. Musk famously added $1.5 billion U.S. worth of Bitcoin to the balance sheet of electric vehicle maker %Tesla ($TSLA), which he also runs. However, most of that Bitcoin has now been sold. In a tweet promoting the new crypto and stock pricing, Twitter stated: “In the coming weeks, we'll refine the user experience and expand our coverage of (ticker) symbols.” Musk purchased Twitter at the end of October this year for $44 billion U.S. and took the company private.
