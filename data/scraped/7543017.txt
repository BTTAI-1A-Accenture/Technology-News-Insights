Following its BlackEyePatch collaboration, standout Japanese label AFB has now teamed up with FOSTEX GARMENTS for a capsule collection. Exploring the military garment specialist’s signature offerings, AFB has put together a series of MA-1 bomber jackets and cargo pant styles. Leading the AFB x FOSTEX GARMENTS capsule collection is the PEACE MA-1, a classic bomber jacket design offered in textile “Camo” or nylon “Khaki.” The jacket features classic AFB star embroidery, military badges, and a peace logo motif at the rear. Classic detailing comes in the form of a bright orange interior lining for reversible wear, thick banding, zipper closure, functional left arm pocket, and button flap pockets. Another option is the HOODED MA-1 which is outfitted with a matching hood and a “Black” nylon body marked with tonal AFB star embroidery at the rear. Finishing up the collaboration are the ZIP CARGO PANTS defined by adjustable ties at the belt loop waist, AFB star embroidery, side pockets, and zippers at the ankles.
Priced between ¥26,400 and ¥60,500 JPY (approximately $195 and $445 USD), the AFB x FOSTEX GARMENTS capsule collection is available now exclusively on AFB’s website.
