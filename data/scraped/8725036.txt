  | SANCTUM OF HARMONY | Category – Institutional/ Spiritual Client – Dr. Harikumar Architecture Firm – Archidobe  Principal Architect - Ar. Prajith.K.Pradeep  & Ar. Gopika Krishnakumar Area – 400 (sq.ft) Year of Completion - 2019 Location - Pathiripala, Palakkad, Kerala Photographer - Hawin Printo C  Budget – Rs. 4,00,000/- Project Contractor - Ar. Prajith.K.Pradeep & Pradeep K.U.  Sanctum of Harmony invokes the very presence of earthly hues in the minds of its end user. Being rooted to its surroundings the structure opens a gateway to the realm of arts and architecture of an age where nature was worshipped as gods. The brief being unique, our motive was to create meaningful space that transcends nature through its material that is commonly used. The site is located in a small town of Palakkad, Kerala within the premises of the already established Sadanam Kathakali Academy. Our client, Dr. Harikumar, a professional Kathakali dancer and music teacher, has a deep connection with a particular banyan tree on site. Thus, under that large banyan tree, provided the cradle of our thought process on what the purpose and identity of the structure should be. The curves and ridges in the structure reveal the story of ornaments, costumes and figures used in the Kathakali art form. Knowing the richness and dynamism of a performing art from our client and incorporating the fruits of it in a static structure has fuelled the creative process.  Sanctum of Harmony is a project paid as a tribute to our ancestral practices of architecture and an initiative to promote pragmatic approach. In a social overview sanctum of harmony Altogether with its surrounding speaks for a time when spaces shall bring people, culture, and nature together.  #designkerala #archidobe #keralaarchitecture  #indianarchitecture  #architecture #architecturelovers #keralaattraction #keralagodsowncountry #indianarchitects #archdaily #architecturedesign #architecturaldigest #beautifulhomes #keralatemple #temple #templearchitecture #templesofindia #indiantemples #architecturelove #kerala #palakkad
