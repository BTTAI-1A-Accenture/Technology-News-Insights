 It’s an annual tradition for the last Saturday in June — except when it’s not. Butler Road Race returns to downtown on June 24 at 9 a.m. after on-course construction forced a date change in 2022. Butler Road Race 5-mile and 2k has bounced through many changes over its 48-year history. Originally a 10k which proudly billed itself as “the toughest 10k in Western Pa.,” the event evolved from a race of the fastest and strongest to a race which supported local high school runners with scholarships. In 2018, Butler YMCA spread the race’s impact throughout the greater community by funding services for youth, families and seniors. In the process, Butler Road Race has become a gentler, family and beginner-friendly run while continuing to attract speedy competition. At 48, Butler Road Race is the oldest consecutively run road race in the region. During the COVID-19 quarantine, the event held a virtual event over a ten-day period in June. Participants chose their own course and reported results online, keeping the event alive. Christina Dreher, race director and Development Director for Butler Family YMCA, is happy to return to the traditional June race date. Participation was lower last September due to competition from other events and Labor Day conflicts. “We’re hoping to get more high school runners back,” she says. “In September the cross country runners were busy with their racing season.” Last year, more than a quarter of the runners were YMCA members. Dreher says that members are very supportive and generous in giving back to the community. “The YMCA is more than a gym. It’s part of the community,” she said, thanking Butler Health System, now Independence Health, for its continued support over the years. There’s nothing new about this year’s Butler Road Race except that runners won’t have to pass through a construction site. The Sullivan Run Bridge Project has been completed for both 5-mile and 2k runners. There will be water stops at both turnaround points on the course, but Dreher encourages runners to carry water if it’s a particularly hot day. There will not be a formal awards ceremony following the race. Top three male and female finishers, masters and top three in age groups from 9-under through 70+ earn certificates. First male and female YMCA members earn special recognition, and the first Butler County male and female finishers earn the Donny Bayne Memorial Award, named for one of the original organizers, longtime BRR supporter and distance runner, the late Donald D. Bayne. Winners may pick up awards at the finish area or at the Butler YMCA or awards will be mailed later. There’s plenty of time to register for this year’s Butler Road Race, although you may not receive a commemorative T-shirt. You can register by mail or online at bcfymca.org/events/butler-road-race. There will be registration and packet pick up at the Butler YMCA lobby on Friday, June 23, 3 to 6 p.m. Day-of-event registration opens in Diamond Park at 7:30 a.m., cash or check only. Kids ages 12 and under may register at a discounted cost of $15. Butler Road Race is one event in the YMCA’s Annual Support Campaign which funds programs and services like the free Reach and Rise youth mentoring program. Other events include a golf scramble in September, Giving Tuesday in December, Bowl for Kids in March, Rally for the Y indoor bike challenge in April.
