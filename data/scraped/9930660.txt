The Esthetics Technology curriculum provides competency-based knowledge, scientific/artistic principles and hands-on fundamentals associated with the art of skin care. The curriculum provides a simulated salon environment which enables students to develop manipulative skills. Course work includes instruction in all phases of professional Esthetics Technology, business/human relations, product knowledge, and other related topics. Graduates should be prepared to take the North Carolina State Board of Cosmetic Arts Licensing Exam. Upon passing, they may be licensed and qualify for employment in beauty and cosmetic/skin care salons, as a platform artist or in related businesses. Â  Wake Tech academic programs (credit and non-credit) that are designed to lead to professional licenses are tied to North Carolina or national certifications. If you intend to pursue professional licenses outside North Carolina once you have completed your academic program at Wake Tech, please refer to the Professional Licensure section of the college's distance education authorization page for additional information.
