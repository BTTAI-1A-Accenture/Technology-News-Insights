For Faculty,              For Staff,              For Students,              Service Outages  We are experiencing an issue with Wi-Fi network connectivity at locations across the Middlebury College campus. We are working closely with our vendors to resolve matters as swiftly as possible. We will provide an update as soon as we know more. Symptoms of the problem include being able to connect to Wi-Fi, but then being unable to access the Internet, or simply being unable to connect to Wi-Fi. For those that have the option, a wired network connection will work. We apologize for this disruption. Thank you for your patience.
