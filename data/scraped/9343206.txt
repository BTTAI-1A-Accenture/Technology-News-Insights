                 The Taobao Maker Festival was first established in 2016 and was created to showcase, celebrate and support the novel innovations from young entrepreneurs on the platform. BEING the largest digital retail platform in China, Taobao is no stranger to Malaysian consumers who are on the lookout for cross-border goods. According to Analysys, Taobao had the highest gross merchandise value (GMV) among China’s digital retail platforms for the 12 months ending on March 31, 2022. With an engaging, personalised shopping experience optimised by data analytics and technology, Taobao has transformed itself into a one-stop consumer destination for discovery and shopping. Whether you’re looking for fashion items, electronics, sports apparel, home and living products or even raw materials for your niche interests, Taobao’s vast selection ensures that there is something for everyone on the platform. Taobao Maker Festival  While the platform has been making waves for its plethora of products, it has also been actively spotlighting youth and merchant creativity in the industry through the Taobao Maker Festival (TMF). First introduced in 2016, TMF was created to highlight novel products showcased by some of Taobao’s most creative and youthful merchants, to celebrate and support their innovations, as well as provide them with a platform to showcase their products to the new generation of consumers. With Taobao celebrating its 20-year anniversary, this year’s iteration of the festival was bigger and more open than ever, as the platform aims to spread the fun experience further and wider with its valued customers, by making the TMF open to the public for the first time. The 8th TMF themed “Uncovering Infinite Lifestyle Possibilities on Taobao”, which took place over the Labour Day weekend from April 29 to May 1, had the highest geographical reach in the event’s history, as it spanned across 10 cities in China. The public was granted free access to all exhibitions in the 10 cities, which were Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Chengdu, Xiamen, Wuhan, Nanjing and Changsha. TMF also featured three distinctive themed exhibitions in Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing, each highlighting a different aspect of the Taobao platform. A look at the themed exhibitions in Hangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing. “Wonder” in Hangzhou, brought together artisans, delicious food offerings and products related to anime, comics and games, while “Technology” in Shenzhen explored futuristic technologies in areas such as consumer electronics and intelligent manufacturing. “Trends” in Chongqing focused on mesmerising new trends in clothing, designer toys and home furnishings, which were also showcased onsite. Apart from the physical exhibitions, merchants also engaged with online consumers in real time via Taobao’s built-in livestream commerce channel Taobao Live – allowing them to participate in the exhibition and experience the products wherever they are. Concurrently, a series of immersive Taobao Maker fairs were held in the other seven cities, where attendees could experience the youthful, imaginative, and energetic lifestyles that are available from Taobao and its Maker Merchants. Consumption trends A large number of “Maker Stores” on Taobao gathered to showcase their products at the TMF exhibitions, with the main focus reflecting four rapidly growing consumption trends on Taobao: interest, pleasure, health and family. Many merchants on Taobao attract like-minded consumers by offering unique and niche products such as eco-friendly cold brew colour inks by Starry Ink for calligraphy enthusiasts, and even modern Hanfu garments designed using technology by local brand Zhizaosi. Other niche products like movable handmade wooden fish lanterns by Handmade Creation of Wang also engage customers with its unique blend of traditional craftsmanship with modern designs. Maker Merchant Kreator also accomplishes this through the uniqueness of the brand as its products incorporate a traditional wool felt knitting process, which has nearly 8,000 years of history. Torist Pet’s skateboards highlight the personalities of both pets and their owners. Products that facilitate a distinctive way of life are also popular as they bring happiness to everyone involved, such as 94oC’s candle art paintings that help people release stress. Torist Pet’s animal skateboards also achieve this as it highlights the personalities of both the pets and their trendy owners. Healthy living and eating are also on the rise, and with high-quality ingredients, matched with technology, eating healthy is now more convenient than ever. For example, technology has been used by Kaluga Queen – a pioneer of artificial sturgeon breeding – based in China’s Qiandao Lake, which is known for its quality water, to produce one of the best types of cultivated caviar that is used by Michelin-starred restaurants. Another example would be smart food manufacturing brand Moodles, which has established a 3D printing smart food factory, to create food that is both delicious and healthy. Merchants and shoppers are also rediscovering the beauty of family life, reflected in innovative entertainment products that cater to young consumers. Hover Camera X1 is the perfect companion to use when taking photos during family activities. Products displayed in the exhibitions such as the Hover Camera’s “flying camera” fit this description, as it was designed to assist consumers in capturing cherished family moments during outdoor and social activities, and instant sharing on social media. MULU, a creative home brand, also helps customers relish family moments as it transforms products by breaking conventional design perspectives by applying magnetic technology in creative household products, like a magnetic fluid speaker, to encourage consumers to discover the beautiful and interesting details in life. Ultimately, the TMF highlights the power of creativity and innovation among young entrepreneurs in China, as well as the growing importance for niche products that cater to the needs of consumers. It is a landmark event not only expected by consumers every year, but also by market players as it is a window for them to understand how Taobao supports and encourages the next generation of entrepreneurs, while getting a glimpse of the emerging consumption trends in China.
