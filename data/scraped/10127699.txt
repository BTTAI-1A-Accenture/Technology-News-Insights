 By Tomiwa Onaleye The success of fintechs in Africa didn‚Äôt happen overnight. Like fintechs, health techs operating in Africa know that there are no quick wins on the continent but it's well on its way to going viral. To overcome common obstacles in their path, the most successful startups in the sector like mPharma are laying down the path for others by adapting their business models to the unique needs and economic realities of the continent.¬† For example, an understanding of the variability between African markets has allowed mPharma to match its value proposition to new markets using a network of community pharmacies across regions. This has significantly increased access to primary healthcare service providers for millions of people residing in these regions. By filling the access gap, the startup has been able to grow rapidly raking in over $65 million in funding.  A similar pattern is unfolding in other successful startups spurred by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has driven a critical change in the health tech sector as attention is now being given to innovations,¬†technological advancements,¬† globalization of health needs, favourable regulation, and solutions to infrastructure voids.  To achieve self-sustainability in the event of another global health crisis, African governments and health stakeholders are taking action through policies and product development. This has propagated several trends that would help accelerate the sector. Growing cashless economy In Africa, less than 10% of transactions are made using electronic payment and most of its healthcare services are paid out of pocket. This means that the dropping of purchasing power across the continent due to the current economic climate has a significant impact on the sector.¬† On the other hand, this gap presents a new frontier for the healthcare sector and an opportunity for stakeholders and investors. Health techs have a large market opportunity to create new solutions that migrate Africa‚Äôs population from cash-based to innovations that allow for better services like health insurance. Fast growth in spending The inability of users to pay for services is a leading cause for startups shutting their doors in Africa. The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) in Africa is currently low, at $1,505 per capita compared to $5,433 in Latin America and $49,423 in North America. Technext‚Äôs Communication Manager, Oluwadamilare Akinpelu, sharing his insights on the health tech sector, expressed that the cost factor of using these health tech services is sometimes too high for an average Nigerian and this hinders their widespread adoption. However, that is changing, according to reports Africa‚Äôs spending capacity is forecasted to increase at a rate of 4.8% CAGR between 2020‚Äì2025. Also, with Africa‚Äôs healthcare market being valued in the magnitude of billions of dollars and over a billion people spending regularly to access healthcare, Wella Health‚Äôs founder, Ikpeme Neto believes that the demand for healthcare will never go away.  He, however, added that the main challenge and a huge potential for investors is the fragmentation of demand and supply in the sector. ‚ÄúThe challenge is in the fragmentation of demand and supply. Matching these effectively provides one of the largest opportunities for investors to make massive returns.‚Äù Urbanizing population At 2.7%, Africa has the world‚Äôs highest population growth rate. As Africa‚Äôs population grows, so too does urbanization, and by 2045 it is estimated that more than 1 billion people in Africa will live in urbanized areas.¬† Adeniyi Adeyemi, a co-founder of APN-African Professional Network, believes access to Healthcare is a basic right that everyone should enjoy. Sadly, the African healthcare sector is heavily underfunded and unsurprisingly underdeveloped.¬† Like many investors prioritizing impact, Adeniyi is interested in any solutions that help solve Africa's healthcare problem for Africa‚Äôs growing population. ‚ÄúEven basic primary care which forms the bedrock of healthcare delivery globally is not organized, adequately spread around urban and rural areas and where available, not functioning properly. Any solution at all that bridges this gap at any level is very much of interest to me.‚Äú Young Today, Old Tomorrow With a median age of twenty (20), Africa has a new generation of the young, urbanized and digitally-savvy population born in an era when digital technologies flourish.¬†They provide a fast-growing customer base that is primed to adopt digital solutions to meet their healthcare needs. On the other side, health care is a play on demographics and an ageing population. The high population of young Africa today means that there will be a high population of old citizens in future. As the generation ages the demand and spending on healthcare are likely to increase. Mature bodies need medical care to maintain their well-being, reports show that individuals 65 or older now account for 34% of the demand for physicians and by 2034 will account for 42%. Digital penetration growth Digital penetration in Africa is increasing exponentially, over 300 million people in Africa gained access to the internet between 2010 and 2019.¬† Barriers to connectivity such as high data prices, and high device prices are constantly shrinking leading to higher penetration growth year on year. This offers the ability to blend technology with health care to drive future growth. It also opens the sector up to the use of healthcare products and services with advanced technology such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and 3D printing.¬†¬†¬† However, Technext‚Äôs Damilare shares concerns about the low level of health literacy among the general population. He explains that this has led to reduced adoption of health technologies as citizens may not understand the benefits of health tech services or how to use them. Increased funding for innovation Startup funding in Africa is growing faster than in any other market, increasing by over 200% between 2020 and 2021. For the health tech sector, the COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated investment and digitalization trends as it is difficult to put a value on critical health needs like vaccines, cancer drugs and pacemakers.¬† Capital is becoming more readily available for entrepreneurs as investors are reminded of the importance and potential of innovation in health care. While most sectors dropped in venture capital funding in 2020 due to the pandemic, health tech funding grew by more than 250% up from $28.8 million raised in 2019.¬† For Investors still having doubts about investing in the sector, Fleri‚Äôs CEO, Sam Baddoo iterated the increasing focus on digital health solutions and new investment opportunities,¬† in light of the recent pandemic. He added that the presence of a large, untapped market and the increase in government support for healthcare businesses provide a strong foundation for investment. These favourable tailwinds in the health sector point to the fact that the sector is primed for disruptive innovation, making it an attractive opportunity for foreign investors. Health care presents the opportunity to invest in companies that are constantly innovating to improve quality of life and raise productivity.  Globally, Health care continues to offer investors valuable long-term opportunity potential.¬† We have seen health techs evolving to achieve scale. Similarly, in Africa young ventures are creating new opportunities for healthcare beyond the traditional pharmacy, insurance and health facilities. Examples are the likes of Fleri and Wellahealth, who are leveraging new and exciting opportunities at the intersection of health tech and fintech. The potential ahead is immense from data to medicine and technology, the sector has a myriad of innovative solutions to solve the pain points of citizens. However, all stakeholders have a critical part to play in unlocking the next wave of growth - which has a billion-dollar potential. Final Year Med Student‚Ä¢ Substack blog @thenotaghealthtalk Phenomenal!ü§ó The point about the lack of health literacy in Africa being the reason many people have distrust in health technology is a big issue. 
The HealthTech industry is a dynamic market like Fintechs, but convincing people of the benefit of digitalization in healthcare is almost an uphill battle. 
And that‚Äôs where awareness campaigns and articles like this come in. 
Well done Bantaba  and Tomiwa Onaleye ü§ó
