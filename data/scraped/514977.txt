LINA LANSBERG VS MAYRA BUENO SILVA LOWDOWN Lina Lansberg (10-7) has not won since 2019. That year, ‘The Elbow Queen’ reeled off two impressive unanimous decisions over Tonya Evinger and Macy Chiasson. She has only fought three times since taking some time off in 2021 welcoming a baby to the world and she has lost all three via unanimous decision. Firstly, to Sara McMann (2020) and then Pannie Kianzad (2022) and Karol Rosa (2022). We are not quite sure what she has done to get paired with Mayra Bueno Silva (9-2-1). After suffering the second loss of her career losing a unanimous decision to Manon Fiorot (2021), she stepped up from flyweight and looked superb. She started her bantamweight campaign with a unanimous decision over Yanan Wu (2022) and is coming off a first round submission over Stephanie Egger back in August. LINA LANSBERG VS MAYRA BUENO SILVA PREDICTION This is a tough fight for a 40-year-old mother on a three-fight skid. That said, she is incredibly tough and her Muay Thai is still at a very high level. Fortunately for her, Silva also prefers to stand and bang. She is a brilliant grappler with slick jiu-jitsu, but she relies on her hands. On paper, she should cruise this but the fact she is unlikely to attempt a takedown, gives Lansberg a chance. We are backing Silva especially if they end up on the ground. However, considering the miles on the clock and how powerful Silva is up at bantamweight, we are leaning towards a Brazilian knockout.
