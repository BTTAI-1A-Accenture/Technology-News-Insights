Having a dependable home security system installed not only adds an extra layer of protection but it can also bring peace of mind. If you’re looking for the best home security system for you and your home, we’ve got you covered. We've spent over 100 hours testing home security systems for our list, including products from big names to DIY home security systems. Right now we have SimpliSafe in our top spot with a lot of good items for a first-time security system, many ways to add to your system and AI-assisted monitoring agents.  If you prefer a professionally installed system, Comcast Xfinity Home may be your best option (if it's available where you live). If you want a security kit you can easily build out over a couple of years, Vivint is your best choice. We also have an excellent DIY option with Ring Alarm -- no contract necessary and sporting a relatively affordable subscription plan -- plus more picks to suit a variety of people. Whether you're looking for a system that works with your new video doorbell or want a complete package outfitted with sensors for every window, scroll further down to learn how we picked, what features you should always keep an eye on and what brands didn't make the cut.  We've tested the SimpliSafe system several times and most recently gave it a review score of 8.5 out of 10, one of our highest ratings for a home security system. If you're looking for home security -- without all the extra Wi-Fi and smart home integrations of the Ring Alarm kit -- SimpliSafe's easy-to-install, easy-to-use DIY system is a great option. It offers a comprehensive set of features, including equipment like security cameras and a very good mix of battery-powered motion detection sensors, all of which performed reliably well in our tests.  Starter kits begin at $280 without sales, or you can build a custom alarm system with the exact mix of devices you need. The security company's monitoring plans start at $10 a month, but you'll almost certainly want to spring for the $30-a-month professional monitoring service plan, which adds in things like 24/7 live guard protection, whole home monitoring, instant app alerts and faster response times. In all, it's one of the best choices for homeowners looking for their first smart home security kit as it is compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant, and the frequent deals (currently 50% off for some first-time buyers) make it even better. Vivint gives you a super-polished experience with third-party device integrations and it doesn't require a contract. The starter package includes only a touchscreen and a couple of sensors, but Vivint works well with voice assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa and supports a wide array of additional Vivint and third-party devices (see our full review for more). That's great news if you'd like to add a compatible smart garage door, video doorbell or security camera system, but on your terms and timing. You can also adjust your budget based on what you'd like to buy now and purchase later. Vivint is the only brand with this approach, but it has one of the best offerings to begin with a starter kit and build from there. With monthly monitoring ranging from $30 to $45 a month, it's more affordable than a subscription-like ADT and includes valuable extras like video storage. Unfortunately, these are some of the highest subscription costs on our list. It's becoming less and less common for security brands to charge so much for professional monitoring, but for these systems, if you want the pros to keep an eye on your home, you'll have to pay for it. Thanks to Abode’s frequent deals, you can find home starter kits for as low as $100, one of the cheapest options on the market. We suggest going up a step and picking the $220 smart security kit, which adds a motion sensor to the package and expands smart home compatibility to Apple Home/Siri as well as Alexa and Google Assistant. We know it’s not easy to find a home security system that works with the Apple Home app, especially at a low price, so Apple fans may be especially pleased. The tidy package is easy to manage once you’ve found a place for Abode’s block hub, and DIYers will appreciate the no-tools installation design (which also makes this a great pick for renters). Even with its big discounts, Abode’s system still has important features like battery backups. Abode also has deeply impressive third-party compatibility, supporting integrations with Nest, Yale, Philips Hue, Amazon Echos, Ecobee and more. If you already have smart devices, there’s a good chance they’ll be supported; check out the full list here. If you’re looking for professional monitoring, Abode does offer it with both plans, the Pro plan also includes cellular backup. Plans start at $70 per year, but saves you significant money compared to the most expensive plan. Ring offers some excellent home security packages for users who want to take everything into their own hands, from picking out add-ons to choosing just the right spot on the wall. This eight-piece starter kit provides four important sensors, a base station plus a keypad, a motion detector and a range extender for those worried about Wi-Fi. We also like the Pro version of this package, but the second-gen kit is a bit newer and doesn’t force you to use the built-in router (we prefer picking out our own routers). Amazon’s Ring devices include excellent Alexa support, and DIYers will like the largely intuitive management app (if you’ve set up any smart devices before, these app controls will come easily to you). In addition to direct controls and sensor notifications, users can also switch between home and away modes on the fly. If you decide to expand, almost any Ring product will be compatible including their security cameras and video doorbells, so it’s easy to level up. Two final important notes about choosing Ring: First, in 2024, Ring officially changed its policy on allowing police to directly request user video footage. Now they listen to such requests only in case of a life-or-death emergency, similar to Google and other brands but a noted improvement from their previous stance. Second, while Ring is very DIY-friendly, professional monitoring does require the brand's top-tier subscription for $20 per month. That’s lower than some of our other picks but still pricier than a cloud storage plan would be. Comcast Xfinity Home works to make things easy for compatible users, which is why we gave it an 8 out of 10 in our review. It could cost you less than comparable setups from direct competitors like Vivint and ADT, works with plenty of third-party smart home gadgets and doesn't require a contract.  Xfinity's base home system currently starts at $360, including a touchscreen hub, three access point sensors for doors and windows and a motion sensor for key points inside a home. You can also add other devices like an Xfinity camera, thermostat or smoke detector but we suggest making use of the available third-party support instead. Xfinity's system can work with August, Yale, Lifx, Ecobee, Philips Hue and other smart home brands, so you have plenty of options. Subscription packages are divided into self-monitoring and professional monitoring tiers, with the $10 per month self-monitoring giving you Wi-Fi, third-party support and app control. That makes it a requirement to use this system, so we suggest planning for at least the lower tier. If you can get around Comcast's pressure to bundle with their other services and the service's limited home automation capabilities, this home security system will treat you well.  SimpliSafe home security systems can be easily tailored to your needs. Just simply add or subtract hardware and equipment as you please.  When choosing a home security system for your home, you may be tempted to start by deciding between a DIY setup or one that is professionally installed and monitored. When you consider the equipment, installation, monitoring options and other features you want, you'll probably reach a DIY-versus-pro system decision along the way. Here are some more parameters to consider when shopping around for home security systems: Do you just need to keep watch over your entryways? A good video doorbell for your front door and an outdoor camera covering the back may be all you need; easy to install and monitor yourself. If you want to keep closer tabs on your home inside and out with 24/7 monitoring and quick access to emergency response services, you'll want a more robust system. DIY and professional brands offer home security bundles with most, if not all, of the equipment you'd need to get started and the ability to add single devices as needed. Most home security devices are compatible with Alexa and Google Home smart hubs, but if you prefer Apple HomeKit or another smart home ecosystem, you may have to do a bit more shopping and comparing to find a system compatible with your existing smart home devices. Don't fret over compatibility too much as Matter will make it easier to connect previously noncompatible devices (although it hasn't quite come for security cameras yet). Keep in mind all that equipment will need to be installed. While there isn't much to installing a security camera or even a wired video doorbell, whole-home systems can be a bit more demanding to install and set up. Some are DIY-friendly and use adhesive to position devices without leaving permanent marks, but not all systems do this. If you'd rather leave that to an expert and have them walk you through how to use the system, a professional home security service may be the way to go.    Arlo's app is simple and intuitive to use. Virtually all home security systems allow for self-monitoring, likely via an app on your phone. They'll also send you push notifications when there's an event, such as when a package is delivered to your doorstep.  Consider whether you want to be in charge of all the monitoring or if you'd like some support. A professional system will come with 24/7 monitoring, but you may be able to add professional monitoring to your DIY system for a fee, depending on the brand you choose. More advanced features, such as facial recognition, glass break sensors and communication with emergency services may not be available from all manufacturers and devices. Consider the level of monitoring you want, and who you want to do it, along with the emergency response options, when choosing a home security system.    We listed "cost" last here for a reason. A complete home security system will likely cost you at least a couple of hundred bucks, so be prepared for that. There's the potential to spend lots more on equipment, or a lot less; maybe a $35 security camera will satisfy your security needs. Also, keep in mind that the size of the system greatly affects the cost. Starter systems like many we listed here typically cost between $150 and $300, and allow you to add other compatible devices over time. Larger systems with 10 devices or more will cost at least several hundred dollars and can go up to $1,000 or more, depending on the tech that's included. Ongoing costs can carry a bit more weight when choosing the best security system. Expect ongoing monthly fees from a professional service and possibly a contract to lock you into those fees for a year or two (although we favored picks without a required contract). Signing a contract may not be ideal, but it may also come with free equipment or installation and lower upfront costs.  If you're comfortable with self-monitoring, DIY systems may not come with any ongoing costs. Monthly subscriptions (without a contract) for cloud storage, enhanced features and possibly even professional monitoring are typically an option with DIY systems, often for lower monthly fees than professional services. Hands-on testing is core to our evaluations of any home security products. In short, when it comes to the best home security systems, we pay special attention to the user experience, the promised features, reliability and overall value, along with a few other elements. We do the testing in a real home environment over at least a full week. This includes testing sensors at common access points, seeing how systems arm and disarm, and finding out how voice controls and smart device integration work with the app. Along the way, we keep a careful eye on durability and design quality so we avoid recommending any shoddy products. To read more about our review process, check out our in-depth article on how we test home security systems and services. The Ring Alarm Pro offers a slew of excellent features -- and we tested everyone of them.  Besides the systems above, we've tested many of the top competitors, including Abode Iota, Frontpoint, Kangaroo, Cove and ADT. DIY systems Frontpoint, Cove and Kangaroo all had features to recommend them. Frontpoint's system is reliable, and its hardware is reasonably priced, but its $45 monthly monitoring fee is too expensive. Kangaroo, by contrast, is incredibly wallet-friendly, but its doorbell camera is terrible. Cove Home Security, despite reasonable hardware prices, fell to an overly restrictive subscription model that doesn't allow for self-monitoring or app access without significant monthly fees. ADT, one of the biggest brands we've tested, was broadly disappointing. It's too expensive, requires a contract and the app is clunky. We've tested AT&T Digital Life too, although we've removed the system from consideration since the company stopped installing it for new customers. As for Wyze, we appreciate its excellent budget home security offerings, but we're holding off on recommending it at this time. Wyze has been struggling with frequent security vulnerabilities in recent years, a problem it doesn't seem to have under control at this time. If we see signs that Wyze is making strides in privacy and security, we'll consider its newest systems for our list too. Contracts are sometimes required for professional home monitoring or to qualify for free equipment, so service from home security providers like ADT, Vivint and Xfinity may include one. It's usually possible to avoid contracts if you pay upfront and other home security companies like Ring, SimpliSafe and Wyze offer DIY home security solutions that never require one. Arlo and Nest cameras are our top picks for the best home security cameras, but the best one for your home depends on your needs. Be sure to consider price, Wi-Fi connectivity, indoor/outdoor functionality and compatibility with other smart home devices and security services when choosing. Some home security systems come with professional installation, so you can rely on the company to install and set up your system. Others, including many DIY systems, may require self-installation and setup. These systems should come with detailed instructions and are often easy to set up. In most cases, you can simply place or mount the devices where desired, then connect them to your Wi-Fi and other smart home devices (if compatible) via an app. In a home security context, there are two ways to look at "wired" versus "wireless." The first is power; home security systems require electricity to operate. In that context, a wired system would be one with devices that plug into power and rely on your home's electricity. A fair number of current-gen systems use wireless, battery-powered sensors and battery backups for the base stations that will keep the setup running if the power ever goes out. You can think of those systems as "wireless" as far as electricity is concerned. There's a second way to look at wired versus wireless. It concerns connectivity. Every home security system needs to be able to notify you when there's a problem and alert the authorities when there's an emergency. It used to be that systems would notify you with the sound of the alarm and contact authorities via a wired connection to your phone line. Now, most current-gen systems can also notify users of issues with a push alert on their phones. Some will use an internet connection to contact professionals during an emergency. Even then, we'd still consider the system "wired" if you can stop it from operating by cutting your home's internet signal. That's why many systems include built-in cellular connectivity as a backup. Even if the Wi-Fi goes out (or if a tech-savvy intruder disables it), a system like that will still be able to notify you and the authorities of an emergency by way of that cellular connection. Systems like those are "wireless" in the connectivity sense, and if they double down with a battery backup as well, then they're as wireless as home security gets. Some security systems offer all-in-one devices that are meant to be placed in a central location where they can watch everything, although we hesitate to recommend them compared to a whole security system. First, security cameras have come a long way (including two-way audio, motion sensors, audio detection, and smart alerts), so even advanced standalone devices like the Canary Pro offer little that a new security camera doesn’t have. You may as well get a home security camera that’s compatible with your current system and has the benefits of both. Second, all-in-one devices have motion detectors but they’re very poor at monitoring access points like doors or windows, which is where home security systems really shine. We will give a nod to Arlo&#x2019;s interesting all-in-one sensor that detects a whole assortment of household ills, which could save you some money if you're using an Arlo system.
