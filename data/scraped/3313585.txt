 Private and Corporate Utilities : Newsletter 65, by David Lipschitz BSc (Honours) MBA - A consultant working at the intersection of energy and business.  South Africa has been experiencing Electrical System Failure (Load Shedding) since 2008. Each year prices dramatically increase. We are told that this is so that investment can be made in fixing the system, but we also know that each time the price increases, the quality decreases. It's a paradox! In a typical business, as the price increases, the quality goes up, or the ability of the company to deliver goes up, or the ability of the company to make more products goes up, or all three happen. For Eskom and many other State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), their ability to make their products decreases as the price increases. Alongside Load Shedding, at Stage 4 (about 7.5 hours a day of no electricity) or higher, and especially at Stage 6 (about 11.5 hours a day of no electricity) or higher, there is Communications Shedding. Even if one has 24-hour electricity, with one's own generation, and one's suppliers, eg Internet Service Providers (ISP's) and the companies that house themselves at ISP's, have their own generation, there are still multiple and worsening communications failures. It's one thing having to deal with Load Shedding and Power Failures. It's quite another also having to deal with Communications Shedding, where the communication grid is down between the supplier (eg ISP) and client (eg myself). I make phone calls. 147 years ago, the phone was invented. By 1964, when I was born, the quality of the calls was incredible. The only worry we had in the old South Africa was that the South African government was listening to our calls, so if we wanted to have a private conversation, we disconnected the phone at the wall. The rumour was that "they" could listen to us, even if the phone was down. Today we have a different problem with our cell phones listening to us, even if we switch off Siri and everything else! By 2023, we find ourselves not only with Electricity Supply Failures (Load Shedding) but also with Communications Failures, as the Communications grid (backbone) that connects suppliers and clients goes down. Our incredibly competent government has decided in their wisdom to ban Starlink, which might be the only decent communications mechanism left for long-distance communications in a few months. Obviously, I can talk to people I can see. And I can use walkie-talkies for speaking to people further away, and those walkie-talkies allow "mesh" networks to be set up and so that will be one way to communicate. But that is still very slow, relative to the speeds I get when I use Fibre to the Home (FTTH). What to do? Luckily we live in a democracy in South Africa. And luckily, our democracy works. And luckily, our government still listens to their people, which they still call "our people". But the government only listens when people write, and all their email addresses and contact numbers are available online (when there isn't communications shedding), for example, at Parliament dot gov dot za. This URL shows Ministers. Click on their name for their email address. Click on "Our People" and the drop-down for other email addresses. You have a responsibility to write and to ask. I've written hundreds of emails over the years. I've written legal submissions. I've made countless suggestions. Many have been adopted, but don't expect thanks. But know that what you have written has contributed to how your country is, today, and tomorrow.
