                                    Until now, I haven’t been a fan of billionaire businessperson Mark Cuban. However, based on what I saw last week in his interview with Jon Stewart on "The Daily Show," I couldn’t have been more wrong about him...
 The Current Backyard Model G Dual-Zone Grill is an ideal electric alternative. It offers gas-like barbecue performance and smart features for everyday grilling. During a layoff, employees confront difficult and unexpected choices. A wrong move could not only derail your career but also lead to legal trouble if decisions are made impulsively without weighing the risks. The discussion at Siggraph between Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang was fascinating, especially in terms of what they didn’t discuss -- the future of Facebook with AI. Based on their conversation, I believe I can fill that gap. Let's discuss the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, the current state of EVs, and the role of AI in the automotive industry. Then, we’ll close with my Product of the Week: an impressive automotive diagnostic tool. Last week, Intel shared how its AI technology will be a significant part of the Olympics experience. If Intel pulls this off, it would be a huge boost to its AI efforts. AMD just announced it will close that gap with a class of PCs that have the graphics and processor performance demanded by creators. These are machines with discrete graphics cards and the power to meet the needs of those who demand the highest performance yet still want all the advantages that AI b... Mark Vena reviews new headphones from Heavys and Sonos. Both showcase distinct features and sound profiles that cater to different listening preferences. I’ve received my first two Copilot+ PCs to review, and both are impressive products. I got a gorgeous HP EliteBook Ultra 14 and the Surface Laptop, 7th Edition, both of which have just started shipping. Let’s talk about Copilot+ PCs this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, the b... Over the last several weeks, we’ve had Google I/O, which highlighted the rollout of Google’s Gemini AI engine for smartphones; Microsoft Build, which focused on its Copilot+ rollout for PCs; and Apple’s WWDC24 video, which showcased the rollout of AI on both PCs and smartphones. Let’s explor... Prior to WWDC24, AI meant artificial intelligence to most consumers. In classic Apple-esque fashion, we now know the Cupertino-based company wants to redefine AI as "Apple Intelligence." I watched IBM Think last week. As I listened to IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, it struck me that we are not thinking AI through. We are throwing AI at everything without prioritizing where we need it to focus. When we talk about AI, we typically focus on productivity, but our real problem is poor decision support, not the lack of productivity or performance. Having Google I/O immediately followed by Microsoft Build, with both conferences focused on AI, provided an interesting contrast between the two companies’ approaches to AI. Microsoft is all about PCs for AI integration, while Google is all about smartphones. Microsoft blindsided Google with Copilot on search but failed to market the advantage successfully or advance it significantly enough to avoid a huge pushback from Google. That pushback happened last week at Google I/O, and it was an impressive showing. 



Over the next few years, I expect AI to make my daily life...
