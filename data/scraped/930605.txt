 David Sinclair spent 30 years working in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa - "not the most democratic countries in the world," he said. While overseas, he managed the implementation and operation of  surveillance systems that tracked people through their mobile phones and collected their personal data. Sinclair said he was surveilled in those countries, and when he returned to the United States, he was shocked to find how ubiquitous surveillance was in that country too. "We live in a surveillance society," he said. People are concerned about the lack of privacy, but they don't know what to do about it, Sinclair said. So he founded 4Freedom Mobile - a mobile service provider that helps subscribers secure their phones and stop the tracking, hacking and data theft that occur every day. "Our focus is companies that want to have a BYOD policy but want to figure out a way to keep those devices as secure as possible," he said.
 In this episode of CyberEd.io's podcast series "Cybersecurity Insights," Sinclair discussed: Sinclair spent 30 years managing the implementation and operation of  IT systems in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
