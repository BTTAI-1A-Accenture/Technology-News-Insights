Michigan football received a commitment on Saturday, a day after the Wolverines landed four-star wide receiver I’Marion Stewart. This time, the maize and blue gained another running back when 2024 three-star Micah Kaapana chose Michigan over Hawaii, Nebraska and Oregon State. According to the 247Sports composite, the 5-foot-11, 195-pound, back is the 733rd-ranked player in the 2024 cycle and the 55th-best running back. Kaapana plays for a national powerhouse in high school in Las Vegas (Nevada) Bishop Gorman. As a junior, Kaapana rushed for 1,001 yards on just 70 carries. He also ran for 15 touchdowns last season. He produced 192 receiving yards and four scores. Michigan has 21 commitments in the 2024 class, and Kaapana joins four-star Jordan Marshall as the two running back commitments for the Wolverines. Here are the best Twitter reactions after Kaapana pledged to Michigan.

Micah Ka'apana has some of the best RB highlights I have seen.He's RB1 heading into his senior season at powerhouse Bishop Gorman. Building off of 1000+ yards and 15 touchdowns on just 70 carries makes him a sleeper…for now.https://t.co/29dNj80cSp — Trevor McCue (@trevormccue) June 17, 2023  BREAKING: #Michigan is getting an aggressive, slash-and-dash running back in Micah Kaapana of Las Vegas (Nev.)

Watch him blow up his senior year. 1000 yards on 70 carries his junior year is insane. — Josh Henschke (@JoshHenschke) June 17, 2023  LIGHTNING AND LIGHTNING PART 2!!! @MHart2032 #Born2Play4Michigan ⚡️ ⚡️ pic.twitter.com/HjYNKB7uw9 — Albert Karschnia (@AKarsch_UM) June 17, 2023  Michigan got an absolute steal here.
