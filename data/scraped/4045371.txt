A Nevada judge has ruled a Colorado dentist unfit for trial following his arrest last month in what authorities characterized as a terror attack on a solar power facility serving Las Vegas Strip casinos. Mohammed Reza Mesmarian’s attorney, Nick Pitaro, said Wednesday that two psychiatrists found his client was unable to understand the criminal charges against him, including terrorism, arson, destruction of property and escape. Clark County District Court Judge Christy Craig ordered Mesmarian, 34, to remain in custody at one of Nevada’s forensic psychiatric facilities pending further evaluation, Pitaro said. CO MAN SAYS HE SET A FIRE AT A NV SOLAR POWER SITE TO SHOW SUPPORT FOR CLEAN ENERGY The MGM Mega Solar Array facility is seen in an aerial view northeast of Las Vegas on Jan. 10, 2023. Mohammed Reza Mesmarian, 34, is facing charges including terrorism, arson, and destruction of property and escape, after he allegedly attacked the solar facility. (Bizuayehu Tesfaye/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP) Mesmarian is accused of ramming a car through a fence and setting the vehicle afire early Jan. 4 at a sprawling solar array in the desert northeast of Las Vegas. He was arrested later in a recreational vehicle at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. The alleged attack followed several incidents and arrests involving electrical substations in states including Washington, Oregon and North Carolina and concerns expressed by federal officials about security of the nation’s electricity transmission network.

The array, owned by Chicago-based Invenergy, serves several Las Vegas Strip properties operated by MGM Resorts International. A casino company official said properties switched to the statewide electric grid and hotel guests and gamblers saw no effect. Mesmarian lived in Aurora, Colorado, where state records showed he faced Dental Board discipline and his dentist license was restricted last July. Court records show that he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October. The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.
