PR and comms monitoring group Onclusive has launched a CEO Index, analysing media coverage of the leaders of the US and Europe's biggest listed companies. BP's Bernard Looney has been named top ranking CEO in the UK, based on an overall impact score.Onclusive was formed at the start of 2022 when software investor Symphony Technology Group (STG) completed its acquisition of Kantar's Reputation Intelligence business, along with two other firms, media management software provider PRgloo and data science company Onclusive. The three businesses were immediately merged, taking the Onclusive name.

The new CEO Index measures media coverage of the CEOs from the US Fortune 100, UK FTSE 100, French CAC 40, German DAX 30, Swiss SMI 30, Spanish IBEX 35, Italian IT 40 and Irish Euronext Dublin 20. It categorises and scores all CEOs against five topics - financial performance, leadership, sustainability, innovation, and regulation; and has been designed to identify who is gaining the highest volume of coverage, how CEOs compare, and who is 'leading the debate' on business issues.

Philip Lynch (pictured), SVP Insights and Consulting, comments: 'We started tracking the media engagement of CEOs over a year ago and now have an open resource for communicators and journalists to analyse the media engagement of global business leaders across all sectors, regions and key topics. That a CEO of a smaller company doesn't have the same media presence as a titan of the sector is unlikely to surprise. But if a CEO outperforms their peers, and starts to close in on the sector leader, that's when it becomes interesting to understand the reasons why'.
