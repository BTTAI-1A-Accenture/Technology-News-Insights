FOLLOW DEVELOPING TELECOMS  Flō Networks, a provider of digital infrastructure solutions, has announced that it has completed the acquisition of American Tower's Mexico fibre business, ATC Holding Fibra México (known commercially as redIT), and its high-capacity fibre optic network, which maintains a dense presence in over 40 cities throughout Mexico. In fact, the acquisition was completed on 29 March this year, though it appears that it is only now being publicised. Explaining how the acquired business will complement Flō’s existing network, Miguel Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer of Flō Networks, says: "The combination of these two unique and complementary networks will enable redIT's dense metro footprints throughout Mexico to leverage Flō's diverse long-haul and metro networks, providing reliable and redundant routes to transport mission-critical data back to the United States and beyond.” The combined company will have over 20,000 miles of fibre throughout the United States and Mexico that will connect nearly 10,000 enterprise buildings. Founded as Transtelco in 2001, Flō Networks is a digital infrastructure service provider that supplies managed data and voice services to Fortune 500, telecommunications and cable companies over a fibre optic network between the US and Mexico and connects fifteen countries across the Americas. Flō Networks maintains what it describes as one of the most scalable and low-latency networks in the region.
