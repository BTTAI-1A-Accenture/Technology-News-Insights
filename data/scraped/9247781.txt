However, it can be difficult to keep all the documents your team creates organized and to ensure everyone who needs access to them has it. This problem is further compounded as businesses grapple with potentially upwards of terabytes of data. Document management software allows teams to collaborate with varying levels of access and permission based on their role within the company. The best document control software provides an auditable record of changes over time, as well, including versioning control that enables permitted users to revert to a previous version of a document at any time.  Document management software empowers organizations by making it easy to securely track and manage large numbers of files and organizational data.

We especially liked that Dropbox can also be used anywhere, so teams that work remotely can connect and search for documents as if they were working in the office. When working remotely, Dropbox offers mobile offline folders. We also liked that it comes with the option of a remote account wipe, which can help you remove sensitive data from a lost or stolen device before it falls into the wrong hands.

Document management software can vary widely in pricing and cost structure. The first and perhaps most important factor in the cost of your document management system is whether you select a cloud-based or on-premises version. Cloud-based document management software takes the infrastructure maintenance and burden of security off your business and places it with a third-party company. While this reduces the expense and challenge of managing it in-house, you’ll just have to trust that the company is handling your data properly. Cloud-based software is typically paid for on a subscription basis. For most document management software, this could range from $15 to $200 per month per user, depending on the complexity of the solution you choose. On-premises versions of document management software require your own servers and, generally, a dedicated information technology staff for maintenance. Your business is wholly responsible for the security of your data, but this also means you have full control over your own data. With on-premises solutions, you generally have to purchase a license for each user. Each license can cost $1,000 or more, but it is a one-time fee. However, on-premises solutions typically charge an additional fee for technical support and software updates after the first year, which is usually about 20 percent of the initial licensing cost. For small businesses looking for software that is easy to manage and not a large overhead expense, we recommend a cloud-based solution. However, make sure your provider adheres to the best cybersecurity practices to protect your data. The actual price for document management software varies by company. Systems with more complex features tend to cost more while costs for basic document management software without extra features (such as task management tools and workflow automation functions) can be pretty low. Also, the more users you add to a cloud-based system, the higher the monthly subscription price will be. Cloud-based document management software typically costs between $15 and $200 per user, per month. The price varies on how many features and tools you want access to.  While all document management systems digitize and organize documents, making them easy to retrieve and revise for users with permission, many other features might be built into your document management software. Here’s a look at some of the tools and aspects you might want to consider when choosing a document management system. One of the most important elements of any software is usability. It could offer all the features in the world, but they won’t do you any good if the system isn’t user-friendly. Many document management systems offer free trials that allow you to test them before buying. If possible, allow your team to try out the software during the free trial period and offer their feedback on what they like and dislike about it. Since everyone has to use the system, be sure all stakeholders get the opportunity to test it out and provide insight about their experience before buying. While the primary function of a document management system is to digitize and organize files, most modern software also allows users to share files and collaborate on editing them. Some document management software allows users to edit a document simultaneously while others rely on a check-in/checkout feature that guarantees only one user can work on a document at a time. Others offer both options. Determine which is best for your team’s workflow and the types of documents you collaborate on together.  Document management software should make it easy to upload, download, and export data. Here, a DocuWare user configures and exports data to their desired location. (Source: DocuWare) Version control, sometimes referred to as “versioning,” is a critical feature of document management software that lets you keep track of changes to a document. The best document management software even maintains an archive of old versions, letting you see how documents have changed over time and revert to an old version if needed. This is especially important when collaborating to edit documents as human error could result in important information being altered or deleted. With version control, you can revert to an old version of the document and recover any lost information easily.  Version control helps organizations track changes to a document, as well as when the change was made and by whom. In this example, a series of changes can be seen to a test document in M-Files. (Source: M-Files) Image scanning and OCR are useful features for businesses that have a lot of paper records they would like to digitize. Scanning is the first step in turning a paper record into a digital file that can be imported into the software. OCR is a more advanced feature, but it’s a necessity for streamlining large digitization projects. OCR reads the text of an image and makes the content of the image searchable. The best document management systems use OCR to fill out metadata automatically and make it even easier to search for the document later. Document management software is often home to files that require a manager’s signature, such as purchase orders (POs). Many document management systems integrate with an e-signature tool, such as DocuSign, to allow electronic signatures. You can often send a document to a recipient with a request for their signature through the software. This can improve efficiency when it comes to getting clients to sign important documents or when onboarding new employees to the company, helping you to sign and store files in one central location. Workflow automation features move tasks along automatically. Take a PO workflow as an example: You could set up workflow automation so that once a PO is generated, it goes to the appropriate manager automatically for their signature. The manager will receive a notification, and when the task is complete, the next relevant team member, such as someone in the accounting department or the manager’s supervisor, will be notified. If more action is necessary, you might be able to build that into the automated workflow as well. The best document management systems allow you to customize workflows to suit the way your teams work together.  Templates and automation are key features of a customizable and scalable system. In this example, a user uses FileHold to configure templates for auto-filing certain types of documents, as well as automating push email notifications for certain actions within the system. (Source: FileHold) Automated workflows can help streamline your business processes and maintain legal compliance.
 An essential element of document management software is the ability for administrators to set individual user permissions. Permissions allow certain users to view or edit files while others can be prevented from even seeing those documents in the system. Not only is this useful for efficiency purposes, but it is also an important security measure. The best document management software allows administrators to set permissions by specific groups, as well as to change permissions on the fly if you need to make an exception while keeping the default permissions settings the same. Many document management systems have a dedicated mobile app. Others rely on web browsers or online portals. Make sure the mobile version of any document management software you are considering is truly mobile-friendly. Even if you personally don’t use it on mobile devices, it is likely other members of your team will. Not every document management system checks all these boxes while others offer all of them and more. When choosing your document management software, consider which tools and features would be most useful to your business. It is important to strike a balance between comprehensiveness and usability. Some systems can do it all but are a challenge to navigate (not to mention more expensive than simpler software). Data security is a vital part of any document management system. As an increasing number of businesses go digital, more customers are entrusting sensitive personal information to the companies they do business with. Your organization is responsible for ensuring sensitive information is safe and protected from a data breach. Look for document management services that offer encryption and compliance tools, auto-updates, data redundancy and backups. Researching the document management market will help you understand the most common and important features of document management software. Understand the most basic document management software elements like centralized document storage, built-in collaboration and task management, mobile functionality and data security. Identify market leaders and vet your options before selecting the right software for your organization. Understand your unique document management needs as a business. For instance, maybe you’re seeking a digital archive that can be updated periodically, or perhaps you’d prefer software that enables the daily creation and editing of new documents. Weigh the benefits of a locally hosted, on-premises solution in relation to a cloud-based solution managed by your vendor partner or a third party. Get specific with what you require in a system before searching. A good document management system is also easy to implement and scale. The complexity of the software should be based on your team’s technical know-how, allowing them to store and locate documents easily as needed. Your team should be able to share documents and collaborate within the platform, even when they are using mobile devices. Although every document management system should have security protocols, access controls and file versioning, these features are especially important for those operating within heavily regulated industries. Other features that lend to a document management system’s usability are metadata and tagging options, keyword searching, document editing history and restoration, automatic document retention and deletion, image scanning, optical character recognition and customizable workflows. The best software can also integrate with your other business platforms. Once you understand what you need from document management software, ask the following questions to software providers: Additionally, read through customer reviews to get a more grounded understanding of each service’s pros and cons. This is where you’ll get the most authentic and holistic view of a particular software and its offerings. Once you choose document management software and are ready to sign a contract, closely read any legal documents and ensure everything you’ve discussed is in writing, including which features you are getting for your money. Additionally, ensure there is a fair exit strategy included in your contract that does not threaten you with outrageous fees. Once you start using your document management software, regularly test your performance with it to optimize your workflow. Do this by inputting and storing documents, granting access to your team to make edits or updates to documents and testing document security to ensure your data is safe. Should you run into any issues, address your concerns with the software provider. If they are unable or unwilling to resolve these issues, consider terminating your contract. Assess your options and consider your unique needs as a business before deciding which document management software is best for you.  A document management system can improve efficiency for you and your staff by organizing all of your files and making them easy for anyone in the organization to find. A good document management software is more than just a file cabinet, but an interactive depository for all the files your organization needs. If you are currently using a manual system, you are costing yourself hours that could otherwise be spent on other, more pressing business matters. A document management system automates many aspects of document management, taking that responsibility off your hands. A document management system is more flexible than a traditional paper filing system. It accommodates your business’s growth easily, and your indexing system can be adjusted with a few clicks. For growing businesses, most document management software providers offer multiple pricing tiers, so you can increase your storage capacity as the size of your organization increases. Ensuring that your information is secure is critical, from customer payment information to company trade secrets. Document management systems come with built-in security and access controls so you determine who can access certain documents. In addition, you can see all activity on any given document. In the event of a disaster, like a fire or flood, your files are stored safely in the cloud, away from physical harm. Searching for the right document can be difficult and time-consuming; it can even cost you money. With the right indexing system, finding a document can take mere seconds, and employees can access the documents they need remotely. The best systems apply appropriate metadata and tagging automatically to make finding documents even easier, without much need to classify them on the front end. Organizations can lose thousands of hours of productivity each year due to poor document management. Discover some other benefits of a paperless office.
 Compliance requirements for many business documents can be complex and demanding, but a document management system can help you avoid fines, revoked licenses or even criminal liability by automating key documents within the requirements. For example, HIPAA and the Sarbanes-Oxley anti-fraud law have strict security and policy regulations regarding documents and records. The best document management systems automatically follow those guidelines, so you can rest easy knowing your business is compliant and has an auditable trail of required documents. A document management system makes sharing information and collaboration easy, allowing documents from different sources to be accessed from multiple locations. Users can also share documents, monitor workflows, grant or deny access to certain documents. In recent years, document management software has been increasingly moving into the cloud, a model that’s more affordable and easier to maintain than the on-premises model. We expect this trend to continue, particularly as more teams adopt remote and hybrid work as a permanent arrangement. The document management software business industry is expected to grow steadily in 2024 and beyond. Market research from Fortune Business Insights suggests the industry will reach a year-over-year growth of 17.2 percent by 2030, increasing from $6.23 billion in 2023 to $18.97 billion in 2030. This increase in value can be attributed in part to the growth of AI-powered solutions. Document management platforms are leveraging AI to automate workflows, improve search capabilities, analyze data, bolster security and ensure legal compliance. As technology continues to evolve, we expect further adoption and capabilities of AI in document management.

To learn more about how we review and test products and services for small businesses, read about our editorial process here.  Document management systems are used for several things, including securely storing important documents, tracking changes made to documents and sharing documents easily between members of an organization. A document management system also makes it easy to find certain files by assigning keywords and tags to each document. These systems can also help companies ensure compliance for sensitive documents, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, by providing required security and permission restrictions on certain key documents. A document management system captures the document, which is done by scanning the physical document or downloading a digital version via email or using other applications. Next, the document is indexed, meaning it is classified with tags, keywords and metadata that make it so it can be searchable. Finally, the document is organized and placed in a folder, where it can be accessed by the appropriate employees. Most document management systems are cloud-based, so once a file is appropriately secured into the system, it can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection. The best document management system should be easy to use; it should allow for document sharing; and it should have collaboration tools, mobile functionality and version control. The first two features allow your team to work together on critical documents without needing to be in the same office. Version control maintains a log of every change (and who made it) to your company’s documents. You’ll also want to make sure the software you choose offers airtight security protocols to ensure that only those with the right permissions can access files.
