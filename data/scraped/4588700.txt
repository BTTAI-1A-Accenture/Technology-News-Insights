By Fiyin Olowokandi on May 20, 2023 at 11:00 PM EDT Emma Heming Willis is taking her passion for brain health and wellness to another level!  The wife of Hollywood veteran Bruce Willis has advocated for mental health since her husband was diagnosed with Frontotemporal dementia. Although Heming didn't see this ailment coming, she put her all into caring for her husband and gaining knowledge about the illness. Most recently, she used her accumulated knowledge of brain health to start a critical venture. She recently launched a new supplement brand to support the brain's well-being in line with the former supermodel's passion. Heming broke the big news of the product on her Instagram with a picture of herself holding the product and an up-close snap showing the product.  In the caption, Heming announced, "I am so happy to share a passion project that I have worked on over the last few years, @maketimewellness. Make Time is a wellness line for busy women. Our supplements support "Your 🧠Brain, 🧘🏽‍♀️Body, and 💋Beauty" in that order.  She further stated that part proceeds from sales would be given to a charity supporting brain health research before ending the caption with a reminder of her purpose. She remarked, "I am committed to using my voice to raise awareness for caregivers & dementia because it's through action, education, and conversation that creates change 🌈💗" During a talk with PEOPLE about the brand's purpose, the former spokesmodel for La Senza revealed that brain health is often neglected. However, her view towards brain health changed her experience with short-term memory and fogginess.  Explaining her experience, the fashion model said, "My brain was suffering, and I could feel it. Why is the focus on the rest of our body when our brain is our biggest asset and the one we should be looking after? I found that when you put your brain first and when you are taking care of your brain, your whole body benefits." According to the British model, this new project is unique to her, considering her experience and journey as a caregiver to her husband.  "For me, it's really about connecting to a community and being open and able to talk about dementia and to take away that stigma that there is no shame around it. I'm learning through the process." Before the conversation with the news outlet ended, "The British Elle Supermodel" winner shared that she had expert support.  "I can call an expert and speak to some of the most incredible doctors," Hemming said. "So I guess I have a new purpose, and I'm so excited to share what I'm learning with everyone. It's like a fire's been lit. It's my new purpose, and here I am." In March, the mom of two talked about receiving help from dementia expert Teepa Snow as she deals with her husband's ailment. While the cover girl advocates for brain health and caregivers, some fans accused her of using the "Die Hard" actor's ailment to gain the spotlight for herself. However, Heming addressed the accusations, highlighting that she won't stop speaking up.  She took to Instagram to let the world know she won't relent in her efforts for her husband. In the video posted, she was seen in a blue top with her brown curls falling to her shoulders. The former runway star opted for a makeup-free face, adding animal-print glasses.  The 44-year-old began her message by saying, "I just saw something about me getting my five minutes, which is great. Which means you're listening," the Malta native continued. "So I'm going to take my five minutes, and I'm going to turn it into ten because I'm always going to advocate for my husband." The media personality added that as long as she had a platform, she would forever create awareness about frontotemporal dementia. Also, she stated that she planned on using her presence to acknowledge caregivers, whom she praised as "unsung heroes." Willis declared that regardless of the criticism, she would not be silenced. She said, "I am going to turn my grief, anger, and sadness and do something good around something that feels less than." As for individuals who accused her of wanting the spotlight, the wife of Willis had a departing note. She said, "Watch this space because I didn't come to play."
