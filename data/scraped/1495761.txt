Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli anew stressed on Saturday the government is keen on simplifying customs release procedures for all goods at the ports with giving priority to food goods, pharmaceuticals, petroleum and fuel. Madbouliâ€™s remarks came during his inspection tour at Alexandria Port to check the customs release procedures and follow up on the process of handling containers. The prime minister pointed out that goods worth billions of dollars were released from ports to make all basic commodities available at the local markets. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Mohamed Maait, who accompanied the premier, said the shipping agencies are allowed to transfer their imported goods from ports to warehouses and dry ports to exempt investors and importers from the additional burdens of storing goods in ports.
