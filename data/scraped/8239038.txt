Hyderabad: Employees and pensioners of power utilities are eagerly awaiting an announcement on the implementation of the Pay Revision Commission (PRC) and other benefits, after their agreement with the government last month and following which they had called off their April 17 strike. The employees unions had demanded a 40-per cent hike in salaries. The managements persuaded the unions to accept seven per cent citing the poor financial position of the power utilities. The PRC was due from April 1, 2022. The power utilities managements have distributed forms to the employees to get their opinion over implementation of PRC. The power utilities have 72,000 personnel including 28,000 employees, 22,000 artisans and 20,000 pensioners. Speaking to Deccan Chronicle, TS Electricity Employees’ Joint Action Committee (TSEEJAC) convener N. Shivaji said that the seven per cent fitment, house rent allowance, service weightage and other benefits will be implemented with immediate effect. The monetary benefits will be reflected in pay slips of June, he said. Arrears from April 1, 2022, will be proportionately included in coming pay slips, he explained. On the other hand, employees of the northern discom sid they had got revised pay scales in May. “Due to the 35 per cent hike in the PRC, we hoped a hike in PRC-2022, but in vain,” said an assistant engineer from Nizamabad district.
