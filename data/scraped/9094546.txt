India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani is dominating the internet service with Reliance Jio Fiber. As per multiple reports, Ambani doesn’t favour Elon Musk’s approach of licensing the services instead of auctioning the spectrum. As things stand, a battle is on the cards between Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio and Elon Musk’s Starlink.            

Elon Musk explains why he isn’t in favour of Mukesh Ambani’s plan to auction the spectrum

According to a report in the Economic Times, Elon Musk clearly stated that if the Indian government will not accept his advice to provide a license, then it wouldn't be possible for him to enter into the Indian market with Starlink. The Tesla owner further explained how the auctioning of the spectrum would impose geographical restrictions and its direct impact will be on the price of the services. Hence, in the end, it will be the consumers who will suffer.

If the reports are to be believed, Mukesh Ambani is doing everything to make the government understand why they shouldn’t accept the demands of a foreign satellite service provider. The billionaire wants to create a level of playing field with the process of auction so that everyone can compete gracefully in the country with the second most internet users in the world. It will be interesting to see how things unfold in the coming future. However, one thing is clear, the rivalry between the world’s richest man, Elon Musk and India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, is all set to turn ablaze.

What are your thoughts on Elon Musk’s dream to enter India as an internet service provider with Starlink? Do you think Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Fiber can compete with it? Let us know.

India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani is dominating the internet service with Reliance Jio Fiber. As per multiple reports, Ambani doesn’t favour Elon Musk’s approach of licensing the services instead of auctioning the spectrum. As things stand, a battle is on the cards between Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio and Elon Musk’s Starlink.            

Elon Musk explains why he isn’t in favour of Mukesh Ambani’s plan to auction the spectrum

According to a report in the Economic Times, Elon Musk clearly stated that if the Indian government will not accept his advice to provide a license, then it wouldn't be possible for him to enter into the Indian market with Starlink. The Tesla owner further explained how the auctioning of the spectrum would impose geographical restrictions and its direct impact will be on the price of the services. Hence, in the end, it will be the consumers who will suffer.

If the reports are to be believed, Mukesh Ambani is doing everything to make the government understand why they shouldn’t accept the demands of a foreign satellite service provider. The billionaire wants to create a level of playing field with the process of auction so that everyone can compete gracefully in the country with the second most internet users in the world. It will be interesting to see how things unfold in the coming future. However, one thing is clear, the rivalry between the world’s richest man, Elon Musk and India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, is all set to turn ablaze.

What are your thoughts on Elon Musk’s dream to enter India as an internet service provider with Starlink? Do you think Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Fiber can compete with it? Let us know.
