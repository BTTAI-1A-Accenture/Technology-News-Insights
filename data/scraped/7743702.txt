 A certificate of deposit (CD) offers savers a deal: Give up your money for a set period of time in exchange for a higher interest than you might find with a savings account. In order for this to make sense, though, you need to have confidence that the bank will make good on its word by the time your CD matures.  That’s not as simple as it sounds. Four banks have collapsed in 2023, including Silicon Valley Bank, which was one of the largest bank failures of all time. Without some type of insurance, you’re not likely to recover your funds if the bank holding them fails. Enter the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which provides up to $250,000 in insurance at covered banks, which can include CDs. Before you save with a financial institution, and determine how much of your savings to fork over, make sure the bank is FDIC insured and the entirety of your savings will be covered.  The FDIC doesn’t analyze and approve each individual CD that all banks offer. Instead, each bank applies for FDIC insurance and then holds and maintains its insurance coverage.   As a saver, you receive up to $250,000 of FDIC coverage per depositor, per bank, per account ownership type. So if you have up to $250,000 at one bank, spread across your checking, savings and CD accounts, it’s all covered.   The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) offers the same level of insurance as the FDIC, but for credit unions. You can find the best credit union CDs here. That leaves an obvious gap: What if you have more than a quarter million you want to save in a CD? “[I]f your savings exceed $250,000 and you want to invest more in CDs, consider splitting your savings across different banks to maximize your coverage,” said Andrew Latham, a certified financial planner (CFP) based in Rolesville, North Carolina. For example, you could have $200,000 in a CD ladder at one bank that’s separate from your $100,000 emergency fund at another bank, that’s independent from your checking and savings account at a third bank. This way, none of your total deposits at a single bank outpace the $250,000 insurance limit.   When planning out your deposits, include a little breathing room. Any earned interest on a CD or savings account counts towards your total deposit coverage limit. You can use a CD calculator to determine the total value of the account at its maturity.  There are nearly 4,700 FDIC-insured banks in the U.S. and it’s easy to check whether a financial institution is insured. “Most banks will have their FDIC status listed right on their statements,” said Eric Croak, a certified financial planner and president of Croak Capital. “If not, you can look at the BankFind tool on the FDIC website to make sure your CD is covered.”  The NCUA provides a similar Credit Union Locator tool on its website. All else being equal, prioritize the best CD rates available, though some institutions require you to meet a certain required minimum deposit to open an account. Jumbo CDs, which typically come with a $100,000 deposit requirement, may offer higher rates in exchange for larger deposits, though you can find similar rates with standard CDs.    Most institutions offer several term lengths, so you could choose from 3-month CDs all the way up to 10-year CDs. Once the CD matures, you can either cash out your funds or roll it over into a new term.   If you’re worried about needing your money early, you could take advantage of a no-penalty CD which allows you to make an early withdrawal without paying a fee. (Typically, these CDs come with lower yields than standard CDs with similar maturities.) CD yields are at the highest levels in more than 15 years, making them an ideal tool for savers. The key is to use them in a way that maintains your financial flexibility. The simplest option is to pick a maturity that matches when you’ll need the funds. If you plan on buying a home in two years, for instance, opt for a two-year CD. Not only will you earn a good return, but by tying up your savings, you’ll be less likely to fritter it away.  You can enlist a more sophisticated CD savings strategy, such as laddering or the barbell, if you want to earn high yields but don’t have a specific purchase in mind. Both endeavors spread out your savings among different maturities, which means you’ll enjoy periodic access to your cash as well the ability to act quickly on changing interest rates. For instance, you can adjust your CD ladder if long-term rates start to rise considerably. No matter how you enlist CDs, though, you’ll still need to maintain an emergency fund, which should be placed in a high-yield savings account. While you’ll sacrifice a few points in yield, you’ll gain the ability to access your funds at any point without paying a penalty, which is the point of an emergency fund.  Likewise, CDs shouldn’t make a sizable chunk of your retirement savings, especially if you’re still working or even into early retirement. Stocks are volatile, but deliver higher yields over the long-haul.  “With low risk comes lower return potential, so you shouldn’t use a CD for long-term goals like retirement,” Croak said.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency created by Congress in order to supervise financial institutions and protect consumer deposits. It was created in the 1930s in response to the banking crisis during the Great Depression. The FDIC is poised to step in if an insured bank fails. For credit unions, the NCUA performs the same service. According to the FDIC, the agency has historically paid out within a few days of a bank failure. There are two ways you may receive your funds. “The FDIC will typically pay you the insured amount directly or transfer your CD to another insured institution,” Latham said. “Either way, your money remains protected. If your CD is transferred, make sure you understand the new terms, which might differ.”  CDs are a low-risk investment in terms of volatility, as long as your account is FDIC-insured. However, the downside is that you won’t experience huge yields, so they’re not designed for long-term financial goals. “CDs shine brightest for those prioritizing safety over high returns and looking for a short- to medium-term place to park their money,” Latham said. “If you’re uneasy with the roller-coaster ups and downs of the stock market, CDs can be your calm harbor.”
