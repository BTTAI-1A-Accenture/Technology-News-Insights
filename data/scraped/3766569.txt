 In celebration of everybody’s favourite green-themed holiday, Pikmin Bloom is ringing in St.Patrick’s day with a variety of events, some bringing in new Pikmin to catch and others bringing in new postcards to collect as well! These events have begun as of March 1st and will run until the end of the month, so there’s plenty of time to check it out! To begin with, the biggest addition to these events is surely the new Seedlings that are up for grabs, each of which will allow you to grow your very own Clover Decor Pikmin or even the super rare Four-Leaf Clover Decor Pikmin! These new Pikmin are appropriately themed for the holiday and are adorned with an adorable clover on their heads. Depending on the Seedlings you get from the new missions and challenges, you can get a variety of colours for these new themed Pikmin, but it’s all up to chance. And to grab those new Seedlings, you’ll be taking part in over 30 different Missions that will begin as of the starting time for this event. These missions are mostly deals you’ll end up doing as you play anyway, such as defeating 5 Mushrooms, planting X amount of certain coloured flowers, that sort of thing. With a list so long, it’s better to check out the full list in-game for the details. But that’s not all! From the 17th to the 31st, you’ll also encounter green Mushrooms during your walks. These are made to be destroyed by your special Clover Pikmin, and the rare Four-Leaf Clover Pikmin is especially apt at destroying them too. If you manage to win these battles, you’ll get the Gold Seedlings that are needed to grow the themed Pikmin as well, so there are plenty of different ways to grab the new event-specific little guys!
