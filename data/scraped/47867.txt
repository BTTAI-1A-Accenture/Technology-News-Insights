China's Xi Jinping expressed willingness to speak to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, the head of the EU said on Thursday after French President Emmanuel Macron urged Beijing to talk sense to Russia over the war in Ukraine.In closely watched talks, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen and Macron met with Xi in Beijing. Macron said the West must engage China to help end the crisis and prevent "spiraling" tensions that could split global powers into warring blocs.Xi, who has sought to position China as a potential mediator in the conflict but is seen by the West as favoring Russia, responded by saying he hoped Moscow and Kyiv could hold peace negotiations as soon as possible.  "It was interesting to hear that Xi reiterated his willingness to speak" to Zelensky, Von der Leyen said, calling his words "positive." Xi said a conversation could happen when the "conditions and time are right," she added.Zelensky seeks meeting with China's Xi, who is 'ready'Zelensky has repeatedly asked Xi to meet him, including after the Chinese leader visited Russia's President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last month. A French diplomatic source told Reuters that Xi was "ready" to call Zelensky."The Russian aggression in Ukraine has dealt a blow to (international) stability," Macron told Xi, standing alongside the Chinese president outside the Great Hall of the People at the start of their bilateral meeting.
