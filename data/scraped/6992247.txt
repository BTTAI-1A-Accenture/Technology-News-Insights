Sofia Richie Grainge is redefining the "just rolled out of bed" look. In the midst of a New York City heat wave, Richie Grainge stepped out in a breezy Prada nightgown with sheer waist cutouts. The romantic midi dress featured a square neckline embellished with lace and a matching hem. She accessorized the ensemble with a pair of red velvet ballet flats and a Hermès handbag in rouge. "97 in NYC = Prada night gown," Richie Grainge captioned photos of herself posing in front of a brownstone.
 Simple yet delicate, Richie Grainge's designer nightdress is certainly an elevated take on the typical sweats and oversize t-shirt many of us lounge in when we can't be bothered to change out of our pajamas. Along the bodice, the dress boasted multiple sheer cutouts adorned with delicate lace embroidery. The lacework continued along the hem of the skirt, which cinched at the waist with the help of a white bow placed at the back of the design. 
 In place of house slippers, Richie Grainge wore red velvet flats, which, paired with her vibrant accessories, provided a bold contrast to the monochrome nightdress. She completed the quiet luxury ensemble with a pair of black sunglasses, multiple bracelets, a gold anklet, and large hoop earrings. Keeping with her signature aesthetic, Richie Grainge tied the entire look together with a slicked-back, quiet luxury bun and natural makeup.   While it's unlikely Richie Grainge actually slept in the nightgown, repurposing the piece as daywear is both innovative and chic. Certainly a step up from flannel sets — and even silk pajamas — Richie Grainge's latest outfit is proof that it's OK to stay in your pajamas all day, and you don't need to tell us twice.
