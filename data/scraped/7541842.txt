Denim is a perfect blank canvas upon which anything is possible. But just like with any classic wardrobe essential, jeans trends come and go. While denim does, indeed, stand apart with the notion that a straight fit in a true-blue colorway will remain in favor, there are certainly head-turning cuts, of-the-moment silhouettes, and specific decades-old washes that cycle in and out of style. And modern touches (for example, an asymmetrical waistband, undone fly, or overly exaggerated slit) mean anything is possible.   In 2023, we're seeing a rise in popularity of the ankle crop and distressed treatments that range from unfinished hems to redone patchwork. Pleated trousers, dramatically pooling wide legs, and formfitting boot-cut flares are also everywhere, with these more standout shapes hailing from the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Meanwhile, the low rise from the early aughts isn't going anywhere, with celebrities favoring the look, particularly when completed with a visible logo brief or a strappy thong pulled high to achieve hip cleavage.   Whether you love to mix up your denim outfits with oversize knits and statement tops or keep the combination understated in a bodysuit or simple white tee, read through the following categories one by one to see the top denim trends of 2023 that you can try on for size. Or feel free to skip ahead to your desired section, and shop a range of styles for all different body types and budgets.  â€” Additional reporting by Sarah Wasilak Whether you wear yours with ornate, embellished heels; classic ballet flats; or casual sneakers, ankle-cropped jeans expose just a sliver of skin without going for a full-blown pedal-pusher moment.
