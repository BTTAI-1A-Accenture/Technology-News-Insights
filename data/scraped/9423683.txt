CREATING a space where diversity, equity and inclusion are more than just buzzwords to Google Philippines and Telus International Philippines. Although many companies are creating safe environments, let me put a spotlight on Google and Telus for their work with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and two-spirit community â€” usually termed as LGBTQIA2S+ or just LGBTQ+. Through a variety of initiatives and policies, these companies convey that their commitment to fairness and inclusion is not confined to Pride Month, but is indeed a fundamental part of their everyday work culture. In a powerful demonstration of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Google Philippines hosted its 4th Pride Conversations. Intended to provide a platform for YouTube creators to narrate their personal stories, the event emphasized the critical importance of allies and the need to establish safe spaces. Mervin Wenke, Communications and Public Affairs head of Google Philippines, affirmed Google's support for the LGBTQ+ community. Wenke quoted Juan Rajlin, treasurer of Google, on supporting LGBTQ+ communities as a "priority from the earliest days of Google, from our pioneering health care policies to our early Pride celebrations." Rajlin emphasized that Google continues "to build on that legacy every day by prioritizing intersectional LGBTQ+ advocacy across all our platforms." Ad-free access
