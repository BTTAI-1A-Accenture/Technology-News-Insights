Warwick Davis stars in an animated series titled Moley and it has been picked up by NBC’s Peacock streaming service.  The story follows an optimistic young mole (Davis) “who lives in MoleTown, a secret city buried deep under Windsor Castle in England. With his charming manner and magic book, the adventurous Moley finds himself on a new caper in each episode – and often gets himself into a pickle.” Moly will be helped by his friends which include Mona Lisa (Gemma Arterton) and Dotty (Jessica Henwick) are there to help, accompanied by Uncle Mishmosh (Stanley Tucci) and mom Mrs Mole (Julie Walters). Richard E Grant also stars in the series.  James Reatchlous, CEO of Two Daughters Entertainment said in a statement: “Moley continues to go from strength to strength across the world. I am so pleased that the stories I told to my two little girls are now being shared with children far and wide. Bringing ‘Moley’ to U.S. audiences for the first time is especially pleasing on a personal level, as the U.S. is a place close to my heart, having spent many years of my career there.” The show will launch on Peacock on July 7 with all 52 episodes in the first season dropping at once.
