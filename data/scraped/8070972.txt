  Mia, Mike, and  Baby Louis Olem of Herndon   Ollie and Mollie belonging to Lindsey (Lindz) Welsh of Alexandria, spend a week with me,  Mercia Hobson, staff reporter for the Connection. The Poms lend little paws-able help to my stories. Luckily I have a delete key.  Lindsey is my daughter. When the Poms leave,  I miss them tremendously.  Next thing I know, Lindz, my daughter, gifts me a little Pom of my own. “You need a Pom,” she says.  Oceanna, Oshi for short, is very small and exceedingly cute.    The family doggie domino effect continues. New pup Zoey coming home for the first time to Ama Hobson.      Contents of this site are © Copyright 2024 Ellington. All rights reserved.
