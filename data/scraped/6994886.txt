The convention features nine themed pavilions and more than 20 forums focusing on critical industry topics including advanced manufacturing, heterogeneous integration, compound semiconductors, automotive chips, smart manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing, semiconductor cybersecurity and talent. Entering its 28th year, the annual trade show is expected to attract more than 50,000 attendees and feature 3,000 booths and 950 exhibitors, according to organizer SEMI. "The semiconductor industry has entered a new era of opportunities for global cooperation to solve some of its greatest challenges," said Terry Tsao, president of SEMI Taiwan and SEMI chief marketing officer. "Achieving net zero carbon emissions, building the workforce of the future and ensuring supply chain resilience as the chip industry drives toward $1 trillion in annual revenue will require nothing less than a whole-industry effort." Among the forum speakers are TSMC chairman Mark Liu, ASE CEO Tien Wu, Cadence president and CEO Anirudh Devgan, Lam Research president and CEO Tim Archer, and Tokyo Electron president and CEO Toshiki Kawai, as well as analysts from Gartner, McKinsey & Company, Morgan Stanley, Mizuho Bank, the SEMI Market Intelligent Team (MIT), and TechInsights. Taiwan is projected to maintain a top position in purchases of chipmaking equipment in 2023 and 2024, according to SEMI's mid-year forecast report.
