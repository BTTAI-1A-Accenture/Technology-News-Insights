 More than 30,000 participants, including runners, walkers, wheelchairs, and even dogs will visit nearby Pittsburgh for the 15th Dick’s Sporting Goods Marathon this weekend. Events include a 5k, Toddler Trot, Kids Marathon and Dog Walk leading to Sunday’s marquee Marathon, Half Marathon and 5-Person Relay. Local weather forecasters predict perfect conditions for Sunday with sunny skies and a high of 70 degrees. While this is great weather for spectators, it’s less than ideal for those participating. A 2001-2010 Scandinavian study of runners in the world’s six major marathons has determined that optimum marathon performance happens between 44 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit. When temperatures rise into the 60s and higher, running speed decreases and withdrawal rates increase. Slower runners are affected to a greater degree since they spent more time on the course in the heat. With temperatures in the low 50s at the 7 a.m. start time, runners may have a few hours in the ideal zone and temperatures may not come close to heat advisory levels at all. But runners who plan to run specific times or those new to the marathon may set themselves up for disappointment if they don’t recognize the added burden temperature places on a running body. All runners produce excess heat. At slower paces and lower temperatures, the body does a good job dissipating that heat. But when the outdoor temperature rises above 50 degrees, heart rates elevate to increase sweating in an attempt to regulate body temperature. This leads to dehydration, reduced blood volume and pressure, lower cardiac output and premature fatigue. Much of marathon training is an effort to delay that inevitable fatigue and its result, a slower finishing time. Some of response to heat is genetic or size and age-related. Ideally, the final few weeks of spring training should include adaptation to hot weather, but our past week has been anything but summer-like. Well-trained or not, there are a few things you can do on race day to mitigate the effects of heat. Arrive at the starting line with a full tank. Dehydration is the enemy of endurance performance, so be sure to drink when thirsty during the week leading to the marathon, especially as the weather warms. And take fluids at each aid station during the race. It is possible to drink too much water. Balance that with juice or an electrolyte sports drink. Remember that alcohol can also be dehydrating and imbibe in moderation but if you’re used to a morning coffee, a cup or two on race day is fine. Dress for success. This Sunday is predicted to be mostly sunny. Dress in loose-fitting light colors to deflect the sun’s rays and in a wicking fabric that maximizes the evaporation of sweat. Wear a light-colored hat that you can douse with water or fill with ice at aid stations or from spectators for extra cooling. Asphalt and city streets soak up the sun to give runners a double whammy of heat — rays above and radiation below. Run on the shady side of the street if possible or on the side that was most recently in shade. No one likes headwinds, but wind in your face is much more cooling than a tailwind. Sunday’s prediction is for a light breeze which will aid in evaporative cooling without pushing you backward. The marathon route may be crowded, especially at the start, but try to run in your own space. You’ll take advantage of any air movement without being shielded. As always, listen to your body. Be prepared for whatever the marathon provides — that’s part of the journey. Adjust your pace based on your individual response to external conditions whatever they may be.
