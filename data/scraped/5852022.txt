This February, Loacker is launching its first Love Pickup Prediction filter on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. In partnership with PICKUP COFFEE, the Love Pickup Prediction filter will allow Instagram and Facebook users to see their love predictions just in time for Valentine’s Day with just a slight blow on a digital PICKUP drink. Whether it comes true or not is up to you—but the thrill in getting a glimpse of destiny remains. Participants who use the Love Pickup Prediction filter will also have the chance to win one of the daily Loacker x PICKUP COFFEE Heart Box prizes, which contain the perfect Valentine’s Day match—Loacker products and seven PICKUP COFFEE stubs. One grand prize winner will receive a 1-year supply of PICKUP COFFEE. The promotion runs until February 28, 2023 only. Winners will be announced on Loacker’s official social media pages. Loacker and PICKUP COFFEE will also have a Love Prediction pop-up booth at Vertis North in Quezon City from February 12-14, 2023. Although there’s no guarantee of success in one’s love life, every spin of the roulette will give participants free balloons and Loacker products. © All Rights Reserved, Newspaper Theme.
