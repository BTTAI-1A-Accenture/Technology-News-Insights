The best players to ever step foot onto a basketball court have all been recognized with various awards over the years as becoming an NBA All-Star is among the highest individual honors in the game. Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has the most All-Star appearances with 19, while Kobe Bryant and LeBron James have each made the annual showcase 18 times. James, who is expected to pass Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer, is all but a lock to earn his 19th nod this season. With only 12 roster spots available in each conference, becoming an All-Star is incredibly difficult. The odds of appearing in the game as a first-year player are even lower as there have only been 45 rookies to make it in history. The number of rookie players in the All-Star Game has dwindled drastically over the years. The last rookie to be voted an All-Star was Blake Griffin in 2011 with the Los Angeles Clippers as there have only been 10 rookies to make the game since 1985. Rookie Wire decided to take a look at every rookie to become an All-Star.
