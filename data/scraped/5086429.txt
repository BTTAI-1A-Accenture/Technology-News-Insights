  A Blackburn comedian has been revealed as the new matchday voice at Blackburn Rovers games, following the sudden death of previous PA announcer Matt Sillitoe.
 
  Lewis Costello, a stand-up comedian and co-host of the Kicking Back podcast, became the new voice of Ewood Park matchdays on September 16, with Rovers' win over Middlesbrough the perfect start to his tenure.
 
  Lewis, 30, said: “Taking on this role is a massive honour and a proud day for me, but it’s equally heart-wrenching to do so in the wake of such a tragic loss.
 
  “Matt's passion and dedication to Blackburn Rovers will forever be remembered and I can only hope that I'll be able to do him proud.
 
  “Having been a season ticket holder for as long as I can remember, switching to the announcer's booth is going to be a surreal experience, especially given the massive mark Matt left on everyone here at the club.

  “Matt was a tremendous voice for this club and his legacy will always echo in the stands, but I'm ready for the challenge, I'm proud to be here and I'll give it my absolute all.”
 
  In August it was announced that Matt, a life-long fan who had undertaken a number of roles for the club, had died aged 30.
 
  During Saturday’s EFL Championship game against Middlesborough, fans held a minute’s applause in the 30th minute to pay tribute to Matt.

  To top the poignant moment perfectly, Sam Szmodics scored the first of his two goals during the applause on the half-hour mark, with the club saying "some things are meant to be".
 
  A qualified referee, avid Lancashire County Cricket Club fan and former University of Salford student, Matt had most recently been working as a digital content producer for the globally leading gambling awareness and harm-prevention company, EPIC Risk Management
 
  In a statement on its website, the club said: “Everyone at Blackburn Rovers and Blackburn Rovers Community Trust is deeply saddened and shocked to learn of the untimely passing of our friend and colleague Matt Sillitoe, aged just 30.

  “The voice of Ewood Park for over a decade, Matt had worked in a variety of roles for the club since starting out as a camera operator for our broadcast partner, CREATV, in 2012.
 
  “The thoughts and prayers of everyone connected with the club are with Matt’s family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.”
 
  A fundraiser has also been set up in his name and all money raised be put towards Blackburn Rovers Community Trust’s Remember the Rovers dementia project.
