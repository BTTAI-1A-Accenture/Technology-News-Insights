The focus is on removing the inefficiencies present in other cryptocurrencies. The aim is to bring Nano crypto into people’s daily lives. Nano aims to perform its blockchain transactions in a much faster and more flexible way than Bitcoin. It was also designed with new data structures and other mechanisms to gain some advantages over other digital coins. The minimal block size allows the Nano to do lightweight communication, thus reducing the transaction confirmation times and making it faster. Without the traditional Proof of Work and mining, nodes use significantly less energy per transaction. It is, in that sense, a greener option than the competition. Nano uses a structure for every block, which contains all the information about the accountant at that point. Each block also includes a small, user-generated Proof of Work value, a QoS prioritization mechanism allowing the occasional user transaction to process at fast speeds.
 In this, an account can choose a representative to vote on the user’s behalf, even if the delegating account itself is offline. These accounts are configured on nodes that remain online for a significant portion of time and vote on the validity of transactions they see on the network. Advertisement This is another feature of the Nano coins which differentiates them from the competition. With no direct monetary incentive for the nodes, this creates a better future for the network’s decentralization.
