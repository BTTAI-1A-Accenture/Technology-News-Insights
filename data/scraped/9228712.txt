To ensure the medical safety of your patients, medical practitioners and the environment, you must use medical equipment safely — this includes keeping them clean and sterilized. Thorough and effective cleaning of these important equipment pieces is necessary to avoid the possibility of disease spreading from patient to patient. Here we explore how to sterilize medical equipment, including the benefits of doing so and methods and accessories used to carry out the sterilization process. With invasive procedures, there's contact between a patient's mucous membranes or sterile tissue and a surgical instrument or medical device. A significant risk of these types of procedures is introducing pathogenic microbes, potentially resulting in infection. When you don't properly disinfect or sterilize medical equipment, it increases the risk of infection due to the breach of host barriers. For both hospital staff and patients alike, germs need to be destroyed to reduce the spread of infections. A prime example of this is fighting against healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which are infections hospital patients get due to their hospital stay. Surgical instruments, contaminated equipment or improper staff hygiene can cause HAIs.
