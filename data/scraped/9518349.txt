WATCH LIVE Deputies said Shawn Dale Jordan was found pantsless after bloodhounds picked up his scent Friday evening. LIBERTY, Texas (KTRK) -- A man who broke free from the Liberty County Jail on Friday evening was placed back into custody after a brief escape. The Liberty County Sheriff's Office informed the public about Shawn Dale Jordan's escape from its detention facility, which is located at 2400 Beaumont Ave. in Liberty, Texas, on Friday evening. The sheriff's office said Jordan was on the run for an hour and 40 minutes, adding that he was able to escape after "squeezing" his way through two doors. He then allegedly got over a razor-wire fence, where he lost his pants, and bloodhounds picked up his scent. Officials said Jordan gave up and heard deputies in the area searching when he yelled out with his hands up and surrendered. Deputies first alerted the public on Facebook at 8:41 p.m. but later confirmed his capture about 36 minutes later. He was originally booked on June 30 on counts of manufacturing and delivery of a controlled substance and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, but deputies said he's now facing escape charges.
