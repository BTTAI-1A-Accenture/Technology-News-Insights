AMES – There was no shortage of sports in Chase Contreraz’s young life. He would go on to be a five-sport athlete at Missouri Valley High School, but the roots of that sports obsession started much earlier.  “My dad definitely introduced a lot of different things to me so I could choose what I wanted to do,” Contreraz said, “whether it was hitting plastic golf balls or whiffle balls. He’d come home after work and we’d play basketball or go to the football field and just hit fly balls to each other.”
