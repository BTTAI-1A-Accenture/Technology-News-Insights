Senior Director, Contact Centre at CoinSwitch                         Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in customer expectations. The rise of digitalization has propelled the importance of personalization and customized customer experiences to the forefront of achieving business success. Owing to the developments in the digital world, personalized experiences have transitioned from being a luxury to becoming an absolute necessity. Customers now expect to be treated as unique individuals; failing to meet these expectations puts companies at risk of losing their customers to competitors who prioritize personalization.
 This can be achieved by harnessing the power of data and artificial intelligence (AI), businesses can deliver highly targeted, relevant, and captivating experiences to their customers on a large scale. These technologies enable companies to offer fast, convenient, and personalized support. Furthermore, by leveraging AI, organizations can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, empowering them to make well-informed decisions regarding their customer engagement strategies (whether it will be personalized offers, services or deals).  AI-powered customer service is revolutionizing the way companies interact with their customers. Therefore, from the big banks to the FinTech’s, there’s so much investment in building AI capabilities because they know it’s a point of competitive differentiation. Companies that invest in deep learning capabilities for recommendation systems are likely to outperform their competitors in acquiring customers and delivering superior customer experience, gaining market share in the process. AI is currently the most-discussed technology across industries; so much so that the popularity does not correspond with adoption rate. In the past year alone, approximately 20% of fintech investments have been directed towards personalized financial management. Concurrently, the advent of open banking has unleashed a surge of specialized fintech companies, introducing an unprecedented array of personalized recommendation products to the market. From portfolio optimization and risk management to fraud detection, tax analysis, and even relationship management, AI will have a profound impact. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, AI can provide tailored advice and insights in these specific areas. This technology has the potential to enhance decision-making processes, improve efficiency, and uncover hidden patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed. Today, fintech companies have the ability to combine data generated within their organization with data from external sources to enhance client interactions throughout the customer journey. Consumers have different preferences regarding the way they want to interact with AWM (assets and wealth management) professionals. AI software solutions are used to identify the most effective forms of communication (email, chats, phone calls, mail, messages) for every customer, as well as favored frequency of interactions.  However, it is equally important for FinTech’s (as they are dealing with people’s money) to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used to train the machine learning algorithms and consider the ethical and regulatory implications of using these technologies.
