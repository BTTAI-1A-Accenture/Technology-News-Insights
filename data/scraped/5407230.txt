German media group ProSiebenSat.1 is to double down on entertainment investments and is eyeing acquisitions, as it puts streaming service Joyn at the center of its business. A statement released this morning outlined ProSieben’s strategic focus going forwards to address “tech challenges of the market environment and the changing media landscape,” with acquisitions playing a core part in the plan.

Discovery Deal Amazon Snaps Up 'Falco'; Euro TV Firms Set Internet Protections; Tuchman Joins NextUp - Global Briefs ProSieben’s Entertainment division operates a number of terrestrial networks, which play shows such as The Masked Singer Germany and Next Top Model, and is now the sole owner of streaming service Joyn. It also operates Dating & Video and Commerce & Ventures arms. The company’s channels reach around 60 million viewers a week in total, according to its data. According to ProSiebenSat.1 Media CEO Bert Habets, the network has “everything it takes to reach millions every day,” and noted: “In the future our investment focus will be on our entertainment business.” While a major European entertainment company investing in content and production companies isn’t exactly mind-blowing, ProSieben had been quiet on the acquisitions front for a while. In fact, it has been more focused on shopping assets, notably selling its U.S. production business to The North Road Company for $200M in July 2022. In November last year, the broadcaster restructured its production operations under a Seven.One Studios banner that bundles together German, U.S., Danish and Israeli companies, plus sales division Red Arrow Studios International. The company is regularly “reviews opportunities for acquisitions” and is also planning to to put more cash into its newsroom, local programs and “closer cooperation” with creators so it can reach more platforms. Streaming service Joyn will form the central spine of ProSieben’s digital entertainment strategy and will become “the entertainment and lifestyle brand for the whole family in the German-speaking region” of Europe, according to Habets. “To this end, ProSiebenSat.1 is also strengthening Joyn’s aggregator approach,” he added. Habets, who joined Unterföhring-based ProSiebenSat.1 in November 2022, last week suggested Germany’s public and private networks should launch a joint streamer to better compete with global streaming services. Today was his first chance to properly address how his new company was approaching the future and the strategy appears to be focused on steady progress. ProSiebenSat.1’s long-term future remains unclear. A merger with Silvio Berlusconi’s MediaForEurope (MFE) was ruled out earlier this year, though MFE has built a 29.9% stake in the German powerhouse and the pair are likely to work on joint projects together.

Michael Penix Jr. is done for the preseason, Raheem Morris said. Mike Tyson had little interest in trash-talking or insulting Jake Paul during the press conference for their Nov. 15 fight on Netflix.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others. Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck sees the company's Neutron rocket as "the last piece of the puzzle" in its ongoing quest to build out an end-to-end space company. He says it's also poised to threaten the lead Elon Musk's SpaceX has in the market. There are a lot of myths out there when it comes to washing your hair. It's time to set the record straight.
