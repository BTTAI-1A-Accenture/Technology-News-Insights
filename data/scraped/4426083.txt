Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst from Jefferies, maintained the Buy rating on Booz Allen (BAH – Research Report). The associated price target is $140.00. Sheila Kahyaoglu has given her Buy rating to Booz Allen’s stock due to a combination of factors. She highlights the company’s significant involvement in the AI (Artificial Intelligence) sector, which is a growing field with high potential for revenue generation. Booz Allen has generated approximately $500-700 million, or about 6% of its total sales, from its AI work, a figure expected to grow as the company’s AI talent base expands at a 25% annual rate. Furthermore, Booz Allen’s AI talent accounts for a substantial 7% of its workforce, exceeding the industry average and indicating a strong commitment to this sector.  Kahyaoglu also underscores the company’s active AI projects in the Defense, Intelligence, and Civil agencies, and its noteworthy AI contracts in the Department of Defense. The company’s proprietary AI software factory, aiSSEMBLE, also receives a mention for its potential to accelerate client missions and inform future solutions. Finally, she mentions the firm’s strategic partnerships with technology companies to support its AI business and its five areas of AI expertise. All these factors make Booz Allen well-positioned for the AI trend, therefore justifying a Buy rating for the stock.
