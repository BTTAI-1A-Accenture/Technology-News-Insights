Mozilla has introduced a new feature called Quarantined Domains, which allows the blocking certain add-ons on specific sites. This step addresses the potential exploitation of the add-on ecosystem by malicious actors. Starting from Firefox version 116, users will have more control over their add-on settings. If desired, the feature can be turned off by entering “about:config” in the address bar and changing the value of “extensions.quarantinedDomains.enabled” to false. This development enhances Mozilla’s ability to remotely deactivate individual extensions that may jeopardize user privacy and security. It is important to note that the warning message will appear in the Extensions popup rather than on the Extensions icon in the current implementation. Consequently, the alerts will not be displayed if an add-on is pinned to the toolbar.
