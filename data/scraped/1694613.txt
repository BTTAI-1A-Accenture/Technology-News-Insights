 Waterford ― A capsized kayaker was rescued from the Niantic River near Shawandassee Road late Tuesday afternoon. Police said the man was taken to Lawrence + Memorial Hospital for evaluation, though no injuries were reported. Police said a neighbor called 911 at 4:55 p.m. after seeing the kayak tip over. While waiting for police and Jordan Fire Department firefighters to respond, a private boater went out to assist the kayaker, who was hanging on to his overturned boat. About 20 minutes elapsed from the time of the call until first responders pulled the man out of the river, according to police. Comment threads are monitored for 48 hours after publication and then closed.
