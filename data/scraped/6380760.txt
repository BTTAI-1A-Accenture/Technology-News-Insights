Bethpage Bethpage Mediation Solutions of NY, the first full service mediation and arbitration company based in Suffolk County and serving lawyers and clients from Montauk to Manhattan, celebrated its opening at the company’s Islandia office.  Founded by attorneys Nancy Burner, Allison C. Johs, Frederick C. Johs, Michael Levine, and Hon. A. Gail Prudenti, Mediation Solutions of NY builds bridges between opposing parties in legal and business disputes to achieve results and settlements without court intervention. “The courts have experienced a tremendous backlog of cases since the Pandemic, making it more difficult for attorneys and their clients to have their cases resolved,” said Hon. A. Gail Prudenti, Founding Member and Former Chief Administrative Judge of the Courts of New York State and Dean of Hofstra Law. “Mediation helps to alleviate this backlog and allows for parties to have their cases resolved fairly and effectively.” “Litigants in Suffolk County haven’t had a local option for alternative dispute resolution,” said Frederick C. Johs, Founding Member and Principal of Lewis Johs Avallone Aviles, LLP. “We saw the need and have assembled a panel of judges and practitioners who have unmatched expertise in their fields and experience resolving cases effectively.” Mediation Solutions of NY offers services in the following practice areas: The Company provides in-person and virtual mediation and arbitration services for attorneys and their clients across Long Island and New York City, with offices in Islandia, East Hampton, Southampton Westhampton Beach and Manhattan.
