 There will be new outfits for Ayaka and Lisa in the Genshin Impact update, as the two new costume skins will show up in 3.4. Ayaka’s will be called Springbloom Missive. Lisa’s will be A Sobriquet Under Shade. While Ayaka’s will cost Primogems, Lisa’s can be earned through the Second Blooming 2023 Lantern Rite event.  The two new skins for Ayaka and Lisa are both outfits based on other areas, with the costumes inspired by the Genshin Impact regions of Fontaine and Sumeru. Ayaka’s is the Fontaine style. This marks one of the first opportunities to see how clothing from that as-yet unavailable location will look. As for Lisa, she studied at Sumeru in the past, and her outfit calls back to those times.  Here’s a closer look at both from the stream.           Prices weren’t mentioned for the Ayaka outfit. Typically, ordinary Genshin Impact skins for five-star characters that are only available for cash start out at 1,350 Genesis Crystals after launch. The price then goes up to 1,680 Genesis Crystals after the launch discount.  Genshin Impact is available for the PS4, PS5, PC, and mobile devices. The 3.4 update will arrive on January 18, 2023. The update will also add Alhaitham and Yaoyao.
