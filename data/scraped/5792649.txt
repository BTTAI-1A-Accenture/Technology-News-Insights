 FrontRow a funded EdTech startup that aimed to provide celebrity-led learning experiences, has shut down. The company's closure is a reminder of the challenges that EdTech startups face, and the importance of understanding the market before launching a product. Front Row was founded in 2020 by Ishaan Preet Singh and Shubhadit Sharma, and Mikhil Raj, raising over $17 million in funding. The company's platform allowed users to learn from celebrities and experts in a variety of fields, such as cooking, music, and fitness. However, Front Row was unable to achieve product-market fit (PMF), and it shut down last week in July 2023. The closure of Front Row is a setback for the EdTech industry, but it also provides some valuable lessons for other startups.  First, it is important to understand the market before launching a product. Front Row's target market was people who were interested in learning from celebrities, but the company's platform was not user-friendly enough to attract and retain users. Second, it is important to have a clear business model. Front Row's business model was based on charging users a monthly subscription fee. However, the company was unable to generate enough revenue to cover its costs. Finally, it is important to be patient. EdTech is a complex industry, and it takes time to build a successful business. Front Row was only in operation for four years, and it was unable to achieve profitability at that time. I can relate to the challenges that Front Row faced. I also built an EdTech startup that didn't work out well. My company, CORNERSTONES.IN and later rebranded to Skillyme.in  aimed to provide online upskilling courses to students. However, we were unable to attract enough students, and we shut down in 2020. The closure of Skillyme was a disappointment, but it also taught me some valuable lessons.  First, it is important to have a clear value proposition. What makes your product different from the competition? Why should people choose your product over the others? Second, it is important to have a strong marketing plan. How will you reach your target market? How will you generate awareness for your product? Finally, it is important to be flexible. The EdTech industry is constantly changing, and you need to be able to adapt your business model to the changing landscape. I am not saying that FrontRow didn't work on these things- but maybe they got a lot of headwinds for which they were not prepared for. The closure of Front Row is a setback, but it is also a learning experience.  By understanding the challenges that these companies faced, we can avoid making the same mistakes in our businesses. If you are an EdTech startup, here are some tips to help you avoid the same fate as FrontRow: I hope this article has been helpful.  If you feel that there is something in this article that is inappropriate or needs to be rectified, please feel free to send me a DM over LinkedIn itself and I would be more than happy to make the changes.
