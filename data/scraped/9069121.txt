Channel 2 Action News first told you back in February that Atlanta Allergy & Asthma tracked the first “high” pollen date. March 6th was the earliest date the count reached the “extremely high” range in the more than 25 years they’ve been keeping record. March 7th was the earliest day above a 3,000 count. Now, last Thursday, April 20th was the latest date that the count has been over 3,000. “They’re coming in saying, ‘I don’t remember having this many symptoms so severe.’ Itching of eyes, sneezing,” Dr. Stanley Fineman said. TRENDING STORIES: Fineman told Stouffer that this spring is unprecedented. It’s part of a trend that the practice has been documenting in medical journals. “We know because of the warming trend, and we’re seeing earlier pollen counts and higher pollen counts.” While over-the-counter medicines works for some people, Fineman says targeted treatments bring more relief. “That means they really should go and see an allergist and get evaluated and make sure they have a good treatment plan,” he said.
