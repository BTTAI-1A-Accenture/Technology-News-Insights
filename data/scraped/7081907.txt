The Eagles made a deal to bring in pass rushing specialist Robert Quinn froM the Bears in exchange for a fourth-round pick. The move simply hasn't worked out the way they had hoped. Head coach Nick Sirianni provided some insight on the role the saw for him back on Black Friday. "I see his ability to really rush the passer, and we have to continue to work to get him in in situations where he can do so. Yeah, I'm pleased with Robert, and glad he's on this team, and he adds great depth to this already really good defensive line." "I just know he's going to make a play, a big-time play on a big-time situation here real soon because we know how much talent he has a what a good player he is, Sirianni continued." NFL Network’s Tom Pelossero reported on the knee scope on Tuesday afternoon.   Pelissero added that he figures Quinn will be out at leas the next four weeks. Quinn has made little to no impact since coming over in the trade with the Bears, but the team is hopeful that he might be able to come back before the end of the season and give them something in the playoffs. He was one of the premier pass rushers in the NFL while with Chicago, coming off a 18.5-sack season and has a 102 sacks in his NFL career.
