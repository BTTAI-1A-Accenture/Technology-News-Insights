 Carla Abellana took to social media to share one of the"hardest lessons" she learned in life. On Instagram, the Kapuso star shared a video clip of herself, looking bright and beautiful as always in her yellow outfit. “One of the hardest lessons in life is to forgive someone who was never truly sorry,” she said in the video. Carla captioned her post with a light bulb emoji. In February, the actress dropped a mysterious but reassuring post on Valentine’s Day. Posting a photo set of the house she is currently having built, Carla wrote “I am okay” in the caption. She also recently posted an Instagram Reel about “a day [she’ll] never forget.” It was when news broke that she and ex-husband Tom Rodriguez had split up. Since the separation, Carla has been sharing some posts about her healing and self-love journey, which included this visual poem titled “Mahinahon.” Last April, she went on a vacation to Japan with her family. Carla played the role of Dr. Mary Ann Armstrong in "Voltes V: Legacy.”    A post shared by Carla Abellana (@carlaangeline)      —Carby Basina/JCB, GMA Integrated News
