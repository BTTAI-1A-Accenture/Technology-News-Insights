Updated: March 1, 2024 After years of deliberation as to the shifting tides in entertainment, Disney announced Disney Plus in 2017, which would bring all of the company’s brands such as Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm under one roof. It launched two years later in November 2019. Disney first signalled an intention to move into the streaming market in 2016, by acquiring a minority stake in streaming technology developer BAMTech. This became a 75 percent stake the following year. The service is part of Disney’s growing direct-to-consumer business, which also includes ESPN+, Hulu and Hotstar. Anticipation levels were certainly high for the launch, with Disney Plus the top-trending Google search term in the US in 2019. Within 24 hours the eagerly-awaited new platform had reached 10 million subscribers, though some of these had signed up pre-release.- Advertisement -Struggling with Global App Growth?Reach a wider quality audience with Zoomd’s ingenious UA technologies and services.

By April 2020, the streaming platform had reached 50 million subscribers. Disney Plus’s great strength is its content. At launch, the service offered a much smaller content library than rivals like Netflix or Amazon. It is acknowledged, however, that’s Disney’s strengths lie in quality over quantity, with Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel all developing content for the service. The Star Wars franchise, to which The Mandalorian belongs, was the first major hit for the streaming platform. The entire back catalogue of The Simpsons is also available, and Disney has pulled various TV shows and movies from Netflix and other streaming services. Marvel’s Wandavision was the second success for the streaming service, drawing in millions of new subscribers. It has had several hits since, although there have been a few stumbles, with some fans accusing it of pushing out too much content without enough quality control. Disney Plus looks to be the third-pillar for many consumers, alongside Netflix and Amazon Prime. With over 150 million subscribers as of 2022, it has scaled far faster than rival services which launched at similar times, such as HBO Max and Peacock.
