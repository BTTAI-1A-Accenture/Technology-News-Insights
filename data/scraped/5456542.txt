Joel Embiid dropped 52 on the Celtics Tuesday night on 20-25 shooting: Joel Embiid with an MVP performance tonight: 52 PTS13 REB6 AST2 BLK20/25 FG12/13 FT84.6% TS pic.twitter.com/qv12Y7AeyO ‚Äî Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnorNBA) April 5, 2023  ¬† Nikola Jokic, meantime, was out-dueled by Alperen Sengun in a 21-point road loss to the 20-60 Rockets. Joker finished with 14, 10, and four in 25 minutes while turning the ball over eight times. The Nuggets and Sixers are both 52-27 with three games to play, and Embiid jumped out to -450 to win MVP at DraftKings. So it‚Äôs pretty much over. After Joel missed the return leg in Denver, when the odds brought both guys to +115, Jokic wound up missing three straight games and Embiid took his frontrunner spot back. Embiid has played 64 games and Jokic 67, so there‚Äôs not much to separate the two in that regard. Joel is finishing strong and Jokic isn‚Äôt, so that should pretty much do it. Not even 47 voters from The Ringer can keep Joel from winning MVP. He wrapped it up Tuesday night. It‚Äôs OVER. Stuff the RAPTOR dorks in a locker. VORP your way into the bagster. ‚ÄúTHE MVP RACE IS OVER‚Äù üëÄ Doc Rivers with some HIGH PRAISE after Joel Embiid‚Äôs MVP performance tonight. üé•: @NBATV  pic.twitter.com/aZrQ5a1MJa ‚Äî Sporting News NBA (@sn_nba) April 5, 2023  21+ Gambling problem?
