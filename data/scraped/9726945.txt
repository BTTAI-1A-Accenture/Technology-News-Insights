KryptoGO Studio Addresses the Three Major Challenges of Web2 Businesses Upgrading to Web3 TAIPEI, Aug. 31, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, KryptoGO announces the launch of its new AI-powered cloud solution for diverse Web3 enterprise scenarios - KryptoGO Studio (hereinafter referred to as KG Studio). The solution offers a one-stop, secure, and compliant peer-to-peer marketplace application. It addresses the three key challenges faced by global Web2 businesses entering the Web3 domain: identity interoperability, technical security, and user experience, by providing intelligent solutions.      KryptoGO is one of the few industry players that drive innovation with a core focus on regulatory technology. Having gained support from the National Development Fund and launched a cross-chain wallet last year, the company is now upgrading its brand services to accelerate enterprise enablement. With KG Studio, KryptoGO aims to provide the customer journey and user experience required for entry into the Web3 market. The enterprise-level application offers rapid, secure multi-chain wallets, compliance technology, encrypted financial management, innovative NFT marketing tools, user management, and intelligent analytics. All these features aim to empower businesses to succeed in the era of Web3+AI. Founder and CEO Kordan Ou stated: "Utilizing AI can accelerate the resolution of the pain points Web2 businesses encounter when entering the Web3 realm, serving as a powerful tool. KG Studio is not just a technical solution but also a strategic partner. It helps businesses take the lead in entering the Web3 era, reducing costs and accelerating market entry. The platform offers a user-centric design, robust security and privacy measures, and flexible cryptocurrency fund management, ensuring businesses maintain a competitive edge in the rapidly evolving Web3 world." AI-Enabled Solutions for Overcoming the Challenges of Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 During the launch event, KryptoGO identified three significant challenges that have deterred Web2 businesses from entering the Web3 domain: First, the issue of identity and data interoperability between Web3 on-chain and Web2 off-chain, a problem KryptoGO has been addressing through its KYC/AML compliant technology. Second, the high technical barriers around cryptocurrency management for Web2 businesses interested in transitioning to Web3. Third, the necessity for a better user experience in Web3 compared to Web2, which sets higher challenges for brand owners facing user retention and acquisition. These challenges have held back some Web2 businesses from entering the Web3 metaverse. Kordan Ou believes that AI and the applications based on large language models (AIGC) are accelerating the digital transformation of all enterprises. The fusion of AI and blockchain grants new generational capabilities to various applications, leveraging unprecedented productivity growth brought by AI while combining the security and transparency provided by blockchain. This synthesis can offer stronger efficiency, trust, and management across different industries, from traditional financial investment and cross-border payment CeFi and DeFi applications to various GameFi scenarios based on game ecosystems, IP, P2E, social, NFT, etc. According to data from Emergen Research, the global Web 3.0 market reached $3.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow rapidly, possibly reaching $81.5 billion by 2030. The rapid growth is mainly due to advancements in AI and blockchain technologies, increased usage of cryptocurrencies, and a demand for more secure transaction methods across various industries. By 2030, the market combining blockchain and AI could reach $9.807 billion. Companies pioneering new business models using these two technologies have the opportunity for rapid growth. Primarily in technological transformation, AI accelerates learning and adaptation to new blockchain technologies, aiding developers in quickly mastering the required knowledge. In the security domain, AI can identify abnormal transaction patterns and potential security risks, enhancing the security of blockchain systems. In compliance, AI can automatically verify identities and data, reducing human errors and non-compliance, particularly important under blockchain industry regulations. Additionally, AI can analyze large volumes of data, provide insights, and assist operators in adjusting business models to align better with market demands. KG Studio's Five Key Features Addressing Three Major Challenges in Enterprise Transformation and Upgradation KryptoGO is taking the lead in launching this one-stop service against such trends. KG Studio has formulated five major modules for front-end, middle-end, and back-end enterprise scenarios. The application of AI runs through each service, resolving the longstanding three major challenges and pain points. These modules and features include: Bundled Solutions for GameFi and DeFi KryptoGO introduces bundled solutions for both GameFi and DeFi industries. The KG Studio Lite offers a lightweight, modular design for rapid deployment, aiding businesses in quickly setting up branded wallets, NFT activities, customer management, and providing visual data reporting. KG Studio Pro offers a comprehensive one-stop solution from customer journey to internal operations, including custom solutions based on diverse client needs. Brand Upgrade and Comprehensive Empowerment KryptoGO's Founder and CEO stated: "KryptoGO has gained deep insights into the challenges faced in entering the Web3 space from long-term mutual growth with Taiwan and global users. Supported by national development and venture funds, we actively collaborate with industry partners, associations, governments, and regulatory bodies to drive innovation in compliance technology and AI research.
