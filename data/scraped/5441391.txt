Android Headlines / Tech News / The DoNotPay app will help you battle liticaphobia by using AI If you are afraid of facing a judge in court or can’t hire a lawyer, the DoNotPay app can help you. This app will show off its ability in court next month in a case to challenge a speeding ticket. But how will a smartphone app help anyone in a law court? Well, just like ChatGPT, this app, DoNotPay, utilizes the power of AI in its services. This app concerns itself with issues relating to the courthouse. According to its developers, this app will defend its user in the courthouse. Surprisingly, there is a wide range of cases for which this app claims that it can step in as a lawyer. Netizens need to brace up, as the power of artificial intelligence will be making its way to the courthouse very soon. Let’s now take a closer look at this jaw-dropping smartphone app. The idea of using artificial intelligence in the courtroom might sound like a joke to most people. But, it is clear how well the ChatGPT system can answer random questions. This shows that artificial intelligence can take on certain tasks with proper training. But a courtroom is a different ball game, standing before a judge will need a meticulous thinker who is well versed with the law. The founder of the DoNotPay app Joshua Browder says that his platform has been trained in various court cases. It is also good to understand that this app only states facts concerning the topic at hand. It does stand in as an actual lawyer to win the case, as the defendant will do all the talking. The app will not react to all statements in court. Instead, the app will listen to the court proceeding and offer advice on responses the defendant will give the judge. The app’s website claims it can handle various cases, which you can find here. But, is it legal to have the proceedings of a court case recorded or listened to through a device? In most countries, it is illegal to record a court proceeding or get advice from an app during a proceeding. This moved the DoNotPay app founder to say that his app “is technically within the rules,” but not “in the spirit of the rules.” Also, Joshua Browder’s company is urging people to put this app to use for their court cases. The company also offers to pay $1 million to anyone that uses the app for their Supreme court hearing. Also, if there are any fines attracted for using the app during a court hearing, the company promises to pay. Now, these are big promises, but is it worth the risk? Some legal practitioners have also come out to disapprove of using the DoNotPay app in court. So if you wish to use this app in court, it will be good to first check with the judge. More information on this app and its performance in court will be available after it shows off its abilities in court sometime next month. Copyright ©2023 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
