We remain very optimistic and excited about the long-term growth of our B2B APAR business, and we expect it to outpace the total revenue growth in 2023. And accelerate throughout the year. The opportunity for us is different than our marketplace payouts opportunity because we are penetrating into the $5 trillion space that’s really dominated by legacy banks and checks and wires and bringing our innovative solutions to the market broadly. I’ll be in Argentina next week which is our fastest — Latin America is our fastest-growing region, and we’re seeing terrific B2B APRR growth in Latin America. So this is a global product with a global opportunity serving customers that are in just about every industry we could all think of broad industry coverage, broad global coverage competing against legacy providers and what I would describe as analog solutions, we feel well positioned to grow that business well for the year ahead. Trevor Williams: Okay. Great. Thanks again. Operator: The next question comes from Chris Kennedy of William Blair. Your line is now open. Chris Kennedy: Yeah. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. John, thanks for all the details on the customers. Can you provide a little bit more color on how many active customers you guys have on your platform or any more details on that? John Caplan: Hey, Chris, good to hear from you, and thanks for the question. We are not sharing a specific customer count number today. We are working through all the best ways to communicate the breadth of the customers we serve, the number of active customers, and we are planning to do so in the future. Not all customers are created equal, right? And I think that’s important, the very small customer who comes to Payoneer, who aspires one day to be a freelancer is drastically different than the BPO that’s working in the Philippines or the team of engineers in Ukraine or the e-commerce goods merchant that’s selling their products on the biggest marketplaces around the globe. Our focus, profitable customer acquisition, the teams are tooled to do that. We are working to make an even greater portion of the total customer book profitable through pricing, through experiments with fees, with looking at tiered service levels, and the work the team is doing on the next generation of our platform will enable us to serve an even greater percentage of the total applicants are eager for the global account that we have. Bea Ordonez: I just Chris look question and one of the key priorities for me and the whole finance organization is really continuing to build on the great work that’s already been done and building out that data and those insights that are really going to allow us to really look at our unit economics and do a very fulsome cobalt analysis and answer all of these questions and provide that enhanced disclosure that we know that you and the market more generally are looking for. So we’re definitely sort of very focused on that and deepening our understanding of unit economics across our business and we want to just be very, very thoughtful in how we scale out that disclosure. But it is not that it is an area of priority for me and for the team more broadly. Chris Kennedy: Great, very helpful. And then just real quickly on the guidance, significant margin expansion that’s kind of different from what you guys were talking about on the last quarter call, I think you were talking about modest margin expansion, I assume it’s all about float revenue, but if you could just talk about that? Thanks for taking the questions.
