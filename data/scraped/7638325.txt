 An inside look at Netlify‚Äôs mission to prevent phishing¬† By Mark Dorsi, CISO, Netlify¬† Recently, Netlify‚Äôs security team accomplished something that had been a nagging priority for me since about two weeks into my tenure as CISO ‚Äî we took our entire workforce passwordless.¬† At the time, I shared a few thoughts on the journey, and the significance of such a hard won milestone. And while plenty of congratulations were most certainly due, I wanted to provide an under-the-hood look at how we went passwordless, why we did it and what it took to actually implement company-wide. We‚Äôll cover this in a couple of parts ‚Äî first, the how and why behind the foundational work it took to allow us to go passwordless. In a subsequent blog, we‚Äôll discuss the implementation in more detail with the driving force behind our move to passwordless, my colleague Liz Shields.¬† But first, let‚Äôs back up to Day 16 on the job at Netlify, when our mission to prevent phishing began in earnest.¬† Why implement FIDO2 now?¬† When I took over as CISO, it became immediately apparent that phishing posed perhaps the greatest threat to our internal security posture. We weren‚Äôt alone, either. Of the 400 breaches reported industry-wide through the first half of 2022, more than 20 percent resulted from social engineering attacks. Our industry was under siege, and at Netlify our primary defense against phishing was employee training and Totp 2FA. But the data showed that employee training efforts simply hadn‚Äôt improved our overall click rate, and that our two-factor authentication mechanisms were all susceptible to phishing. While we hadn‚Äôt been breached via phishing ourselves, we had noticed a significant increase in phishing attempts. The one to two a week we were already experiencing was alarming enough, but the number steadily increased to the point where more than 30 percent of our employees had received a smish, phish or vish attempt within a 90 day period. Combined with industry average click rates, we had an impending disaster on our hands. Our FIDO2 journey began immediately.¬† What is FIDO2?¬† FIDO2 is a method of authentication that requires something you have in your possession versus something you know. This can be a Yubikey that authenticates your device, but it can also be a biometric form factor like FaceID or a fingerprint. It‚Äôs a piece of technology most people unknowingly interact with daily on their smartphones and personal laptops. Simply deploying FIDO2, however, does not equate to going fully passwordless. Rather, it is a foundational step in the process and one that we needed buy-in from our leadership team to undertake.¬†¬† Making the case for passwordless FIDO2 phishing defense at Netlify¬† Before we tackled such a lofty project, I wanted to be sure a) that we understood the size and scope of the issue we faced; b) that we were diligent in our use of industry data to help put that scope into context; and c) that we used this data to properly quantify the risk mitigated by solving for the problem.¬† To determine the size and scope of the issue, we first reviewed data from the previous year‚Äôs worth of phishing click rates. We found that our revamped phishing-specific employee training had failed to improve our click rate. In most cases, it stayed flat. An in depth analysis showed that this was¬† due to new hires and their susceptibility to being phished. Based on the numbers, we came to the conclusion that it would be immediately valuable if we could establish even 80 percent coverage with FIDO2 within six weeks with a concentrated focus on all new hires.¬† From there, we reviewed industry data to determine that 17 percent of costs associated with a breach can be directly attributed to phishing. In 2022, according to the Verizon DBIR,¬† that added up to an organizational average of $4.65M in lost productivity, fines, revenue and business disruption caused by phishing alone. Taking the industry data and our own internal controls into account, we concluded that we carried a non-trivial amount of risk associated with phishing. Based on the fleet we had deployed at the time, we found that more than 90 percent could support FIDO2 out of the box ‚Äî thus allowing us to achieve the coverage requirement of 80 percent. With the numbers in hand, I made the case for FIDO2 to management. Though we would need to replace an aging portion of our fleet and acquire Yubikeys for some employees, the overall cost to the business came in at under $40K ‚Äî a drop in the bucket compared to $4.65M risk exposure.¬† FIDO2 deployment to the organization¬† The very next day, we launched our ‚ÄúSquash phishing at Netlify‚Äù campaign ‚Äî a six week effort to get 80 percent of our workforce set up with FIDO2 enabled devices. Within hours of launching the campaign, 10 percent of employees had registered. Those early adopters were critical to our eventual success. It was a large enough sample size to provide some key learnings and illuminate unforeseen issues. Bringing those to the forefront early allowed us ample time to work out the kinks before FIDO2 was adopted at scale across the organization. We‚Äôll talk about the specifics of those efforts in more detail with Liz next week. To drive participation across the company, we used a dedicated Slack channel to make frequent announcements encouraging employees to register a FIDO2 device. Once they had a FIDO 2 device registered folks were permitted to leave the channel. Four weeks in, about 70 percent of the company had registered a FIDO2 device. In parallel, we began shipping out Yubikeys and device refreshes to those who required them. Within six weeks, more than 80 percent of employees had registered a FIDO2 device. Today, everyone at Netlify is required to have a FIDO2 device for accessing services and systems, ensuring that customer data is kept safe and secure.¬† Unifying the industry through shared learning The factors that drove our passwordless initiative are not unique to Netlify by any means. The challenges we faced are faced by many, and it‚Äôs my hope that this detailed look into our journey will help provide a roadmap ‚Äî or at least a starting point ‚Äî for others who find themselves in the same boat.¬† The sharing of information between teams that otherwise sit on separate sides of an imaginary fence is crucial. It promotes collaboration, improves efficiency, fosters innovation and leads to better decision making. When that information is shared quickly, it can lead to exponential improvements. Teams learn from each other, adapt to change and can implement new ideas with confidence knowing that they have been vetted by others like them. This, in turn, raises the collective bar for our industry at a faster pace, allowing us to become one, unified security team at scale and speed. Tune back in next week, as Liz Shields gives a step-by-step walk through of how we deployed FIDO2 organization-wide and ultimately took our entire workforce passwordless. Special thanks to Devdatta Akhawe and the path his team blazed on this topic. One team! Head of Customer Success and Solution Engineering at Normalyze When humans are the attack surface, there will never be peace of mind.
