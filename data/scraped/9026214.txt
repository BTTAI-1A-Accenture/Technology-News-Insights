The title for the fastest Soapbox went to G.S. Construct with their speedy trike that clocked an impressive 25.99 seconds to complete the course Bideford High Street became a racetrack for all manner of crazy creations at the annual Soapbox Derby this weekend, watched by thousands of people in person and live online. 50 teams took part in the fun-filled event which saw them hurtling down Bideford High Steet navigating ramps, chicanes and the notorious ‘dead man’s corner’, in their soapbox contraptions.  The title for the fastest Soapbox went to G.S. Construct with their speedy trike that clocked an impressive 25.99 seconds to complete the course. A. W. Hockin’s noisy lorry finished second in 26.22 seconds with West End Precision narrowly in third place at 26.64 seconds.  Rebecca Edwards, event organiser from Out of This World Events, said: “We are delighted with how the day went and how much money was raised for Chemohero. This was the third year we have done this and each year it gets bigger and better with more teams involved and more spectators cheering them on. We were blown away by the effort that went into each and every soapbox, we were in awe of some of the builds and the imagination and skill involved. We had a few epic wipe outs, some didn’t survive the course and we had a couple carry their builds to the finish line; the spirit of the teams was just marvellous. We are already looking forward to next year’s event!”  The best presented Soapbox award winners were Bee Gees with their bee inspired build, Back to the Factory from Pall Corporation with their take on the classic DeLorean and the Empire Rides Back with a Star Wars themed craft.  The day turned out to be a huge success, with organisers paying particular thanks to the 70 volunteers who helped throughout the day to make it possible, by making the course, marshalling the event and then leading the massive tidy up operation.  “We are so grateful for all our volunteers, we couldn’t do it without them,’ adds Rebecca. ‘Special thanks to Exmoor Hay and Straw for the bales that made up the course, to Devon Audio and the Voice Radio for our comperes and sound system and to Seth Conway Media for livestreaming the event on the big screens and on Facebook so that people could watch live’.  Peak Online’s double entry of Black Pearl and the Bath of Beans raised the most money for Chemohero at £4791.52. The final fundraising total from all 50 teams will come in later this week but it’s hoped the event will have raised at least £18,000 for the North Devon charity that supports people starting chemotherapy treatment at The North Devon District Hospital.  Their boxes of kindness include nearly 40 products for the patient to use while on treatment. This includes products to help with the side effects of the therapy as well as some treats for the patient to enjoy at a time of uncertainty.
