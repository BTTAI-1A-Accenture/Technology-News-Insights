Science Talent 2023 Young researchers are put forth for this award by universities and knowledge institutions. The election aims to provide a platform for the research of young scientists. “The world is on the brink of numerous highly complex global challenges, and more than ever, we need science to guide us forward,” says Jim Jansen, Editor-in-Chief of New Scientist. “Whether it’s new insights in climate, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, or lab-grown meat; research in these areas is indispensable.” This year, 15 scientists were selected from this pool, and the public can cast their votes. After the public voting phase, which runs from August 16 to September 15, a panel of judges will assess the five candidates with the most votes. The winner will be announced on 7 and 8 October.
