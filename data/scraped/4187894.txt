Being injured by a moving object (e.g. being struck by a falling objectÂ or a cut from a hand knife) accounts for over 10% of majorÂ injuries reported to HSE in the food and drink industries. This is the third largest category of reported injuries after manual handling and slips. The total number of injuries from this cause is around 700 per year of which about 100 are major injuries. A third of the injuries are caused by falling objects (eg an item
 falling from a storage rack), a quarter are from hand tools
 (especially hand knives) with the third highest cause being hit by
 moving pallet trucks etc..  Work area risk assessments should include looking at this particular risk, 
      especially as 'struck by' injuries are common and are likely to 
      occur almost anywhere.
