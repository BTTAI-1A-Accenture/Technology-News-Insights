Monday, August 19, 2024 Seapower Official Publication of the Navy League of the United States  Release from Program Executive Office Land Systems  *****  July 26, 2023  By PEO Land Systems   Camden, Arkansas — The Program Executive Officer Land Systems, Ground Based Air Defense Program Manager recently visited Camden, Arkansas, to discuss the possibility of producing the Iron Dome Tamir missile and future Americanized version known as Sky Hunter for the Medium Range Intercept Capability program. The discussions, held July 19, included representation from Raytheon, Rafael and Raytheon Rafael Systems better known as R2S. During the discussions, R2S detailed the concept of the production facility and provided a tour of the potential site.    “This will be a great thing for the Medium Range Intercept Capability program and for the USMC, if this occurs,” said PM GBAD Don Kelley. The production of the Tamir/Sky Hunter within the United States not only will provide American built Sky Hunters, but a possible second source of Tamir missiles for the Israeli Missile Defense Organization.   Since 2018, the Marine Corps GBAD Program Office has been developing MRIC to counter cruise missile threats. The system includes the Common Aviation Command-and-Control System and a mini–Battle Management Control system for the Tamir missile, along with the AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar.  MRIC completed a series of successful live-fire tests in September 2022. The Milestone Decision Authority met in December 2022 and provided authorization to conduct the certification process, with the first platoon made ready to deploy in fiscal year 2025.  A follow on decision by the Marine Corps would potentially procure up to three batteries between fiscal 2025 – 2027.   Seapower
