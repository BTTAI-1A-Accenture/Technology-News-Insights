AI, or artificial intelligence, is technology that attempts to simulate human cognitive function. AI has made its way into the software development space in a number of ways. Visit the AI article list to expand your AI knowledge. Learn More Observability is a way for development teams in an organization to view their program state. Failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures. Read about the latest observability content here Learn More In the past, the CI/CD pipeline was simply a place to integrate code. Developers would write their code in GitHub, pass it through the pipeline, and then deploy it. The pipeline has become a much more critical piece of the software delivery lifecycle today. Learn More Modern cloud-native applications, often leverage microservices, containers, APIs, infrastructure-as-code and more to enable speed in app development and deployment Learn More Sponsored By: Always On, Always Fast Deploy Distributed PostgreSQL in just 90 Seconds Learn More  The Importance of Security Testing With more development teams today using open-source and third-party components to build out their applications, the biggest area of concern for security teams has become the API. This is where vulnerabilities are likely to arise, as keeping on top of updating those interfaces has lagged. Read the Guide Here Mobile App Testing involves analyzing mobile apps for functionality, usability, visual appeal, and consistency across multiple mobile devices. It helps ensure an optimal user experience, irrespective of the device used to access the app. Learn More Today’s distributed software environments incorporate a variety of APIs with every interface your software touches, from mobile to microservices. Each API has to be continuously tested and verified to ensure your software functions as it should. Parasoft’s API testing platform makes quick, efficient, and intelligent work of such requirements. Learn More Ensure your application’s resilience, and make sure your software performs as expected under diverse operating conditions. (sponsored by Parasoft) Learn More    DevSecOps is the DevOps community’s approach to bringing security into the development lifecycle. Businesses want to deliver software, but cannot afford to release unreliable or insecure applications— therefore security needs to be baked in much sooner than it has traditionally been. Learn More Securing an application is just as important as building it in the first place. As data becomes more valuable, there are more people who want to steal it and use it for their own personal gain. Making sure applications are indeed secure has always been a challenge, as hackers try to stay one step ahead of defenders. Learn More Secrets are essential for integrating your infrastructure with databases and SaaS services. Doppler‘s developer-first security platform empowers teams to manage, orchestrate, and govern secrets across any environment. In 2023, there was an 18% decline in the number of open-source projects that are considered to be “actively maintained.” This is according to Sonatype’s Annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report. Learn More Development Managers need a different type of content than developers… They need to know what platforms, tools, trends, and issues they should be thinking about. SD Times delivers those unique topics here Learn More Agile software development has been around since the 1990s, but didn’t get the name until the famous meeting of 17 renowned software development thought leaders at Snowbird, Utah resulted in an Agile Manifesto. The idea behind Agile software development is to reduce time to market by enabling faster iterations of smaller segments of software. Learn More Value stream management involves people in the organization to examine workflows and other processes to ensure they are deriving the maximum value from their efforts while eliminating waste — of resources, time and assets. It is the practice that truly brings the business side and IT side together as partners in creating value for the organization. Learn More Learn More DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. Learn More Gravitee helps organizations manage and secure their entire API lifecycle with solutions for API design, management, security, productization, real-time observability, and more.

Learn More XBRL, the extensible business reporting language, was conceived for financial reporting. But Altova’s CEO Alexander Falk said he’s seeing an evolution in the European Union, where banking regulators now want to see more than quarterly or monthly financials: They want to see transaction-level data to ensure that an institution is stable. To help with the faster processing of XML and XBRL data, Altova, an XML tool company, last week announced RaptorXML, a full processing and validation server that has been optimized for parallel architectures, Falk said. The product will ship in the next few weeks, he added. XBRL, he said, “requires a meeting of the minds of technical people and accounting people.” XML usually requires some technical knowledge, and as XBRL formulas are expressed in XML, it has been beyond the capabilities of most business people. To make it easier for businesspeople to create XBRL formulas, he said the Bank of Spain recently created a UI prototype that enables businesspeople to create formulas by pointing and clicking on cells in an interface that looks like a spreadsheet.  Since RaptorXML can process documents in parallel, Falk sees a future use for it in the realm of Big Data. “The transaction-level data views give regulators deeper insights into the stability of banks. But switch from [profit-and-loss] statements to transaction level, and XML documents quickly balloon from megabytes to gigabytes,” he said. “Add to this the monitoring of multiple banks, and now you are very quickly in terabyte space, and the speed of validations comes into the discussion,” he continued. “Then, regulators are going to have to store the data after they validate it, and now you’re into Big Data. You might go to a Hadoop solution to store” the data and to run Map/Reduce functions against it, he said, noting that Hadoop integration with RaptorXML is something Altova is looking at. RaptorXML can run across Linux (64-bit), Mac OS (64-bit) and Windows (32- and 64-bit) platforms, and features ultra-high performance code optimizations, according to the company. It also has a low memory footprint and can stream instance validation against Document Type Definitions and XML Schema Definitions, the company announced. The server will be available for purchase in May.
