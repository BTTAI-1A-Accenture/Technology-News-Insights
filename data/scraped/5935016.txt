Q-commerce partnership revolutionises online retail experience ONLINE food and grocery delivery platform Foodpanda Malaysia has partnered with retail giant Aeon Co (M) Bhd to allow seamless shopping for customers. Foodpanda’s quick commerce (q-commerce) ecosystem allows the purchase of nearly 13,000 items from 30 stores. Customers can shop at eight Aeon MaxValu supermarkets, 10 Aeon Wellness outlets and 12 Daiso outlets on the app at affordable in-store prices with delivery within 30 minutes to their doorstep. Aeon has plans to add more Aeon Wellness and Daiso outlets on the app. With a mobile broadband penetration rate of 132% and a 10.4% year-on-year growth in ecommerce receipts in the first quarter of 2023, online shopping has become an integral part of Malaysian life. Aeon made its debut on Foodpanda in April, and by August its revenue had grown more than fivefold. During the same period, the average basket size of Aeon customers on the platform increased by over 30%. With a 39% influx of new-to-brand customers, Aeon’s partnership with Foodpanda Malaysia reflects a strong local preference for a comprehensive online shopping experience. In a statement, Foodpanda q-commerce vice-president Raphael Zennou said the collaboration with Aeon was a major milestone in the pursuit of delivering a holistic, on-demand shopping experience for customers. Launch guests pitting their shopping skills against each other to mark the collaboration between Aeon and Foodpanda. “The partnership is a natural extension of Foodpanda’s existing grocery offerings. “Customers can access a wide range of products at their fingertips through Foodpanda shops, with almost 7,000 other outlets and a total of 4.7 million types of inventory for fast deliveries of household necessities,” he said. This partnership now allows Malaysians to enjoy flexible grocery shopping through Foodpanda, offering options for pre-ordering, selecting delivery times and receiving personalised recommendations based on their preferences. Aeon deputy managing director and chief operating officer Naoya Okada said Aeon’s presence in Malaysia over the past 39 years had made a mark on Malaysians. “It is one of their preferred retailers that has provided consistent and affordable prices for quality fresh goods year-round while understanding evolving consumer demands,” he said. Okada said the partnership was also testament to Aeon’s growing potential in the country. “At present, Aeon has 2.47 million Aeon members. “We look forward to tapping into Foodpanda’s extensive customer base to provide Malaysians with seamless, time-saving shopping experiences, all while delivering our promise of price-matching guarantees in both the Foodpanda app and in-store,” he added. To celebrate this strategic partnership, Aeon hosted a media launch at Evo Mall Bangi, which houses Aeon MaxValu, Aeon Wellness and Daiso outlets. Attendees participated in a supermarket sweep game utilising the app to order specific products but were also tasked with searching for the items in the supermarket aisles themselves. A total of 160 traditional Japanese lucky bags known as fukubukuro are available this week for purchases made under Foodpanda picks on the app. Each bag contains a random assortment of goods from Aeon MaxValu and Aeon Wellness at RM25 per bag.
