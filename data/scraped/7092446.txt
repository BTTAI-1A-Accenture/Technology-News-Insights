Lineage Logistics bought eight cold storage warehouses from Burris Logistics for an undisclosed sum, the buyer said.
                

Novi, Mich.-based Lineage previously bought Lyndhurst, Va., and Haines City, Fla., facilities from Burris in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
                

Integrating the eight facilities into Lineage’s network will add nearly 1.3 million square feet of capacity and around 115,000 pallet positions, the company said Oct. 3.
      	    






The facilities are located in Lakeland and Jacksonville, Fla.; McDonough, Ga.; Edmond, Okla.; New Castle, Del.; Waukesha, Wis.; and Federalsburg, Md.

Lineage said the facilities it bought are located near major highways and transportation hubs, and will serve densely populated markets to help the company’s direct-to-consumer fulfillment operation reach all 50 states.
                

Lineage ranks No. 23 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest logistics companies in North America, while Burris ranks No. 35. Lineage is No. 1 on the list of top refrigerated firms, with Burris at No. 4.
                

“This deal represents the trust we have built and the track record we have delivered across our long-standing relationship with Burris, which is demonstrative of Lineage being the industry’s acquirer of choice,” said Greg Lehmkuhl, Lineage CEO.
                

“As with our previous acquisitions from Burris, these complementary locations and their supremely dedicated team members will further fuel Lineage’s fierce customer-driven approach and serve our vision to become the world’s most dynamic temperature-controlled logistics company,” he added.
                

Following the deal, Burris’ remaining portfolio will primarily consist of Honor Foods, a food service redistribution company, and Trinity Logistics, its freight brokerage arm. Burris acquired Trinity in 2020. Trinity ranks No. 17 on TT’s list of the top freight brokerage firms.
