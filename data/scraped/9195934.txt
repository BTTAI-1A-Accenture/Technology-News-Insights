 Asset management software is a tool that helps organizations track and manage their assets throughout the entire asset life cycle, from acquisition to disposal. There are several types of asset management software that can be used for managing a variety of assets, including physical assets, IT assets, digital assets and real estate assets. Organizations use asset management software to track asset costs and usage, manage maintenance, track repairs, monitor asset location, analyze asset performance and ensure compliance with regulations, such as software license usage. Using asset management software is an efficient and effective way to streamline asset acquisition and usage processes, which improves productivity, reduces costs and can extend the return on investment (ROI) your organization nets from its assets.

The software provider should give you a detailed list of system requirements necessary to run the software.

For example, consider whether your IT team will be responsible for software installation and updates or whether that is handled through the provider. Also, make sure you understand where the software will be hosted—on a web server or cloud-based—and who will be hosting the software—your company or the software provider. Finally, asset management software should provide extensive security features to protect your assets and sensitive data from unauthorized access, loss or corruption. Top security features include secure data encryption, two-factor authentication, firewalls and intrusion detection, secure data backups, and regular security updates and patches.

Asset management system costs typically vary based on the number and type of assets you need to manage. Costs widely range from around $20 to over $1,000 per month. Some asset management providers also factor in the number of users allowed when pricing their solutions. For example, with GoCodes, you pay $500 annually for three user logins and up to 200 assets but will pay $2,500 annually if you need to manage 2,000 assets and require 20 user logins. Many top asset management solution providers, including Asset Panda and Ivanti, will provide a custom quote based on your unique needs; this can be especially beneficial if you need a solution that will easily scale with you as your needs change.

Many asset tracking solutions come with complicated pricing plans based on the volume of assets tracked and the number of software users. Tiered pricing can make it challenging to determine which solution is best based on the features and services offered.

Factors that included customer support played a key role in this ranking. Even the best software requires intervention or explanation from support specialists, which is why we looked at the various methods of support offered as well as support hours for every solution we reviewed. To gain this information, we looked at what real users of the software providers thought about them based on reviews left on third-party review websites G2 and Trustpilot, especially those reviews where the provider scored at least a 3.5 out of 5 in the review.

It depends on how many physical assets you have to manage and how many people need access to that asset tracking software. quick response (QR) codes, barcode scanning, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tracking and GPS systems are common for a variety of businesses. Keeping track of multiple business assets can be difficult, especially when assets climb into the hundreds or thousands. Asset management software provides a centralized location for keeping track of crucial information about your company’s assets, including who is authorized for access, asset purchase date, asset costs, service and maintenance records, usage patterns and asset location. The more assets your company manages, the more likely you need an asset management software solution. Asset value is another consideration; the higher an asset’s value, the more likely you need a tool for managing its usage, location and other critical asset parameters. Without an effective asset management solution, you risk losing more assets to theft, purchasing duplicate assets that aren’t necessary and incurring more downtime as maintenance and service needs may not be adequately tracked. You also lose out on the opportunity to pinpoint asset under-usage, leaving you at risk for renewing costly, unnecessary asset leases. An asset management tool is your asset tracking software where you can keep track of all of your important physical assets in one place. Asset tracking helps businesses improve their operations and cut down on administrative redundancies.
