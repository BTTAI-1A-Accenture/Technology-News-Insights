Heartland Value Fund made the following comment about Stewart Information Services Corporation (NYSE:STC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter: “Financials. With a 10% market share, Stewart Information Services Corporation (NYSE:STC) is the smallest of the four companies enjoying an oligopoly in the title insurance industry. While most people don’t think about title insurance when purchasing a home, policies indemnify homeowners and lenders against title defects that could result in significant loss arising from back taxes, liens, and other claims. Ever since a proposed sale to larger peer First American Financial was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 2019, STC has been in need of a new direction. Since being named CEO that same year, Fred Eppinger has set out to improve the company’s margin structure and take market share. These operational improvements, however, have been hidden by lower top-line volume as rising mortgage rates have curtailed home transactions. As a result, STC shares fell to nearly 90% of book value, well below its 10-year average of 1.3X. As housing sales normalize over time and revenues recover, we view STC’s earnings to have significant upside and the stock should trade closer to its historic average. Moreover, the realization of its improved margin structure could result in a multiple that’s closer to peers First American Financial and Fidelity National Financial, which have historically traded at a premium to STC.” A business executive in a sharp suit shaking hands on a real estate deal.
