Table of Contents Table of Contents Are you trying to figure out how to spend your hard-earned Citi ThankYou points? There are many ways to redeem them, some of which provide better value than others. While exchanging your Citi ThankYou points for cash back or statement credits is straightforward and convenient, the simplicity comes with a trade-off, as points are typically only worth 0.5 cent per point when you go that route.  Citi also lets you redeem points for travel booked through its own travel portal, where points are worth 1 cent apiece. But then there’s the most superior way to use Citi ThankYou points, and that’s taking advantage of Citi’s transfer partners. Citi’s transfer partners are largely other hotel and airline loyalty programs, which allow you to convert your ThankYou points to their own currency. Much like any other currency exchange, transfer ratios differ by program.  Often, transfers are 1:1, meaning you hand over 1 ThankYou point for 1 hotel or airline point or mile. But that’s not always the case, and many Citi transfer partners offer outsized value. In fact, NerdWallet estimates the overall transfer value between 1 cent and 1.3 cents. In short, converting your Citi ThankYou points to other airline and hotel loyalty programs through Citi’s transfer partners is one of the best ways to spend your points. Let’s look at the different Citi transfer partners and their transfer ratios. Citi’s transfer partners include more than a dozen airlines and two hotels, depending on the credit card you have. Citi also has one non-travel partner called Shop Your Way, which is a shopping loyalty program that earns points redeemable for retail gift cards. Note that while these are the typical transfer ratios offered, the program does offer one-off promotions that bump up ratios from time to time.  If you have a Citi Double Cash® Card, Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card (not open to new applications) or Citi Rewards+® Card, you can only transfer points to the following three travel partners: Choice Privileges (1:1.5 ratio). Wyndham Rewards (1:0.8 ratio). JetBlue TrueBlue (1:0.8 ratio).

Even without a credit card, you could earn points by taking certain actions with eligible Citibank consumer checking accounts, such as enrolling in direct deposit.  The more common way to earn points is through spending on a Citi credit card that participates in ThankYou Rewards, both through taking advantage of introductory offers — where you can get a windfall of points upon meeting a certain threshold within a window of time upon card approval — and through ongoing spending. Just note that not all Citi credit cards earn transferable ThankYou points. Citi cards that do earn transferable ThankYou points include: Citi Prestige® Card. Citi Premier® Card. Citi Strata Premier℠ Card.  Citi ThankYou® Preferred Card. Citi Rewards+® Card. Citi Double Cash® Card. Some of these cards offer bonus points in certain categories, so someone seeking to maximize their points earning might have one card for dining out and another for supermarkets, and perhaps even another for everyday spending. » Learn more: The best Citi transfer partners The ThankYou Rewards program has a feature called Points Sharing, where you can give qualifying ThankYou points to another ThankYou member at no additional fee. This can be a helpful way to quickly get more points. Say you and a friend are trying to book a hotel room together but you don’t have enough points on your own to book the room. They can send their points to you, in theory giving you a high enough point balance to book. There are some limitations when it comes to sharing points through Citi. Shared points received are valid for just 90 days from the date received, so you’ll have to quickly book travel (or transfer them to one of Citi’s partners) once your friend sends their points to you. There’s also a cap of how many points you can transfer: 100,000 in a calendar year. While you might book hotels and airfares with cash or through Citi’s own travel portal called the Citi ThankYou Rewards Travel Center, it’s often a better deal to put in the extra effort and transfer your points to one of Citi’s transfer partners. That said, folks seeking to maximize value should always calculate the value of the Citi ThankYou points relative to the price to pay for airfare or hotel rooms in cash. Use NerdWallet’s Citi ThankYou points calculator below to determine the value of your points, based on both the baseline and NerdWallet estimated values: In general — and as is the case with most other flexible point currencies — Citi ThankYou points become most potent when transferred to partners. Happily, for Citi cardholders, there are various programs to choose from, including representations from all three major airline alliances. However, before you transfer your points, you’ll want to make sure that it makes sense. Not all points are equal, and each program will value its currency independently. So it’s a good idea to research Citi’s best transfer partners to maximize your redemptions, no matter where you’re traveling. You want a travel credit card that prioritizes what’s important to you.
