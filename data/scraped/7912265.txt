Jakarta (VNA) – Indonesia has deployed 142 armored fighting vehicles to ensure optimal security for the upcoming 42nd ASEAN Summit which will last from May 9-11 in Labuan Bajo, East Nusa Tenggara.  Commander of KRI Banjarmasin-592 Marine, Lieutenant Colonel Agung Ari Wibowo said the vehicles include escort motorbikes and vehicles for transporting equipment and troops, among others. In addition to armored military vehicles and the main weapons system, KRI Banjarmasin 592 also transported hundreds of soldiers to Labuan Bajo to carry out security tasks during the summit.  Agung said KRI Banjarmasin -592 left Labuan Bajo for Jakarta on May 2. After that, two warships KRI Teluk Youtefa 522 and KRI dr. Soeharso 990 will continue to transport defence equipment to Labuan Bajo.  In addition to the Indonesian Army (TNI), the Indonesian National Police (Polri) will also deploy 115 electric vehicles, including 35 Hyundai Ioniq vehicles, to transport high ranking leaders and official delegates at the event. Earlier, TNI Commander Admiral Yudo Margono said that the force plans to deploy warships around Labuan Bajo to ensure security for the summit. According to Yudo, warships are neccessary as the summit venue is surrounded by the sea. In addition, the location is narrow, so the deployment of alutsista needs to be adjusted to suit the terrain./. Copyright, VietnamPlus, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Editor-in-chief, Mr. Tran Tien Duan.
