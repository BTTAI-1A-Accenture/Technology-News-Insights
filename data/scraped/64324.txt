20th Aug, 2024 DROITWICH Spa Community Choir is holding a spring concert on March 25. The group will be joined by Hanbury School Choir and Droitwich Ukulele Club for the event at Droitwich Baptist Church at 7pm. Admission is free, as are the refreshments, but donations are requested for the chosen charity, the Acorns Hospice Trust. The choir is hoping to at least raise £1,000 – the same amount collected at last year’s concert. Receive a weekly update to your inbox by signing up to our weekly newsletter.
