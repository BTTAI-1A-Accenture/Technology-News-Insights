 Recent and Fiscal 2023 Operational Highlights Financial Results Revenue The Company achieved record revenue of $20.7 million during the year ended April 30, 2023, a 6.7% increase from the year ended April 30, 2022. Revenue growth from the prior year was 9.0% when adjusting for the effect of currency translations. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by growth in the Company's B cell Select® platform and protein manufacturing services.

Expenditures on research activities totaled $10.8 million during the year ended April 30, 2023 (2022 - $6.7 million), including $8.3 million on Talem's PolyTope® antibody combination therapy. Additional expenditures include compensation expense of $1.2 million (2022 - $0.7 million), and depreciation of $0.2 million (2022 - $0.2 million).

 Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses totaled $3.6 million during the year ended April 30, 2023, compared to $2.7 million during the year ended April 30, 2022.

 General and administrative During the year ended April 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses totaled $19.8 million, an increase of $4.4 million compared to the year ended April 30, 2022. Salaries and benefits increased $2.1 million due primarily to the addition of staff at BioStrand and routine pay increases. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.5 million related to the BioStrand cash-generating unit. Professional fees decreased $0.2 million, driven primarily by a decrease in legal costs. Management fees increased $1.3 million due to contracted general managers at the BioStrand site. Share-based payment expenses decreased by $1.0 million.

 Other Income / Expense The Company recorded other income of $0.8 during the year ended April 30, 2023, compared to other income of $0.9 million during the year ended April 30, 2022. The most noteworthy variance is the decrease in unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.4 million compared to the year ended April 30, 2022, a result of currency revaluations at the current quarter-end exchange rate. Grant income increased $0.3 million compared to the year prior, as the Company recorded the first round of grant funding from VLAIO (Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship), the research fund of the Flemish regional government in Belgium.

 Net Loss The Company recorded a net loss of $26.6 million during the year ended April 30, 2023, compared to a net loss of $16.7 million during the year ended April 30, 2022. The increased net loss is the result of an increase in gross profit of $0.6 million, offset by an increase in research and development expenses of $4.6 million, an increase in sales and marketing expenses of $0.9 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4.4 million.
