The Walt Disney Company has opened other animated studios besides the main studio, Walt Disney Animation Studios, that arose out of its original primary operations of animated shorts. Some originated from within the company as they expanded the range of distribution for its animated productions; others were by acquisition.
 Studio Ghibli, dispute not being owned by them have had theirt films dubbed and distributed by Disney, with the company distributing in Japan (Home Media), France, and Taiwan (some releases).
 After the Disney animated features department, the next animated division was its TV animated unit, Walt Disney Television Animation, formed in November 1984. Three overseas animation studios (Australia, Japan, and Canada) were set up to produce the company's animated television series.
 Walt Disney Feature Animation would open up a studio in Florida in 1989, and co-produced various animated movies with Feature Animation.
 A sub-unit, titled Disney MovieToons was formed by Walt Disney Television Animation in 1990, with its first feature production was DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp (1990), based upon the syndicated Disney TV show, DuckTales, with animation from Walt Disney Animation France.
 In 1994, Disney began to produce Direct-to-video sequels to their animated movies, and so another division of Walt Disney Television Animation was formed, called Disney Video Premieres (or Walt Disney Video Premiere), which was part of Disney MovieToons. The first of these releases was the Aladdin sequel The Return of Jafar in 1994.
 With Disney acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC in 1995, it also included DIC Productions L.P., a limited partnership between Andy Heyward and CC/ABC.
 On February 29, 1996, Disney purchased Jumbo Pictures, Inc., Inc. With this, their popular Nickelodeon hit series Doug was transitioned over to Disney. In April 1996, Disney purchased Dream Quest Images to replace Buena Vista Visual Effects. In August 1996, Disney and Tokuma Shoten Publishing agreed that Disney would distribute Studio Ghibli animated films internationally, starting with Princess Mononoke.
 In October 1999, Dream Quest Images merged with Walt Disney Feature Animation;'s computer-graphics operation to form The Secret Lab, which made only one film, Dinosaur (2000).
 In Spring 2000, due to weak financial performance, Walt Disney Animation Canada was closed down with their current project, Peter and Jane being moved to the Australia and Japan units and would eventually be released as Return to Never Land. On November 17, 2000, Andy Heyward through Bain Capital re-purchased DIC Entertainment L.P. from Disney, and would eventually be renamed to DIC Entertainment Corporation a year later. DIC still maintained a partnership with Disney afterwards.
 Disney purchased Fox Family Worldwide on October 24, 2001, which not only included the Fox Family Channel, it also included ownership of several units owned by the company, including Saban Entertainment, Saban International, a 75% stake in Fox Kids Europe N.V., Saban International Paris, and other assets. The US Fox Kids block was not included as part of this purchase (Retained by Fox) and nether was the Australian Fox Kids channel (was fully owned by Foxtel, a subsidiary of News Corporation at the time). The main company was renamed to ABC Family Worldwide, while the Saban Entertainment subsidiaries were renamed to BVS Entertainment, Inc. and BVS International N.V. respectively. Saban International Paris however, was split off to become an independent animation studio later that year. Disney followed up the Fox Family purchase with the acquisition of The Baby Einstein Company on November 6.
 A year after being sold off by ABC Family Worldwide, Disney purchased a 49% minority stake in Saban International Paris, but since they weren't part of BVS Entertainment (Saban Entertainment) anymore, the company could no longer use the “Saban” corporate bug in their company name and so they were renamed to SIP Animation on October 1st 2002.
 In January 2003, Disney initiated a reorganization of its theatrical and animation units to improve resource usage and continued focus on new characters and franchise development. Walt Disney Television Animation was transferred over to Disney Channels Worldwide while Disney MovieToons/Disney Video Premieres was transferred from Television Animation to Feature Animation and renamed Disneytoon Studios in June. Additionally, Feature Animation was transferred to The Walt Disney Studios. Summer 2003, saw the closing of Disney Animation France. Additionally, Disney signed a four animated film deal with Vanguard Animation, which only one film was released as part of the deal. In September 2003, Disney Animation Japan was closed.
 On January 12, 2004, Disney shut down Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida.
 Pixar and Disney had a seven feature agreement that allowed Disney to have the Pixar character rights. With the success of Toy Story 2 in 1999, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner and Pixar CEO Steve Jobs began to disagree on how Pixar should be run and the terms of a continued relationship. Eisner claimed that Toy Story 2 would not count towards the "original" film count of the agreement. Jobs announced in January 2004 — after 10 months of bargaining — that Pixar would not renew their agreement with Disney and would seek out other distributors for releases starting in 2006. In 2004, Disney Circle 7 Animation was formed as a CG animation studio to create sequels to the Disney-owned Pixar properties. In Late January 2006, new Disney CEO Bob Iger and Jobs agreed to have Disney purchase Pixar which lead to Disney closing Circle 7.
 In February 2007, Disney formed a joint venture with ImageMovers, titled ImageMovers Digital, which would produce motion captured movies.
 In December 2008, Disney announced that they would be purchasing the remains of Jetix Europe they didn't own and have it delisted from the Euronext. Afterwards, the company went dormant as all the Jetix channels owned by them were rebranded as Disney XD or Disney Channel.
 SIP Animation was subject to liquidation on May 11, 2009 after falling into dormancy after Disney fully purchased their main client Jetix Europe, and eventually closed down later on. With Disney's 2009 purchase of Marvel Entertainment, Disney acquired Marvel Animation, which remains apart of Marvel Entertainment.
 ImageMovers Digital closed operations by January 2011, after the production was completed on Mars Needs Moms.
 Lucasfilm Animation was purchased as a unit of Lucasfilm in 2012.
 The Baby Einstein Company would be purchased by Kids II, Inc. in 2013 after they stopped producing animation.
 On June 30, 2018, Disneytoon Studios was closed down.

Disney Animation Australia (DAA), also Disneytoon Studios Australia, was a Disney animation studio located in Sydney, Australia.
 DAA was started in 1988 at the former Hanna-Barbera overseas studio in St. Leonards, Sydney. Initially, Animation Australia worked on various television shows including Winnie the Pooh, Darkwing Duck, Goof Troop, Aladdin, Timon and Pumbaa, and Duck Daze. As staffing increased, the studio moved to Castlereagh Street.
 Disney began producing Direct-to-video sequels of its Feature Animation productions, the first of which was the Aladdin sequel The Return of Jafar. When Aladdin was selected as a possible candidate as an animated TV series (before the film's release), as with many animated series, the first three episodes were one multi-part story which Disney used as a potential ‘family movie special’ for the Friday night before the series’ premiere. With work handed out to the Australia animation studio, the opening story was instead greenlit for a direct-to-video release. Thus with "Jafar" and its success, the direct-to-video unit started. Then a second sequel, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, assign work to both the Australia and Japanese animation units.
 Australia was assigned additional film sequels: The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, An Extremely Goofy Movie and Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure. The company's first feature film was Return to Neverland in 2002 grossing over $100 million worldwide at the box office. In 2005, the studio produced three animated movies: Tarzan 2, Lilo and Stitch 2 and Bambi 2.
 Disney Animation Australia was closed in mid-2006 after finishing Brother Bear II and Cinderella III.
