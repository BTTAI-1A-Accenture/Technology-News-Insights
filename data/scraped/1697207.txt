© Petre Thomas-USA TODAY Sports The Milwaukee Bucks will have their cornerstones back as they seek redemption next season. Per multiple reports, veteran center Brook Lopez has agreed to re-sign with the Bucks on a two-year, $48 million dollar deal. The first day of free agency signing on Friday saw the Bucks lock up Khris Middleton to a three-year, $102 million contract. Milwaukee then wasted no time in keeping the valuable services of Lopez. With those two separate deals, the Bucks achieved their goal of keeping their core intact as Lopez and Middleton will continue to play alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday as they bid to regain lost glory after they suffered two straight early playoff exits. Lopez will be entering his 16th NBA season. He joined the league as the 10th overall pick by the New Jersey Nets in the 2008 NBA Draft. The sweet-shooting center has shown no signs of slowing down, as he was a major contributor for the Bucks last season. Last year, Lopez only missed four games and started in all 78 games that he played. Lopez ended the past season with averages of 15.9 points, 6.7 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 0.5 steals, and 2.9 blocks a game. Knocking down outside shots has been Lopez’s strong suit as he finished the recently ended season shooting 53.1 percent from the field, including a 37.4 percent clip from the three-point area. Acquired by Milwaukee in July 2018, Lopez was part of last season’s NBA All-Defensive First Team, and he narrowly missed winning the Defensive Player of the Year award.
