Canada released a joint statement with 10 southeast Asian countries Wednesday that lays out a commitment to tackle global food insecurity and nutritional needs. It’s part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s commitment to invest in the Indo-Pacific region on green infrastructure and supply chain resilience, especially around food supply. He delivered a speech at the ASEAN-Indo-Pacific Forum. He says Canada is focused on investing in renewable energy, sustainable energy and water projects within the region. Trudeau also pitched Canada as a reliable supplier of natural resources like fertilizer and critical minerals, saying Canada has the clean energy the world needs to help with their green energy transition. In their joint statement, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations says they will work with Canada to sustain supply in the food trade.
