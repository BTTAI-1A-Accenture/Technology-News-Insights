If history is any guide, there may be good fortune ahead for shares of ONEOK OKE.  A so-called "golden cross" has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bullish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used.  The golden cross occurs when the 50-day crosses above the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with ONEOK, which is trading around $65.59 at publication time.  Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Golden Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for long positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible long positions.  With that in mind, take a look at ONEOK's past and upcoming earnings expectations:
