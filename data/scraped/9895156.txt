 Quantum information technology is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the processing and transmission of information using quantum mechanics principles.There is a growing trend toward applying quantum mechanics, a science for studying microscopic particles such as protons and electrons, in computing, communication, and sensing. Quantum computing is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the processing and transmission of information using quantum mechanics principles. Quantum technologies have been under development worldwide for more than 20 years, resulting in promising results and progress. The main research subject of quantum technology is the interdisciplinary subject of quantum mechanics and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Quantum information technology is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the processing and transmission of information using quantum mechanics principles. It includes theoretical research and experimental study in quantum physics and computations. It combines quantum effects in physics with ICT. Now quantum information technology is considered a frontier technology that combines quantum physics and ICT. It has been rapidly developed into an emerging interdisciplinary subject mainly based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and ICT. Quantum computing is a new computing model that follows the laws of quantum mechanics to control quantum information units for computation. For conventional computation, its theoretical model is a general-purpose Turing machine.
