Logan Maddox, the play-by-play announcer for the ESPN+ broadcast of Tuesday night's Ole Miss baseball game at Jacksonville State, apologized for a mistake made when describing the position played by Rebels freshman Will Furniss. Furniss, a lefthanded batter, served as Ole Miss' designated hitter in the game. When he stepped to the plate in the top of the sixth inning, Maddox introduced him as the "designated Hitler." Maddox, who works for the Jacksonville State athletic department as a sports information specialist, immediately apologized during the broadcast. "... designated Hitler – excuse me, designated hitter – looking to get aboard," Maddox said on the ESPN+ broadcast. "Sorry about that, folks." The clip, posted by Stephen Schoch on Twitter, had more than 840,000 views at the time of publication on Wednesday afternoon. Maddox shared the post later with the caption, "Whoops." Ole Miss went on to lose the game to the Gamecocks, 10-6, snapping an eight-game winning streak. The Rebels (14-3) begin SEC play when they travel to Vanderbilt (13-5) for a three-game series beginning on Thursday (6 p.m., ESPNU).
