     Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., on the concerns with the Trump case and former Biden aide questioned in a classified document probe House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., this week defended his decision to gather information about President Biden's possible connections to Hunter Biden's business dealings from whistleblowers without giving committee Democrats access to those witnesses. Comer said some witnesses fear being outed by Democrats, which justifies the move to collect information from them without exposing them to Democratic members of the committee. "Multiple individuals have approached the Oversight Committee as whistleblowers with a desire to share information confidentially," Comer said Thursday. "It should be no surprise that whistleblowers do not trust Ranking Member [Jamie] Raskin. He has revealed himself to be untrustworthy by releasing disingenuous, misleading financial information from the Committee’s investigation. A spokesperson for the committee added that Republicans are protecting these witnesses from Democrats who have shown a willingness to expose them.

"It’s understandable why whistleblowers don’t want their identities and the information they are providing to be shared with the Democrats." "Chairman Comer is protecting these whistleblowers," the spokesperson added. Comer's statement was released on the same day that the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., accused Republicans of "deliberately" withholding information about witnesses in the investigation. "It has been nearly three months since you assumed responsibility of the Committee, and in that time, I have grown increasingly alarmed by your efforts to shield information from Committee Democrats, including information collected as part of your investigation into members of the President’s family," Raskin wrote to Comer.

Comer fired back that Raskin is "playing lawyer for the Biden family" and said the information Republicans have collected so far show clear links between Hunter Biden and the Biden family, including President Biden. "Just a few weeks ago, when making public the Oversight Committee’s first subpoena to a bank, Ranking Member Raskin tried to brush away the documents as just purchases at Papa John’s and Starbucks, conveniently omitting, as just one example, a Chinese company’s $3 million wire to an associate of the Biden family who proceeded to transfer more than $1 million of it to various Biden family accounts," Comer said.
