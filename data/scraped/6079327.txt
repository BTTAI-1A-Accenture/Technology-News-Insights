The U.S. Senate Finance Committee has sent letters to eight automakers asking them to clarify whether materials from their vehicles came from the Xinjiang region of China, an area that is rumored to use forced labor. The request comes on the heels of a report from the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice at Sheffield Hallam University. The report alleges that the "Chinese government has deliberately shifted raw materials mining and processing and auto parts manufacturing into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.” Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota, and Volkswagen were all sent identical letters asking them to answer seven questions related to their supply chains.  In a recent quote, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden said, “I recognize automobiles contain numerous parts sourced across the world and are subject to complex supply chains. However, this recognition cannot cause the United States to compromise its fundamental commitment to upholding human rights and U.S. law.”
