  Mon 19 Aug 2024   @ Contact us Your newsletters Until recent months, artificial intelligence, known as AI, was a mysterious and obscure concept for many of us. Now it’s revolutionising our world. While the technology is expected to replace millions of jobs worldwide, a legion of people are already using it to make their work easier. Thanks to an explosion of a new breed of mind-blowing “generative” AI tools, the technology is accessible to any business or individual, transforming the way they go about their day-to-day activities. OpenAI’s ChatGPT,  which attracted one million users soon after its launch last November, allows you to have human-like conversations and is being used to write emails, essays, poetry, even computer code and much more. It has been trained using databases from the internet, and ChatGPT-3 has been made available to the public as a free research preview. Its latest paid-for model, ChatGPT-4, was trained on about 500 billion words. Another OpenAI project, Dall-E 2, creates realistic images and art from a text command (called a prompt). While these tools are producing varying results at present, they are certainly going to keep getting better and better. We asked three entrepreneurs how they were using AI to boost their productivity and save time. Who are you and what do you do? My name’s James Callahan and I’m CEO and co-founder of FutureDeluxe, a global creative studio. I’m 40 and live in Gloucestershire. How do you use AI and what tools do you use? I use ChatGPT for proposals and copy for presentations to send to clients or prospective clients. I put bullet points of what I want to say into it and the chatbot fleshes it out into well-written larger piece. I’m dyslexic and a spell-checker is great but it can’t help with the structure of sentences. We have some big-brand clients – including Apple, Converse, Nike, PlayStation and Sony – and I need to appear professional.  My team uses AI in the creative process: to generate images to communicate design ideas to send to clients. We used Dall-e, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. Then we take them to Photoshop and add in assets they’ve created. We are transparent with clients that we are using AI for this. The prompt writing can be a bit tedious but it’s great for quickly spitting out lots of images to work from. Then we will work from scratch on the proper design.  We have also been making use of AI for professional headshot images for my staff. We’ve used Try It on AI for that. It can put people in suits and create nice backgrounds. The results do vary, but we’ve had some fairly decent ones. How is it making you more productive? ChatGPT has been an absolute game-changer. I’m full of valuable insights but when it comes to the written word, my poor spelling and syntax have – until now – held me back. If you can’t draw, no one thinks you’re not intelligent. But we live in a world that often penalises intelligent dyslexics by judging them on their grammar. ChatGPT is a huge hack. It completely makes sense of my rambling bullet-pointed thoughts. It takes away the embarrassment.  How much time is it saving you? About a couple of hours a week. I no longer have to appease the grammar police by spending three times longer than everyone else on written comms. This means my time is freed up to invest my skills where they belong – on the design and management side of my business, rather than the writing. The main benefit is that I can stop relying so much on other people – such as my business partner and wife – to check my work.  It’s been an absolute godsend. And I can’t wait for it to evolve even further. Who are you and what do you do? I’m Neil Cookson and I’m a professional wedding DJ. I’m in the early stages of growing my business, Multiplex Decks, into an agency, booking gigs for other DJs and musicians including saxophonists. I’m 43 and I live on the Wirral, Merseyside. How do you use AI and what tools do you use? I’ve been using ChatGPT for business growth ideas. It asked me 30 questions about my business, such as my goals and target audience, and while it was long-winded, it was worthwhile. I’ve had lots of ideas buzzing round my head and the chatbot helped me structure those thoughts in the form of a business plan. It’s given me some good insights on how I can drive growth and improve conversions. It’s great that you can save the conversation and it will remember what you’ve talked about. I’ve also used it to rewrite my website copy, improve the site’s SEO and write a promotional video script.  I’ve been a DJ for over 20 years so I know my music, but now and again I use it for music selection suggestions. For example, I will type “give me 20 well-known music tracks for 21-year-olds” which helps me stay down with the kids. I performed at [the England footballer] Harry Maguire’s 30th recently and used it for this. I’ve been playing with the video-editing software Descript, which has an “overdub” feature that allows you to clone your voice. You can correct recording mistakes by simply editing the text, avoiding re-recording. AI can also be used by a DJ to create new music… new beats, melodies, and chord progressions, which can then be incorporated into the DJ’s performances. You can even clone the voices of famous singers now. David Guetta recently shared a video of him playing an AI-generated track he produced using the voice of Eminem, or “Emin-AI-Em” as he called it. It’s mind-blowing how AI is changing music. Let me introduce you to… Emin-AI-em 👀 pic.twitter.com/48prbMIBtv How is it making you more productive? You can spend hours searching for things on the internet so it’s fantastic to have a concise summary with ChatGPT. Of course, it’s a tool: with marketing copy you’ll probably need to make changes, but it’s really helpful to have a starting point. I’m keen to learn more about how I can automate mundane tasks. How much time is it saving you? That’s a bit tricky to answer, because I’m spending more time on my business now because I’m growing it. It’s certainly helping me appear more professional without forking out on experts, which is great when you’re a solo entrepreneur like me with limited resources. Who are you and what do you do? My name is Hannah Roper and I’m a business coach and podcaster. I’m 41 and live in Portsmouth. How do you use AI and what tools do you use? I host The Female Creative Talks Podcast and I had 40-odd podcasts I’d been meaning to turn into social media content but I was struggling to find the time. I turn it into a blog first using the transcription tool Otter.ai to turn the audio into text. Then I use ChatGTP to turn it into a blog-style piece of content. Then I put the blog through ChatGPT asking it to create a 2,000 word character version pulling out the key points to create a nine-slide Instagram carousel. I always give it the instruction to use a conversational style and include certain key words and I tell it who the audience is.  I have also used AI to create interview questions for country music artists and create social media content for my radio show. After trying it out myself I have recommended AI to my coaching clients who have used it to help create blogs, social media captions, website copy and elevator pitches. I also use it for my kids’ homework if I don’t know the answers!  How is it making you more productive? It really speeds up the process when you’re re-purposing content. I still edit it and need to change things but it saves a lot of time. I’ve learnt that when you’re instructional with it, it churns out content that’s more suitable for what I’m looking for. To take it into audio to a written form is a bit difficult. I saw a prompt on Instagram and I thought I’d give it a go and it’s kind of like a formula.  How much time is it saving you? AI saves me hours and hours of time. I was really struggling getting blogs out there. It would take me two to three hours to write a blog and I would never turn them into social media content, whereas now I’m not having to write from scratch I can get a blog up and down in half an hour. From one blog I’m able to produce two or three social media posts using a virtual assistant that I can set up within 20 minutes instead of hours. Do you have a real life story?
