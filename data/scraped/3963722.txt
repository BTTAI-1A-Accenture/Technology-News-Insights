Expert Reviewed Updated: Jul 18, 2024, 2:08pm Chances are, you probably don’t need to pay for an antivirus. This is a strange thing to say at the beginning of an article about the best antivirus software on the market, but it’s true. Microsoft Defender, which is part of the larger Windows package, is good enough for most personal use cases, and businesses should consider more robust endpoint protection solutions. That said, antivirus programs are still some of the most popular pieces of cybersecurity software in the world today, and it’s important that people understand what they’re paying for when they purchase these services.

All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Learn more: How We Review Antivirus Software As we stated in our intro, the average person probably doesn’t need an antivirus and businesses can benefit instead from endpoint detection and other more bespoke cybersecurity solutions. Antivirus software is a huge drain on your computer’s performance and (in some cases) your wallet. In extreme cases, antivirus software may exhibit behavior that resembles malware by bombarding users with notifications and disrupting internet connectivity even after removal. The software can linger in your machine after trying to uninstall it, which has led to the development of software specifically designed to fully remove traces of antivirus programs from a user’s computer. All of this is true across most major platforms. If you’re a personal user on Windows, Defender will be enough to meet your needs in most cases. If you use macOS, you probably don’t need one at all, but Malwarebytes is there if you feel the need to run a scan without a huge drain on your funds or resources. With Android, your best bet is to use good cybersecurity hygiene practices with how/where you browse and download files online. On iOS, any so-called antivirus will not work due to the way iOS sandboxes its apps from the larger system, preventing the app from obtaining the necessary privileges needed to do its job. And finally, if you’re on Linux, you probably know better already. Starting price  Free; $29.99 per year for the first year for up to three devices

 30 days Bitdefender is one of the better options if you really want to purchase an antivirus program. It scores well in independent testing from websites like av-test.org, which looks at how well the service detects malware. It’s not better than Windows Defender and can be a significant resource drain (as most antiviruses are). However, its notifications aren’t as nagging or full of fearmongering as some of its competitors. Business users are better off looking at the company’s business-focused Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) solutions. Overall, our direct testing experience with Bitdefender was fine. It was one of the least annoying antiviruses to work with, even though it still slowed us down considerably. Its notifications weren’t irritating, and, as stated above, it scored well enough in independent testing that we felt confident the antivirus would detect at least some malware if we came across it while browsing the web. However, we lack the testing environment to test the service’s malware capabilities ourselves. Taimur Ijlal, a tech expert and information security leader at Netify, shared his experience with the software: “I think Bitdefender strikes the best balance between security capabilities and minimizing impact on performance. In my testing, it had among the highest detection rates and caught malware very quickly. Yet, the system impact was very low—my machines felt just as fast with it installed. Bitdefender’s feature set is also quite full-featured. It protects beyond just malware to also shield against web and ransomware threats through its various modules.” Bitdefender’s reputation is typical for companies in this industry, with a somewhat murky standing. The company has done good work uncovering security flaws in tech like the Wyze home security cameras in the past. However, the company’s servers were hacked in 2015, leaking some of its business clients’ passwords. Worst of all, these passwords were unencrypted, meaning the company was just storing this sensitive information without doing anything to protect users in the event of this sort of breach. That was nearly a decade ago, and it’s entirely possible that Bitdefender has taken measures to address this baffling misstep. However, we wouldn’t trust a cybersecurity company that did this with our sensitive data at any point in its history, and we don’t think you should either.

 60 days Avira isn’t the worst antivirus by any stretch of the imagination, but it’s far from the best. Its independent testing results from websites like AV TEST and AV-Comparatives were middle-of-the-pack, and its scan speeds during our testing were fairly slow. However, the overall impact on device performance was minimal, though it did crash the first time we tried to scan something. It takes a spot on the list thanks to its affordability and its relatively low drain on system resources when in use. We generally caution readers away from free antiviruses, but Avira’s paid plans are on the cheaper side as far as antiviruses go, and that counts for something if you feel the need to download an antivirus but are on a budget. George Otte, owner of Geeks On Site, hasn’t had a great experience with Avira: “Out of all the programs listed, I’ve encountered more installation and activation issues with this one. It consistently causes problems when trying to create system restore points using PowerShell scripting and tends to block mrt.exe (MSRT)—the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool—from accessing files, requiring manual exceptions.” Avira’s reputation as an antivirus isn’t much to look at, however. In the past, some users criticized the company for poor virus detection, which is backed up by its mediocre independent testing scores. On top of that, in December 2023, the software was found to have a major bug that caused Windows users’ devices to freeze after booting up. Then there’s the matter of its ownership. In 2020, Avira was purchased by Gen Digital (fka Norton Lifelock and Symantec), the owners of the popular Norton 360 antivirus platform. We tested Norton 360 for this list but ultimately decided to cut it due to the company’s poor reputation and product. Avira’s product, while uninspiring, does not run off the same technology as Norton Antivirus, as far as we can tell, and Avira itself hasn’t been subject to as many controversies as Norton has over the years. As a result, Avira stays on the list for now. See MoreSee Less Starting price  Free; $59.88 for the first year for 10 devices

 30 days AVG is one of the most popular antiviruses on the market, thanks in part to its free version. We caution readers against using free antiviruses as a general rule, but the allure of free stuff for most people can be too enticing. AVG also features business-focused plans and add-ons for things like patch management, which are nice, but again, we recommend businesses look for more robust endpoint protection. Taimur Ijlal, a tech expert and information security leader at Netify, agrees that AVG is for basic needs: “In my view, AVG is suitable only for bare-bones protection when funds are very tight. But as needs become more sophisticated, it may start to feel restricted without the extra security layers. A feature like centralized management alone could be quite valuable for multiple users. During independent reviews from AV-TEST and AV-Comparatives, it performed exceptionally well, scoring all sixes from AV-TEST and ranking near the top in Malware Protection from AV-Comparatives. When we tested it ourselves, AVG was adequate, offering a heavier performance impact than Avira but nothing spectacular. A full scan took longer than other providers on this list. Its installation process was also on the slower side. It should be mentioned that Avast and AVG use the exact same engine for their antivirus software. For those who worry about privacy, there are other causes for concern. Thanks to a 2020 joint investigation by PCMag and Vice Motherboard, Avast and AVG were caught collecting user data via browser extensions and the free version of their antivirus software. This by itself is normal, as any antivirus provider with browser protections will do so as a matter of course. However, Avast and AVG were found to be monetizing user data via Avast subsidiary Jumpshot. In the wake of the investigation, Avast terminated Jumpshot and has not made any moves to suggest it has returned to its data monetizing ways. However, the relative recency of the event coupled with how much sensitive data an antivirus can collect from users makes us unable to trust AVG or Avast with our own data, and we don’t believe you should trust them with yours either.

 30 days The world’s first commercial antivirus is still around and has some nice things going for it, namely cheap introductory pricing and plans for unlimited devices. It’s done decently well in recent independent testing, but it’s nothing spectacular. Our testing experience with the software was incredibly poor. The website was a pain to navigate even when purchasing the software, our machine slowed to a crawl when the antivirus was scanning and the scan itself took forever. The only nice thing we can say about our experience is that the UI was clean and easy to navigate. We wish they’d put the same care into their website. We were also not too pleased with how McAfee operates its Virus Protection Pledge, where the company will offer a refund of your current-term subscription if the antivirus cannot remove a virus from your computer. This refund pledge only works if you have auto-renewal turned on, a detail tucked away at the bottom of its product page in a dropdown box with small text. McAfee’s antivirus reputation is not great, and it is known for being one of the antivirus programs that require specific tools to be completely removed from your computer, a trait it shares with Norton. It’s on this list due to its popularity and introductory pricing, but also because its popularity does mean that some users might fall into the trap of thinking that name brand recognition is the same as a quality product. We really can’t see a reason why any Windows user would use it over Microsoft Defender, and its offering on other platforms isn’t much better. George Otte, owner of Geeks On Site, also warns about McAfee’s poor reputation: “McAfee has had a rocky history with me. In the past, it appeared to be bypassed by malware more frequently than other paid protection software (excluding Norton). It also had a reputation for blocking internet access when corrupted, although this issue seems to have improved over time. I attribute this improvement more to changes in the threat landscape rather than inherent improvements in McAfee’s software.” Learn more: Read our full McAfee review.

 60 days Malwarebytes is one of the few antivirus solutions outside of Microsoft Defender that we think is worth your time. Its free version provides minimal drain on device performance and can sometimes pick up threats Windows Defender misses, making it a decent backup option when you’re worried Defender has missed something. George Otte, owner of Geeks On Site, also likes Malwarebytes: “This tool has proven to be the most effective malware remover I’ve encountered. However, as malware has become less prevalent, its focus has shifted more towards identifying Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs). It seamlessly integrates with other antivirus programs and consistently steps in to clean up when the primary antivirus software is bypassed or fails to detect threats.” Malwarebytes performed decently in independent tests, though AV-TEST marked it as slightly below the industry average when protecting against zero-day malware threats. In cybersecurity terms, a zero-day is a security vulnerability in a system that has yet to be spotted or patched. Zero-day malware, in turn, is malware that doesn’t have a specific virus signature for antiviruses to detect yet. Traditionally, antiviruses detect malware by checking for these specific signatures when scanning files. Malwarebytes’ below-average results in this category basically mean it could be less likely to catch new malware threats that don’t build off previously known malware. We aren’t too crazy about Malwarebytes’ recent behavior. In particular, we’re worried about the company’s layoffs in August 2023, which included several key executive roles. This is on top of Malwarebytes cutting 14% of its global workforce the year prior. Anytime a company lays off a large chunk of its employees, we’re concerned about the effects it can have on the quality of its product moving forward. However, it’s still one of the best antiviruses out there in our opinion and one of the few we’d consider using in concert with Microsoft Defender. Learn more: Read our full Malwarebytes review.

 30 days Avast and AVG are more or less the same antivirus, and our experiences with Avast were about the same as with AVG. As such, the two antivirus programs’ performance in independent testing was identical, earning high marks for both antiviruses. In our own testing, we found that Avast had some of the smallest performance impacts of any antivirus we tested, with a lightning-fast Smart Scan. It was nice, but we didn’t really see what the antivirus brought to the table to make it stand out from the competition. Its office management platform could be nice for businesses with remote workers, but we recommend that businesses not look to antiviruses when they need endpoint protection or device management solutions. Kelly Indah, a tech expert and security analyst at Increditools, shared her experience with Avast: “They’ve been around for ages and do the job of blocking threats, but I’ve found them a bit too invasive at times. Their free version comes with a lot of ads you can’t opt out of. On the plus side, they’re really user-friendly.” There are other causes for concern for those who worry about privacy. Thanks to a 2020 joint investigation by PCMag and Vice Motherboard, Avast and AVG were caught collecting user data via browser extensions and the free version of their antivirus software. This by itself is normal, as any antivirus provider with browser protections will do so as a matter of course. However, Avast and AVG were found to be monetizing user data via Avast subsidiary Jumpshot. In the wake of the investigation, Avast terminated Jumpshot and has not made any moves to suggest it has returned to its data-monetizing ways.

 30 days F-Secure is a decent antivirus with a better-than-average reputation among users. Its independent test results were impressive, earning sixes across the board from AV-TEST and racking up zero false alarms during AV-Comparatives’ March 2023 Malware Protection test. When we tested F-Secure, we found the impact on performance to be middle-of-the-pack compared with other antiviruses we tested. We also noted that our first attempt at running a scan resulted in the app crashing. After finally getting scanning to work, we found that the scans took an exceptionally long time to complete, which was quite frustrating. In terms of pricing, F-Secure is fine but not spectacular. We don’t think its introductory pricing of $69.99 per year for one device is particularly offensive when looking at its competition, but we’d still say it’s too steep, given the existence of effective options like Microsoft Defender at lower price points that can cover a lot of what most users need. Kelly Indah, a tech expert and security analyst at Increditools, shared her thoughts on the software: “It’s a solid program with smarter detection than most. Their paid tiers are worth it for the improved privacy features alone. My one gripe is it could be slightly more lightweight on older systems.” F-Secure Antivirus previously used a version of Bitdefender’s virus scan engine with their own heuristics stacked atop called Aquarius but has since switched to licensing Avira’s technology for their current Capricorn engine. This lines up with us encountering the same initial scan crash on both services. We would be more worried about a provider licensing tech from a Norton-owned company, but F-Secure claims not to share any customer data with Avira. Whether that’s true or not is unverifiable without an independent, publicly available audit of the company’s data-handling practices, but F-Secure has not been caught up in any severe controversies that would make us not trust them by default. The company is also located in Finland, a country known for strong user privacy regulations. Soumya Mahapatra, CEO of Essenvia, sees some pros and cons for F-Secure: “We’ve been using F-Secure for the past couple of years, but we’re thinking of upgrading sometime in the near future. While F-Secure is affordable, has an easy-to-use interface and is constantly updated to detect new malware threats, one area where it really falls short is in phishing protection. We had a brief phishing scare earlier this year, and while nothing critical was compromised, it served as an important reminder that this is one of the biggest vulnerabilities in any online system.” Overall, F-Secure is a fine antivirus, and you could do a lot worse in the space. However, we’re still not sure they’re worth the price for individual use. If you want to use F-Secure for your business, we’d recommend looking at sister company WithSecure, which initially launched out of F-Secure’s corporate security business.

 30 days In the middle and near the end of the list, we end up with a lot of companies that are fine but not too exciting. G DATA is one of those companies. The German-developed antivirus performed well in independent testing, scoring all sixes from AV-TEST and placing sixth in Malware Protection for AV-Comparatives with few false positives. During our own testing, G DATA’s performance impact was noticeable, and it might have caused our device to slow down more than any other antivirus we tested. Installation was also kind of a pain, taking a long time and requiring a restart, which isn’t as common as it used to be. That said, its UI was easy to understand, and its scanning features were quick and informative. We appreciated the ability to specifically check removable devices as well. Many of the features one might expect from a paid antivirus, such as a file shredder or firewall, were either part of more expensive plans or not available at all in the standard G DATA antivirus program we tested. In terms of pricing, G DATA’s standard plan was fine, but if you wanted more features, the service got more and more expensive, which makes sense, but it does mean that the service can take a hefty bite out of your wallet to get everything you might want out of an antivirus. We’re still not convinced its price tag is worth choosing over Microsoft Defender, however. G DATA’s reputation is fine enough. It’s been around for nearly 40 years and claims to be the creator of the first antivirus. It doesn’t have the same stink on its name that other long-standing antivirus providers do, such as McAfee or Norton. However, it’s a bit challenging to find reliable information about the company in English, and the company’s dedicated subreddit has zero posts, which is both unusual and kind of funny.

 30 days Japanese multinational Trend Micro’s cybersecurity technologies can be found throughout the business sector, from cloud data security and behavioral analytics to threat intelligence. Its personal offering isn’t great, however. In independent testing, Trend Micro scored either in the middle or near the bottom. AV-Comparatives ranked it dead last in its March 2023 Malware Protection scoring with a 60.9% off-line detection rate in an area where 90% detection is considered middle-of-the-road at best. Its 97.19% in online detection, while still near the bottom, is still solid. It received fairly unexciting scores from AV-TEST. During our testing, Trend Micro was a usable antivirus with minimal impact on system performance. However, the app also hit us with nonstop add-on offers and pop-ups when we opened the app for the first time. We were even smacked with an offer for its browser protection add-on when opening our browser, which seemed particularly egregious. The annoying ads alone are enough for us to recommend not using Trend Micro. In terms of pricing, Trend Micro isn’t too egregious, but the lack of multi-device licensing options makes it difficult to recommend for business use. George Otte, owner of Geeks On Site, finds Trend Micro to be generally fine: “I haven’t had any issues with this program. It seems like it uses fewer resources than the other programs on this list, with the exception of F-Secure. I like its interface the most.” As a company, Trend Micro hasn’t been caught doing anything egregious, though we’re still a little wary of it. In 2019, Trend Micro customers were victims of attempted scam calls claiming to be Trend Micro tech support trying to access their computers. While the company was obviously not at fault for these scams, affected users did criticize the company for its delayed response to the issue and what they perceived as trying to sweep the issue under the rug.

 30 days ESET has some things going for it. Notably, the software performed well in independent testing, earning solid scores from AV-TEST and ranking near the top for AV-Comparatives. ESET was one of only two providers to notch zero false positives from AV-Comparatives. We also liked its Device Control system, which allows you to customize the software to meet your cybersecurity needs, including setting up specific rules for specific devices. For example, you can use this system to block an external device’s access to your computer or heavily restrict its access privileges. This can theoretically help prevent, for example, someone using a Bluetooth device to hack your machine. It’s a nice feature, but we’re not sure it’s worth the steep cost. George Otte, owner of Geeks On Site, also likes ESET: “This one has grown on me more than any other paid antivirus I’ve come across. What sets it apart is its simple interface and the exceptional documentation available online. “ During our testing, ESET’s impact on performance was extremely noticeable, especially during scanning. It also immediately required a lengthy update on install. These are to be expected with an antivirus, but it’s still disappointing to see. The user experience with an antivirus is obviously not the most important thing, but we’d still prefer it if the software feels easy to use for less tech-savvy clients. In terms of pricing, ESET is on the higher end of expensive, especially for personal use. Business users might find something in the company’s myriad enterprise-focused solutions, but the price tag on those is still pretty steep. In terms of company reputation, ESET is mostly fine. It’s been involved in a couple of controversies, notably a 2018 antitrust lawsuit alongside several other antivirus providers, which was later dropped. However, the Slovakia-based firm has mostly kept its nose clean as far as we can tell. Learn more: Read our full ESET Antivirus review. See MoreSee Less 
 Kaspersky Anti-Virus previously maintained a top spot on our list of the best antivirus software, and for good reason. The program offers excellent protection against all types of malware, including viruses, trojans, worms and spyware. It also features a simple interface that makes it easy to use, even for beginners. However, it’s no longer on our list of recommendations. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has declared Kaspersky a national security risk. With the war in Ukraine, accusations of Russian espionage, the U.S. government banning Kaspersky products from its own systems and a fairly recent iOS hack on its own devices, we recommend you proceed with caution if you choose to use Kaspersky. An antivirus is a program designed to detect and in some cases remove malware from your computer. They’re some of the oldest pieces of commercial software in the world, tracing their roots back to the 1970s with the Reaper program. They’ve often been marketed as the defense against threats online. There are legitimate reasons for having an antivirus, namely for occasional scans to make sure your computer hasn’t been infected with malware. In this regard, some antiviruses do their jobs well, with good detection rates and, on occasion, effective malware removal tools. Antiviruses do have a viable use case, which is why we recommend most Windows users actively employ Microsoft Defender. In modern times, however, antiviruses are more commonly associated with the term bloatware—software with minimal usefulness that eats up tons of a computer’s memory and disk space. This is not without cause. Antiviruses are infamous for slowing an otherwise functional computer to a crawl by just running a scan and for how difficult they are to remove from a computer fully. In particularly severe cases, you can find yourself hit with pop-ups attempting to scare you into reinstalling the antivirus when you boot up your computer. Even the antiviruses’ dedicated removal tools don’t fully finish the job, which is why you can find guides dedicated to completely removing the likes of McAfee, Norton and Avast, among others. The antivirus industry can be a difficult one to navigate when trying to find a product that best fits your needs. If you’re unable to use Microsoft Defender or understandably don’t trust a Microsoft-developed product, here are a few factors you should consider when choosing an antivirus. One of the most important things to consider is the level of protection it provides against threats. The best antivirus software uses a variety of methods to protect your computer, including signature-based detection, heuristic-based detection, behavior monitoring, sandboxing and artificial intelligence. Some threats, such as ransomware, are difficult to detect and require a multilayered approach to security. Others, such as viruses, are easier to detect but can still do a lot of damage if they’re not removed quickly. To assess how reliable an antivirus software is, you should look at independent lab results and user reviews and ensure it takes a multilayered approach to threat prevention, detection and removal. If you run a business, make sure you’re collaborating with your IT department when making this decision as well. New malware threats are constantly created, and old threats are constantly evolving. This means that an antivirus that isn’t consistently updating its virus signature repositories to better detect these new threats isn’t going to be of much use to you. Your software should update its virus definitions at least once a day, but more frequently is better. Some programs allow you to set the frequency of updates, while others update automatically. Most sales pages will tell you how often the software updates. If it doesn’t, ask before you purchase. It’s also a good idea to see if the antivirus has encountered any major bugs or vulnerabilities in the past and how quickly the provider informed users and resolved the issue. Antiviruses are still pieces of software, which means they can be as prone to breaking and glitching as any other. If you really want to pay for an antivirus, you should expect to pay around $30 to $40 for a year’s subscription on a single device, at minimum. This price may vary depending on the program’s features. For example, a business usually pays more for priority support than a home user. The main cost factors for antivirus software are the frequency of updates and the number of devices covered. Some programs offer discounts for multiple devices, while others charge extra for updates that occur more than once a day. Make sure any antivirus you’re considering purchasing has a generous free trial period so you can make sure it’s the right fit for your needs before spending any money. When choosing antivirus software, you should also consider how compatible it is with your operating system and how much of your computer’s resources it consumes. The best software is compatible with all major operating systems: Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux. It’s also important to consider how much of your computer’s resources the software uses. Some programs consume a lot of memory or CPU power, which can slow down your computer or even cause it to crash. It can be hard to find an antivirus that doesn’t cause at least some slowdown, but we’d still recommend looking for one that won’t be too big of a drain on your device’s resources. Good ​customer support options are great to have in case you run into any problems with the software or need help using it. The best antivirus programs offer 24/7 customer support, either by phone or live chat. Most of the time, this will be with a chatbot, but if the provider offers actual support with a human, that’s even better. Check customer reviews for any positive or negative interactions previous users might have had with customer support. Reputation and trustworthiness are important for any cybersecurity company, especially an antivirus provider. You’re essentially trusting this company and its software to keep your device and data safe. As such, we recommend researching any company you might be interested in buying from, looking at user reviews and seeing if they’ve been involved in any major scandals. ASK THE EXPERT Howard Poston Business Expert Zephin Livingston Staff Reviewer Most computers have decent built-in antivirus protection, and protecting against malware on mobile devices largely requires being careful about the apps that you install and the links that you click. If you want a supplementary antivirus, check out independent reviews and avoid anything that is free or comes packaged with other software (browser toolbars, etc.). Business Expert I’d recommend most PC owners use Microsoft Defender. If you really have to buy an antivirus, look for one that has a good reputation and scores well in independent testing. Avoid the big names if you can. Staff Reviewer Antiviruses work by scanning your computer’s files for any patterns its database marks as indicative of malware. Once it detects something, it will either remove the malware automatically or give you a dialogue box asking if you want to “clean” the file. An antivirus can be good for protecting your device from threats that are already in the software’s database, which is why we recommend you pick an antivirus that receives frequent updates, as new or evolving malware is discovered daily. What an antivirus does not protect you against, however, are your own decisions or social engineering attacks. If you’re engaging in behavior like clicking on suspicious email links, installing files from unknown sources or torrenting from unverified seeds, your computer might still get infected with malware that an antivirus program won’t be able to help you with. For most users, the best protection against malware is safe online browsing habits. Some of the most common and effective methods hackers use are social engineering and phishing, where the attacker often tricks users into opening malicious links or downloading malware-infected attachments. An antivirus can help detect and remove malware received from social engineering attacks, but the most effective protection is still prevention. Here are some tips for using safer browsing habits to protect yourself online: Forbes Advisor reviewed 15 of the best antiviruses on the market and scored them on eight primary factors and 33 sub-factors. We used those scores to rate the antiviruses on a scale of one to five. Primary factors we tested included customer service and support, pricing and general features. Our Forbes Advisor experts’ hands-on experience with these antiviruses was also factored into the final scores. While today’s leading antivirus services offer helpful features, the truth of the matter is that it’s not enough to keep you fully protected. Human error is responsible for a large number of security breaches for both private individuals and businesses. Using common sense when it comes to password usage, deciphering phishing scams and other tools are essential when it comes to keeping your information secure. It’s possible, but you really shouldn’t. Antiviruses can cause a large enough drain on system resources to begin with, and having two is probably not going to make you more safe. If you do decide to keep two antiviruses on your device (i.e., Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes), it’s best to disable one while the other is active to ensure minimal device slowdowns. Most of the time, we would say no. However, for Windows users, Microsoft Defender is good enough at malware detection to be worth using in lieu of most paid options. Generally speaking, not really. iPhones that aren’t jailbroken can’t even run a true antivirus program due to the way iOS sandboxes apps. For Android, an antivirus for scanning might be helpful in some cases, but you’re generally better off learning and applying good Internet hygiene practices instead of relying on an antivirus to protect you.
