 Taashi Rowe is the managing editor for EdTech: Focus on K-12 magazine. CDW and Samsung are working together with First Tee — Greater Detroit, a youth organization, to show young players the connection between technology and golf. While the organization’s primary focus is to help youth participants build character, they are also learning that technology can improve their understanding of the game. “First Tee — Greater Detroit is a youth development organization that uses golf to teach kids important life lessons and traits, such as hard work, perseverance, self-confidence, respect,” says Todd Krieger, interim CEO, First Tee — Greater Detroit. “These things are critical to them being successful.”  CDW and Samsung recently donated tablets and Trackman, golf software that provides important data on the players’ games. When off the golf course, the youth can use the Samsung tablets to get a better visual of the course to enhance their play and strategize for a game.   DISCOVER: How Samsung technology solutions can help transform learning.
