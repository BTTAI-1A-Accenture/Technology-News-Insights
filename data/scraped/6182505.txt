Hogwarts Legacy follows a young fifth-year student during their time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Shortly after they arrive at their new school, they are given the option to explore the world outside, where they can pursue a variety of different quests and unlock some extremely helpful abilities.
     Hogwarts Legacy players can only have four spells active at once when they first start out, but more Spell Sets can be unlocked as players progress.                     Unlocking new abilities in Hogwarts Legacy requires the player to earn and exchange Talent Points for whatever they wish to learn. Since the amount of Talent Points obtainable during a playthrough is limited, however, the player will need to forgo some in favor of others. This will limit players to certain playstyles depending on the Talent build they choose, so the player should carefully consider what they want before spending their Talent Points.
      Updated June 19, 2023, by Justin Flynn: While it's possible to complete Hogwarts Legacy without spending all of one's acquired Talent Points, it isn't recommended, as doing so will prevent players from experiencing some of the best features in the game. Aside from learning new spells, unlocking Talent Points is the only way to enhance the protagonist's proficiency in magic, so it's for players to unlock any Talent they can after earning a Talent Point.
                         PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC users have been able to customize their Talent builds since February, so they likely have already decided what Talents are best suited to them. PS4 and Xbox One players, however, will need to familiarize themselves with what each Talent is capable of before deciding to incorporate it into their playstyles.
                     Though players won't be able to access Talents until they have completed the Jackdaw's Rest main quest, they will still be able to obtain Talent Points by leveling their character up. Upon reaching level 5, every level up will reward the player with a Talent Point to spend on whatever Talent they choose. Once the player has reached level 40, they will have received a total of 36 Talent Points, but since there are 48 Talents available, 12 of them will need to be sacrificed.
                         Once the player has gained access to the Talents section in the main menu, they can begin acquiring whatever Talents they see fit from the Spells, Dark Arts, Core, Stealth, and Room of Requirement categories. Acquiring all the Talents from one category will allow the player to fully maximize the category's potential, but choosing Talents from each of them will allow for a much more rounded experience.
                         With 48 Talents to choose from, it can be a little difficult to decide what's best, but it all comes down to what the player prefers. It's important to pay attention to the name of each Talent category before acquiring any Talents from them, as some categories may not be as appealing to the player as others. There are five Talent categories to choose from in Hogwarts Legacy, and they all offer a unique array of abilities.
                         Unlocking all the Talents in the Spells category will result in each of the protagonist's spells receiving a unique upgrade.

                         Before acquiring too many Talents during the early game, the player should consider if they want to use Dark Magic. If they don't, they can feel free to avoid the Dark Arts category altogether. Not using dark magic has its limitations; however, avoiding the Dark Arts category will grant the player 10 extra Talent Points to spend elsewhere.
     Proper composition of spell loadout in Hogwarts Legacy will allow players to deal large damage effortlessly.                     For those who wish to get the most out of a non-Dark Arts Talent build, they will have 38 other Talents to choose from. Sadly, this will still require 2 Talents to be discarded, but deciding which ones is quite easy. These are the best Talents to acquire for those who want to abstain from using the Dark Arts:
                         Incendio Mastery
                         Accio Mastery

                         Protego Absorption
                         Ancient Magic Throw Expertise
                         Swift
                         Spell Knowledge 1
                         Spell Knowledge 2
                         Wiggenweld Potency 1
                         Basic Cast Airborne Absorption
                         Protego Expertise
                         Revelio Mastery
                         Evasion Absorption
                         Stupefy Mastery
                         Spell Knowledge 3
                         Wiggenweld Potency 2
                         Protego Mastery
                         Stupefy Expertise
                         Sense of Secrecy 1
                         Human Demiguise
                         Sense of Secrecy 2
                         Petrificus Totalus Mastery
                         Edurus Potion Potency
                         Fertilizer
                         Maxima Potion Potency
                         Headache
                         Thunderbrew Potency
                         Focus Potion Potency
                         This non-Dark Arts build encourages players to make use of the majority of the Talents available to them, while only discarding a mere few. It also grants access to some of the more overlooked Room of Requirement Talents that, when used correctly, can have pretty devastating effects.
                         This Talent build serves to showcase that a non-Dark Arts user can be just as powerful as a Dark Wizard without resorting to the Unforgivable Curses. It is the perfect choice for those who want to avoid taking Hogwarts Legacy's somewhat darker path.
                         Those who intend to make use of dark magic during their playthrough will be able to acquire 10 Talents from the Dark Arts subcategory. While implementing the Dark Arts into one's playstyle can provide some serious power, it also prevents the player from unlocking other crucial Talents.
                         Thankfully, it is possible to design one's Talent build to allow players to use multiple Talents from each subcategory while also ensuring the protagonist becomes as powerful as they can. To do this, the player should ensure to acquire these 36 Talents:
                         Incendio Mastery
                         Accio Mastery
                         Levioso Mastery
                         Diffindo Mastery
                         Depulso Mastery
                         Confringo Mastery
                         Bombarda Mastery
                         Glacius Mastery
                         Transformation Mastery
                         Stunning Curse
                         Blood Curse
                         Disarming Curse
                         Knockback Curse
                         Crucio Mastery
                         Imperio Mastery
                         Avada Kedavra Mastery
                         Basic Cast Mastery
                         Ancient Magic Throw Expertise
                         Swift
                         Spell Knowledge 1
                         Spell Knowledge 2
                         Wiggenweld Potency 1
                         Basic Cast Airborne Absorption
                         Protego Expertise
                         Revelio Mastery
                         Evasion Absorption
                         Spell Knowledge 3
                         Protego Mastery
                         Stupefy Expertise
                         Sense of Secrecy 1
                         Human Demiguise
                         Sense of Secrecy 2
                         Petrificus Totalus Mastery
                         Edurus Potion Potency
                         Fertilizer
                         Thunderbrew Potency
                         Though choosing this build will grant players some pretty amazing Talents, it will also force them to sacrifice some helpful ones. That said, this build is designed to only include the most powerful Talents available in the game, so whatever Talents are absent are arguably less beneficial than those that are present.
                         Acquiring these 7 Dark Arts Talents will allow players to curse multiple enemies at once and then dispose of them all with a well-timed Avada Kedavra. In order to include these Talents in the overall build, most of the Room of Requirement Talents have to be discarded. Even so, it is still possible to incorporate potions and plants into the player's playstyle with this build, though they won't be as powerful.
                         The only real downside to this build is that it requires players to sacrifice both Wiggenweld Potency Talents. Choosing not to acquire these Talents will result in Wiggenweld Potions only partially healing the protagonist when they are wounded. To make up for this, the player should always ensure to have plenty of Wiggenweld Potions at hand before beginning a battle and should also be prepared to use as many as they need.
                         Although each Talent in Hogwarts Legacy is useful in some way, some are far less reliable than others. That said, what one player considers an unimpressive Talent, another may see as a must-have.
                         Choosing what Talents to avoid getting depends entirely on what players plan to do during their Hogwarts Legacy playthrough. Those planning to rely on stealth to infiltrate enemy encampments should purchase Talents in the Stealth category, players who plan to rely on potions and plants in combat should browse the Room of Requirement category, and those who wish to avoid using Dark Magic no matter what should steer clear of the Dark Arts category.
                         Since Hogwarts Legacy allows for so much variety while in combat, players will likely come to rely on a few specific combinations of spells and abilities. As a result of this, some spells and abilities will end up being discarded; if players are happy with how their current setup is, they should consider avoiding the Talents associated with spells and abilities they rarely use.
                         Players who have already exchanged their Talent Points will not be able to get them back. As a result of this, all unlocked Talents will become permanent fixtures in the protagonist's arsenal, and any other Talents players were hoping to obtain will no longer be available to them when they run out of Talent Points.
     Core Talents in Hogwarts Legacy might not be the quintessential element of a Wizard's strength but one definitely shouldn't neglect them.                     Though PC players can use mods to reset the Talents they have unlocked, console users are stuck with the Talents they purchase.
       Hogwarts Legacy is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with a Switch release scheduled for November 14th, 2023.
