The New York Mets (70-80) and the Miami Marlins (78-73) play the middle contest of a 3-game series at loanDepot park Tuesday. First pitch is scheduled for 6:40 p.m. ET. Let’s analyze BetMGM Sportsbook’s lines around the Mets vs. Marlins odds and make our expert MLB picks and predictions for the best bets. Season series: Mets lead 6-2 The Mets opened the road series with a 2-1 victory on Monday night. New York scored in the top of the 9th inning on a solo homer by INF/OF Jeff McNeil to spoil the night in South Florida. The Marlins were coming in hot after a 3-game high-scoring sweep of the division champ Atlanta Braves. However, the loss dropped them a half-game back of the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds for 1 of the final 2 NL Wild Card spots. LHP Joey Lucchesi vs. LHP Braxton Garrett Lucchesi (3-0, 2.83 ERA) makes his 8th start. He has a 1.26 WHIP, 3.3 BB/9 and 6.2 K/9 in 35 innings. Garrett (9-6, 3.67 ERA) makes his 29th start and 30th overall appearance. He has a 1.16 WHIP, 1.6 BB/9 and 8.8 K/9 in 149 2/3 innings. Play our free daily Pick’em Challenge and win! Play now!

Mets 4, Marlins 2 The METS (+135) might not be going to the postseason, and they’re doing their best to make sure the Marlins (-160) don’t go, either. New York eked out 1-run road win with a dramatic 9th inning HR Monday, and it is now 6-2 in 8 meetings with Miami. These teams meet 5 more times in the next 12 games, and the Mets could be a major reason why the Marlins aren’t included in the postseason. The METS +1.5 (-155) aren’t priced out of line if you’re not quite feeling a 2nd straight win as an underdog, and you want a little insurance instead. The Marlins -1.5 (+125) need a win to keep pace in the Wild Card picture, but Lucchesi has been a tough customer in his return to the majors, while Garrett has been far more effective on the road than at home. It’s a perfect recipe for another underdog win. The UNDER 8 (-110) is the play again on Monday. We saw the total go way Under on Monday, with just 2 total runs scored in the first 8 innings, and 3 runs altogether. It was a crazy turn of events to see a pitcher’s duel in Miami after the Marlins had piled up 36 runs of offense in the 3-game sweep of the Braves in the series prior.
