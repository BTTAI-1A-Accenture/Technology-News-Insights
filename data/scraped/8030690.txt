The S&P/NZX 50
began its rise at noon and closed at 12,152.16 points, up 61.23 points or 0.51 per cent after hitting a morning low of 12,071.18.
 There were 78 gainers and 55 decliners over the whole market on volume of 41.85 million share transactions worth $102.93 million. The volume was boosted by the trade of 18.05 million units in Smartshares Emerging Markets exchange-traded fund worth $23.79m. Greg Smith, head of retail with Devon Funds Management, said the markets were focused on the positives coming out of the US Federal Reserve meeting. “While the Fed was still talking a tough game, there was a step down in the pace of interest rate hikes and a clear signal that the central bank believes that inflation is starting to head in the right direction (downwards). “Last year was all about rising interest rates, persistent inflation and a hard landing for economies. The worst-case outcome might not eventuate as more optimism creeps in and the rally so far this year continues,” said Smith. The Federal Reserve increased its official rate an expected 25 points to a range of 4.5-4.75 per cent – its eighth consecutive hike but lower than the December 50 basis points rise and before then four increases of 75 basis points. Fed chair Jerome Powell said “we can now say for the first time that the disinflationary process has started.” He added that the Fed would need to be restrictive for some time and it had more work to do. “Ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per cent over time,” Powell told the markets. Smith said the European Central Bank and Bank of England were announcing their latest rate decisions overnight and they were likely to follow by moderating the pace of their hikes. On Wall Street, the major indices were down on the interest rate announcement but turned around after Powell provided his commentary.
