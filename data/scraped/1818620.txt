1. General Motors follows Ford, adopts Tesla EV charging standards
General Motors CEO Mary Barra declared that the automaker’s future EVs would use Tesla’s North American Charging Standards. GM plans to include the NACS connector design in its EVs starting in 2025. By 2024, GM EV users will have access to the Tesla Supercharger Network. At first, you’ll need to utilize an adapter. According to Barra, by the spring of next year, GM will have the adapters ready for its EV owners. Read More

3. DeSantis approves bill partially banning direct-to-consumer car sales in Florida
Florida Governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has signed off on a bill prohibiting car manufacturers from using direct-sales models in the state.

Titled HB 637, the measure prevents most automakers from selling directly to consumers, requiring them to rely on franchised dealerships instead starting this July. Other provisions in the law limit the influence car manufacturers can exert over retailer inventories and prices while protecting dealers’ rights to ignore MSRPs and choose their own model mix. Read More
