  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition Ruben Navarrette’s column of June 14, “Haley could make Republican Party human again,’’ is a glaring example of ugly, divisive, bigoted, (yes bigoted) cheerleading for their selected preferred political party. Like op-ed writers from both sides, the most effective tactic is to accuse all those of a different political persuasion of in-human, Constitution shredding, democracy destroying, nefarious behavior. They go on to boast all registered in their party are wonderful, caring saviors of not only the nation, but the entire planet as well. The biggest problem is both sides have way too many followers who actually lap it all up. They even reference these like minded op-ed columnists as “fact checkers.” During campaign season, those seeking office use the same tactic for the same reason. It’s effective. Only after the results are in do they attempt to switch to the ‘Let’s all try to work together” mode. Navarrette’s first line, “In politics, a great story captures the imagination” was certainly appropriate. The headline, “Haley could make the Republican Party human again” could only have been hatched in an unlimited imagination. — Steve Christensen, Oroville Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group
