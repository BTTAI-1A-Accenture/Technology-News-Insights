WithAnO Productions announces the release of its latestfilm, Kill Her Goats. It’s fitting that this film, fashioned as a slow-burn home invasion thriller with a slasher twist, is dropping its first official trailer on Friday the 13th. That’s because Kill Her Goats stars Kane Hodder of Friday The 13th and Hatchet franchise fame as “Goatface,” a gruesome brute who collects cinematic kills throughout this shocking film.   Audra’s graduation gift is her dream house, but it soon becomes a living nightmare when some uninvited guests come to her homecoming party who aren’t very subtle about the fact they don’t approve of the home’s new owner. Newcomer Arielle Raycene stars in Kill Her Goats as Audra. Ellie Gonsalves, Monica Sims, and Dani Mathers also star in the film. Creature effects were done by Ben Bornstein (Resurrection, Nanny).   The film was shot entirely on location on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and is set in the fictional town of West Craven, an homage and nod to the late great Wes Craven and his classic films that writer and director, Steve Wolsh (Muck, 2015), grew up on. Kill Her Goats was produced by WithAnO Productions and will be distributed by Living Dead Media.  Kill Her Goats comes to 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray, and VOD later this year.  Head over to the official website for more about the movie and to pre-order a copy of the limited edition Steelbook.
