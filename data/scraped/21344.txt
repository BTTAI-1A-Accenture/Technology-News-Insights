 RACINE, Wis. (CBS 58) -- The Racine Art Museum is preparing to host its annual "SAVOURing RAM @ 20" event. The fundraiser celebrates the museum's 20th anniversary and will take place on Saturday, Sept. 23. Tyler Potter, Marketing and Communications Specialist at the Racine Art Museum, joined us on Tuesday, Sept. 5 to preview the occasion. The event, now in its sixth year, is historically held at RAM's Wustum Museum, with this being the first year the event is being held at the Racine Art Museum. Guests will have the opportunity for behind-the-scenes experiences, along with the pairing of local artists and chefs to offer a unique blend of visual and culinary arts. Proceeds will partly benefit the involved artists and restaurants, while also funding RAM and Wustumâ€™s collection care and education outreach programs.
