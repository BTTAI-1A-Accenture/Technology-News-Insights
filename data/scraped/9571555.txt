So they would have like perhaps touched a wall or other portions of the home. And those and that is information that would be evidence for the investigation here to try to determine who killed his people," Williams said. View inside the house where the murders were committed.

The Moscow Police Department then provided a statement to Fox News on Thursday expressing that officials still believe the attack was targeted. "Our clarification last night directly addressed comments made by Latah County Prosecutor Thompson, who said the suspect(s) specifically looked at this residence, and that one or more of the occupants were undoubtedly targeted. We remain consistent in our belief that this was indeed a targeted attack but have not concluded if the target was the residence or its occupants," the statement read.
