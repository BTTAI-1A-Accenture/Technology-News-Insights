I think we’ll report on this at the end of the year, but I think we’re going to double the amount of districts we brought on compared to last year, which is really good news. And with that comes clumps of schools instead of single schools. It usually takes a little longer to get a [district on] [ph], but boy, they’re much bigger and you get big comps instead of onesies, twosies. And the retention so far has – in terms of the schools that are renewing is really good and strong, like it’s been historically. So, there’s a lot of momentum. The results we continue to get with our data and research is really strong. For example, we just did a big study on teacher retention and Leader in Me schools is significantly higher. And that’s become a big issue. So of course, we’re going to market that and get out with that message. But we’ve got – we’ve just got a lot of things in our favor right now, and we expect a solid fourth quarter. Was that [Multiple Speakers]. Alex Paris: No, absolutely. That’s what I was looking for. Thank you, Sean and good luck on the renewal season and good luck on the fourth quarter overall. Thanks for taking my question. Paul Walker: Thanks, Alex. Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will be a follow-up from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi: Yes. Thank you for the follow-up questions. I wanted to know your thoughts on the potential impact of generative AI on how you can impact your customers, as well as how it can impact your own employees? A little bit out of the question, but I appreciate your thoughts there. Paul Walker : That’s a great question. In fact, I was hoping somebody would ask. I considered making that kind of the fourth question I was going to answer proactively, but I thought, no, I won’t do that, that would be too many. So, we’re actually quite encouraged by the opportunity that generative AI is going to present for us and then you outlined it two ways. One, there’s an opportunity for us as we embrace this internally and how we work just to become even more efficient. We think that could be a real accelerant for us. We already have a really strong business financial operating model, but that ought to even help more in the future as we can unleash the power of generative AI to help us work more efficiently. I think that will be a big opportunity. I think the bigger opportunity actually might be with our clients. We’re working aggressively right now to; A, to watch this as quickly as we can, but to think about and figure out how to weave AI into our offerings. For example, we talk about being a content plus people plus technology company and that the integration of those three things are a differentiator and important as it relates to helping clients and people achieve behavior change and doing it at scale. The people component is really important. We don’t expect that’s going to go away, but the – part of the – I can imagine a day where that coaching, some of that coaching is, you have your AI, Franklin Covey coach in your pocket all the time. And with our acquisition of Jhana a few years ago, Jhana is that for a lot of people.
