 It's important to have a great antivirus software package that can protect your PC from threats while you browse online. Viruses, malware, ransomware, and phishing threats are all potential dangers when you're online, even if you think you're being careful. New threats are emerging every day, which is why many antivirus software manufacturers take a holistic approach, protecting your system from all kinds of potential threats, not just the obvious ones.  There are plenty of options out there so it's important to find the right one for you. While free apps are available, they typically offer fewer features. Generally, you get what you pay for, so it's important to purchase the right paid antivirus software. A dangerous virus or piece of ransomware can lock you out of your system. You could lose banking details, private documents, and personal photos that can never be recovered. Fortunately, if you install the right paid antivirus software, you won't have to worry.  There are a lot of options out there, but we've picked out nine packages that are the best around. Here's our pick for the best antivirus solutions: EDITOR'S NOTE: We've updated this story to remove Kaspersky, following plans for the US government to ban the software. Mashable will continue to monitor the situation, and update this story with any new developments. Over the years, Bitdefender has established quite the reputation for being exceptionally reliable when it comes to virus detection. That trend continues with Bitdefender Antivirus Plus. It's solidly dependable for the vast majority of its users.  In terms of its most basic features, it has a strong antivirus component, real-time behavioral monitoring for any pesky suspicious files, and ransomware protection. Scanning speeds are reasonably efficient with a quick scan taking a matter of seconds, and a full scan gradually taking less time the more you use it. For many, that's all you're ever going to need, but Bitdefender throws in a few more features along the way too — malicious website blocking, a password manager tool, and ransomware detection are also included. Overall, Bitdefender Antivirus Plus is the kind of software you can leave running in the background and it simply just works. It also doubles up well as a form of security suite, rather than simply a virus protection tool. Long gone are the days when households owned just one computer. Odds are that everyone in your home has their own PC or laptop, as well as a smartphone. Buy McAfee Total Protection once, and you'll have a license for all of these systems. It's possible to buy individual protection for half the price, but it's a poor value for any household with more than one device that needs protection. McAfee Total Protection isn't entirely foolproof but it's a well-priced solution for multiple devices. Its scan takes an average length of time compared to its competitors, but it does a solid job of detecting most threats. Similarly, the built-in firewall detects most threats automatically, without much need for you to tweak or fiddle around with any settings (unless you want to, of course). In all cases, McAfee Total Protection hardly slows down the system it's installed on, amply reminding you of why it's worth the investment. Being able to use one program across multiple devices is a huge help in simplifying security matters at home, and it's pretty effective too.  Creeping up on 30 years in the field, odds are everyone has used a Norton AntiVirus software tool at some point. Norton Antivirus Plus offers enhanced security for your devices and a VPN for online privacy. There are more than enough features here to beguile enthusiasts but potentially confuse novices.  That's immediately noticeable from the outset with Norton, which urges you to install not just the antivirus software, but multiple browser extensions. As part of its ability to protect you from dangerous search results, there's Norton Safe Search, along with Norton Toolbar, which assigns each site a safety rating, and Norton Identity Safe (its password management tool). Such a wealth of options continue throughout the software, which is why it can be a little confusing for some, albeit very secure.  Extra features include a smart firewall that monitors any potential unauthorized traffic, a SafeCam mode that detects if anyone tries to access your webcam, and the aforementioned Identity Safe password manager. Norton Antivirus Plus now comes with 2GB Cloud Backup as standard which can be useful. If you opt for the Standard Package, you also gain VPN protection. Avast Premium Security packs a lot in that makes it ideal for advanced users, but expensive for the average PC user. If you're okay with tweaking and fine-tuning everything possible, this is the solution for you. Fine-tuning is immediately demonstrated during the installation process. There are over a dozen different modular options to choose from, ranging from browser extensions to opting to install a password manager. You won't be left with unwanted features installed on your system.  Where Avast Premium Security really differs from its free alternative is the addition of Real Site, a secure DNS system that protects you from DNS hijacks. Essentially, it's an extra layer of protection against spoof websites. It scans sites to check they're legitimate so you can't be duped. These days, no antivirus software slows down the average PC drastically, but most of them can cause a negative impact on the performance of older PCs. Webroot Antivirus bucks that trend with a super small footprint, which means there's no reason not to install it, even if your computer has seen far better days. Occupying only about 15MB of disk space, Webroot AntiVirus takes predictably little time to install. Impressively, its system scan is also as speedy, taking less than a minute. Impressively, there's room for a sandbox feature too, an unusual addition for any antivirus package, that lets you run dubious programs in an isolated environment to see if they are actually worthy of your suspicion or not. The sole issue arises from the lack of independent test results for Webroot AntiVirus, but it's a relatively small issue in something that, anecdotally, has consistently garnered good results.  Built upon Sophos's business side of security products, Sophos Home Premium isn't the most user-friendly of tools, but if you know what you're doing and you're trying to help those who don't, it's good for the job. That's because everything is managed remotely via a web browser. Simply log into the Sophos dashboard, and you can see how everyone's device is doing. The main page offers information on the number of threats and websites blocked on that device, plus it allows you to implement some parental controls if you want.  Additionally, there's keylogger protection and a safe browser option for keeping you safe while checking your online banking. Unlike other virus protection software, Sophos extends things to include webcam protection too.  So, what's the downside? Sophos Home Premium is fairly unwieldy at times and a little intimidating given its wealth of options. More importantly, if you want to change a simple setting, you still need to dive into the remote management portal in your web browser, which makes it a less attractive proposition for one system use. Still, if you're the family's tech support, this is an ideal way of circumventing various common issues. A familiar name in the sector, Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security is a lot like the others, bar some very crucial new features. Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security approaches things a little differently than others, ensuring its ransomware detection is particularly effective.  Much of that is down to Trend Micro's Folder Shield component. It blocks all access to protected files by any program or app that isn't on your dedicated trusted list. By default, it covers the usual documents and pictures folders, but you can extend it to anything else of your choosing.  The addition of Mute mode pauses all Trend Micro Antivirus+-related activities as well as Windows Updates while you're otherwise preoccupied. Playing a game and don't want to be disturbed by a pop-up? This is where you go, and is exactly why Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security is so good for gamers.    G Data antivirus isn't the cheapest, but it has all the core elements you really need. There's a virus scanner with a high detection rate but more importantly, there's a strong behavioral monitor that can spot threats that may not have been discovered yet. Particularly potent at dealing with malware and ransomware, G Data antivirus also works well at protecting against exploits and monitoring your email for spam. Another neat feature is its USB Keyboard Guard which can protect against manipulated devices that may not be as they seem. It's unlikely this will be a common occurrence for the average user, but it's a nice extra for peace of mind. The only downsides are that it's a little demanding to set up, and doesn't have a super attractive interface, but the average user shouldn't have much trouble figuring it out.

 Macs are generally more secure than PCs but they're no longer impenetrable fortresses. If you have a Mac, it can still be useful to have an antivirus package for peace of mind. When it comes to phishing attempts in particular, antivirus software can really help — which is why we have a dedicated roundup of antivirus software just for Mac users. Viruses, malware, and ransomware are all bad, but there are subtle differences between each. Malware covers any software meant to cause harm to a computer. It can be innocuous but irritating like a pop-up ad or it can be as severe as hacking your webcam.Viruses are like malware in terms of reach but they self-replicate causing an 'infection' to your computer, hence its name. Viruses can be caught via email attachments, dangerous links, or even disguised pop-ups.  Ransomware is designed to block access to your system until a 'ransom' is paid. They're more likely to affect larger institutions but sometimes the average user can be caught out by such a problem. A good paid antivirus software tool can fight all three of these. If you use public networks regularly, you need a VPN. Many antivirus packages include one. Unsecured public networks are a hacker's dream, and we're surrounded by such networks every day from your local coffee shop to the airport or hotel you visit. Connecting to public networks requires no authentication, so hackers are easily able to get in and cause trouble. A VPN adds a level of encryption by having you connect to a secure server and giving you an extra layer of safety. By doing so, you can be kept safe from people eavesdropping on your browsing activities. Plus, they're great for watching exclusive Netflix offerings that are specific to other countries, as a little bonus. A lot of us do it: We repeat the same password for every single account we make, or at least some variation of that password. It's the most convenient option so you don't need to remember dozens of passwords at once — but it can be risky. If a hacker gains access to your main passwords, they can then get access to far more than just one account of yours. Use the same password for important accounts like your Amazon account or online banking, and you're in trouble. That's where a password manager comes in, and most antivirus software packages thankfully include them. A password manager stores all of your passwords in one place, saving you the need to remember them all. They even create strong ones for you, which makes it much harder for someone to access all your accounts (and protects you in case of data leaks by firms).
