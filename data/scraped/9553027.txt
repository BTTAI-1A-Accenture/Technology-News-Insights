They work behind the scenes and tackle some of the most demanding work imaginable, such as maintaining facilities and keeping them in tip-top condition. You can show your appreciation for deserving workers such as your favorite school custodians or office maintenance staff members in numerous ways, including these suggestions from Rubbermaid Commercial Products, supporters of cleaning and maintenance professionals nationwide. Write Thank You Notes In today’s digital world, handwritten notes are a novelty. The times may be changing, but the impression a thoughtful handwritten message leaves behind hasn’t changed at all. Keep a supply of blank notecards so you can offer notes to those who make a difference in your life. The sentiments don’t need to be long; a simple expression of gratitude is enough to brighten someone’s day. Participate in Appreciation EventsYou might receive information from local schools or businesses about opportunities to support maintenance staff, such as hosting meals or helping with cleanup in classrooms or offices. Finding opportunities to support underappreciated custodial staff can allow community members to show thanks in meaningful ways.  For example, Rubbermaid Commercial Products is hosting a Behind the Scenes of Clean Campaign this fall to elevate, recognize and thank cleaning and facility maintenance professionals who are among the first to arrive for work each day. The campaign includes more than 40 events globally where community members can engage with and personally thank custodians who are making an everyday difference behind the scenes. Recognize MilestonesOften, those in custodial roles blend into the fabric of everyday life. They’re rarely the focal point of celebrations, but often make it possible for others to honor special occasions. Make a point to know about the underappreciated professionals in your life, so you can recognize events like birthdays, work anniversaries and other dates that hold special personal meaning. Do Your PartThink about what small steps you can take to make unsung heroes’ jobs easier. That might mean picking up after yourself or cleaning up a mess in your workspace. It could involve wiping down your table after lunch. Little gestures can add up to a big difference. Lead By ExampleYou don’t need to wait for others to join you in recognizing workers whose impacts are made behind the scenes. Speaking up and taking action can serve as a positive example for those around you. You can even take the lead and organize an effort to recognize individuals who rarely receive thanks, such as the custodian at your office or the janitorial team at your favorite retailer.

 SunChips® Showcases Artwork from Underrepresented Artists in “Art Seen” Honors Experience Nickelodeon’s Food & Slime Festival at Resorts in Punta Cana & Riviera Maya  National Press Club Mourns the Loss of Bill Richardson, a Champion for Journalists Published on By Inflation remains one of the most discussed and misunderstood economic issues affecting the United States today. With rising prices impacting everything from grocery bills to gas stations, understanding the underlying causes, ongoing impacts, heresies and speculations, and possible solutions is essential. In this blog, we delve into the complexities of inflation and examine the role of government actions, particularly under the Biden Administration, in managing this economic challenge. Inflation can arise from several sources, categorized mainly into three types: demand-pull inflation, cost-push inflation, and built-in inflation. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to addressing inflation effectively, as each type may require different policy responses.  Today, the US economy faces inflation driven largely by post-pandemic economic recovery dynamics. Key factors include supply chain disruptions, increased consumer spending, substantial government stimulus measures, and global economic pressures. Each of these factors has combined in unique ways to push prices upward, albeit hopefully temporarily. A significant point of contention and speculation revolves around the concept that corporations are exploiting these turbulent times to increase prices disproportionately, thereby boosting profits at the expense of consumers. While businesses are indeed facing increased costs, the extent to which these are being passed on to consumers varies by industry and firm, leading to debates over potential price gouging. This raises an essential question: Are current inflation trends purely the result of macroeconomic factors, or are they exacerbated by strategic corporate pricing behaviors? The truth likely lies somewhere in between, reflecting the complex interplay of cost-driven pricing adjustments and market power. Addressing inflation requires a combination of monetary policy, fiscal adjustments, and targeted interventions. Under President Biden, the Inflation Reduction Act represents a broad policy measure ostensibly designed to tackle inflation by making long-term investments in energy infrastructure, healthcare, and tax reforms. While its name suggests an immediate reduction in inflation, its actual impacts are geared more towards future economic stability and growth. Furthermore, the administration can support the economy through social programs, wage supports, and direct financial aid, which can alleviate the burden on consumers and help stabilize demand. While inflation remains a pressing issue, it is clear that no single policy or action can completely address its varied causes. A balanced approach that includes responsible monetary policy, prudent fiscal management, and firm regulatory oversight is essential. Moreover, clear communication and strategic planning by the administration can help set realistic expectations and guide the economy toward a more stable future. In tackling inflation, understanding its roots, dispelling myths, and implementing a holistic strategy are vital steps forward for the Biden administration and other stakeholders. As we navigate these economic challenges, staying informed and engaged is crucial for all citizens. Understanding inflation involves a multi-faceted approach, taking into account economic theories, current events, and policy impacts. Here are some resources that can provide a well-rounded view of the ongoing discussions and analyses regarding inflation in the current US economy: By exploring these resources, you can gain a deeper insight into how inflation is currently affecting the US economy, what the potential future trends could be, and how policy decisions influence the economic outlook.

 Published on By  (Family Features) For teenagers, retirement may seem like a lifetime away, but it’s never too early to start saving for the future. Because financial habits can be created at a young age, the sooner kids begin to save and learn about investing, the less likely they’ll face worries about money when they eventually stop working. Teens are already thinking about retirement, according to the Achievement Teens & Retirement Survey conducted by Wakefield Research on behalf of Junior Achievement and MissionSquare Retirement’s Foundation. Among young adults ages 13-18 surveyed, 83% have thought about their retirement and 78% believe they’ll be able to retire comfortably when the time comes. However, only 60% view retirement as living on investments and savings after leaving work, believing instead retirement could mean taking extended time off for travel, study, illness or taking care of family matters.  “This research shows retirement is more top-of-mind for teens than one might think,” said Tim Greinert, president of Junior Achievement USA. “While young people have given retirement planning some thought, it’s apparent they still need information on the best way to go about it.” Because nearly half of U.S. households (46%) report having nothing saved for retirement, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances, taking steps early to save and invest can help teens get a head start on achieving a successful retirement. “The fact that so many young adults in the early stages of their careers are aware of a variety of investment strategies is encouraging news,” said Deanna Santana, president, MissionSquare Foundation. “Over the course of our lifetimes, investment approaches, the economy and our priorities will change, so planning for life after work is an ongoing necessity – for teens and adults alike.” Find more advice to plan for the future and achieve economic success at ja.org and missionsq.org.

 Published on By (Family Features) As the leaves begin to change and temperatures start to drop, it’s time to start thinking about preparing your home for the cooler months. With a few simple steps, you can ensure your haven of comfort stays warm, inviting and energy-efficient throughout fall and winter. Consider these home projects from the experts at Westlake Royal Building Products– a leader throughout North America in innovation, design and production of exterior and interior building products including siding, trim, mouldings, roofing, stone, windows, outdoor living and more – based on Zonda’s 2024 Cost vs. Value Report to get your home ready for the cooler seasons. Upgrade Your GarageNew garage doors typically come with energy-efficient features and advanced security measures but are also relatively low-cost updates compared to the significant perceived value and resale benefits. In fact, replacing a garage door boasts a 193% return on investment, according to the report. Pairing new garage doors with updated trim can also offer a tight seal from exterior elements such as wind, snow and water.  Insulate for a Warmer InteriorInsulated siding can play a crucial role in enhancing your home’s thermal performance. By providing an additional layer of protection, it helps reduce heat loss, ensuring your home remains warm and your energy bills stay manageable. Plus, according to the report, vinyl siding replacement has an 80.2% return on investment. An option like CraneBoard Solid Core Siding from Westlake Royal Building Products offers superior durability and insulation. Its solid core construction provides added strength and impact resistance while also contributing to better energy efficiency. In addition, the solid core reduces external noise and is designed to endure extreme weather conditions. Leak-Proof Your Home’s WindowsWindows can be substantial energy drainers and let warmth out when they’re not properly sealed. If you notice a draft coming in around your windows, sealing cracks or gaps with aesthetically pleasing trim can make a significant difference in keeping the heat in and chilly air out. For extreme drafts, consider replacing windows altogether, which can provide sellers with an average 67.1% return on vinyl window replacement, according to the report. Shield Your RoofYour roof is your home’s first line of defense against the elements. Check for damaged shingles or tiles and make necessary repairs to prevent leaks. If a roof replacement is needed – which provides a 56.9% return on investment using asphalt shingles, according to the report – consider incorporating a high-quality roofing underlayment to provide an extra layer of protection against water, heavy snow and ice. For example, Sol-R-Skin BLUE, an external insulating underlayment from Westlake Royal Building Products, complements steep slope roofing. This underlayment serves as a secondary water protective layer, energy-saving radiant barrier and above-deck roof insulation blanket that is all-in-one. It incorporates an anti-glare coating in cool blue, making it easier and safer to install than alternative shiny radiant barrier options.
