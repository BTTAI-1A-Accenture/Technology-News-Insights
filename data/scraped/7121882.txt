Former NBA superstar John Wall is reportedly drawing interest from the South East Melbourne Phoenix basketball team, according to Michael Randall from The Herald Sun. South East Melbourne Phoenix is an NBL team in Australia, and they have reportedly added Wall to their list of recruits for the upcoming season. Wall was a superstar with the Washington Wizards, making five All-Star teams and an All-NBA team during his time in Washington. Most recently playing with the LA Clippers, Wall appeared in 34 games with LA this past season, averaging 11.4 PPG and 5.2 APG in 22.2 minutes per contest. Wall was traded from the Clippers to the Houston Rockets, but never suited up for Houston before completing a buyout. Not signed after his release from the Rockets, Wall's time in the NBA may be coming to an end. The former star point guard has a minority stake in the South East Melbourne Phoenix basketball team, and is reportedly drawing interest from them ahead of their upcoming season. After his All-Star days with the Wizards, Wall spent time with the Houston Rockets during their rebuilding period, and showed flashes of his old self which led to the Clippers taking a chance on him this past summer. It unfortunately did not work out for Wall in LA, as he was dealt from the Clippers at the trade deadline after appearing in just 34 games.
