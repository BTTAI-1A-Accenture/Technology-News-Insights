The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is against the idea of removing the EDSA Bus Carousel, saying further study should be conducted before any action is taken. Chairman Romando Artes expressed opposition to the proposal of the Mega Manila Consortium and warned that bringing back passenger buses along the 23.8-km Epifanio de los Santos Avenue under the old system would cause traffic congestion. He said it is important to consider all factors before making decisions that could impact public transportation and the people who rely on it. Artes has pointed out that the EDSA Bus Carousel has been effective in moving commuters and has reduced traffic congestion along EDSA. “Commuter travel time along EDSA was cut in half because of the EDSA Bus Carousel,” the MMDA chief said. The government has already invested in the EDSA Bus Carousel and Bike Lane, and its stations are still being improved. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) has completed its Bike Master Plan and has continued to build infrastructure under the project. Artes stated that it is up to the DOTr to decide whether or not to remove the EDSA Bus Carousel. Reports showed that Mega Manila plans to reclaim the two outermost lanes of EDSA, which includes the bike lane, for buses. Additionally, the group is going to bring back the 14 bus stops that were previously removed along the thoroughfare. This could lead to some major changes in traffic flow and transportation options in the area. The government began operating the EDSA Busway project in July 2020 to complement the operations of Metro Railway Transit line 3 and its bus augmentation program. The project aims to help transport commuters in the National Capital Region and cut the travel time from Monumento to Paranaque Integrated Terminal Exchange from the usual 2 to 3 hours because of traffic, to just 45 minutes to 1 hour. © All Rights Reserved, Newspaper Theme.
