An investor conference call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, May 16, 2023 (see details below). All share and price per share information in this press release has been adjusted to reflect the Company's 1-for-20 reverse stock split, which was effective on February 6, 2023. Highlights for the three months ended March 31, 2023 Recent Developments Management Comments Stanton E. Ross, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Ally, stated, "We are very pleased to report nearly $7.7 million in quarterly revenues for the first quarter of 2023, along with an improved net income. We are pleased to see the continued success and traction in the marketplace with our new video products, particularly the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and QuickVu docking stations; which are continuing to build upon our existing subscription plans and deferred revenue. It is exciting to see our deferred revenue balance nearly double at the end of the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, as our contract liabilities went from about $5.0 million at March 31, 2022, to nearly $8.9 million at March 31, 2023. We continue to build excitement around the momentum being gained in our Digital Ally Healthcare venture, as Nobility Healthcare, LLC continues to right-size and maximizing the profitability of the four completed acquisitions. The numerous acquisitions we have already completed of medical billing companies demonstrates our roll-up strategy is effective and attractive to potential targets. We look forward to seeing the growth potential of this venture come to fruition and continue throughout 2023 and beyond." Ross added: "Additionally, we continue to be excited to maximize the profitability of the entertainment segment and have it grow organically with the kick of off our new Kustom 440 subsidiary. Kustom 440 hosted its first festival on Saturday, May 13, 2023, in Kansas City at Legends Field, headlining Chris Young and Gabby Barrett. We were very pleased with the results of the show and the turn-out for this event; we believe shareholders will benefit from the partnership between TicketSmarter and Kustom 440, along with their long-term value based on the multiples commanded by similar public companies in the market. We are continuing to right-size and adjust to the nuances of each new subsidiary, as we learn to navigate and effectively grow each of them. We will continue to inform our investors as we attempt to take advantage of new business opportunities and to maximize our existing business lines to benefit the Company and its shareholders through 2023 and beyond." 2023 Operating Results Total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7,697,190 and $10,294,781, respectively, a decrease of $2,597,591 (25%). Gross profit decreased 20% to $1,544,792 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 versus $1,939,619 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The overall decrease is attributable to the decrease in revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and a decrease in the overall cost of sales as a percentage of overall revenues to 80% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 from 81% for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7,717,598 and $8,742,957 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $1,025,359 (12%). The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in new sponsorships being entered into by the Company. We reported an operating loss of $6,172,806 and $6,803,338 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $630,532 (9%). Total other income increased to $193,227 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared to total other income of $105,096 for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in other income was largely attributable to the gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration promissory notes of $158,021 compared to a loss of $56,050 during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This is in connection with the four acquisitions made by our revenue cycle management segment. This gain was slightly offset by a decrease in interest income to $15,477 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, from $71,362 in the same period of 2022, which reflects our change in cash and cash equivalent levels in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. We reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $6,105,818, or $2.22 per share, and $6,600,148, or $2.59 per share, for the years three months March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No income tax provision or benefit was recorded in either 2023 or 2022 as the Company has maintained a full valuation reserve on its deferred tax assets.
