Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said while leading the Bharat Jodo Yatra, he has learnt a lot. He said he also realised that like him, lakhs of people in India have put up 'Mohabbat ki dukaan'. Rahul's Bharat Jodo Yatra received a warm welcome as it entered Jammu from the adjoining Samba district Monday afternoon with authorities further strengthening the security cordon around him.
