Kaching! Kaching! Zoo Pals! The classic animal themed plates have returned to make lunchtime fun again for a new generation of children and give adults a taste of nostalgia. After being discontinued in 2014, Hefty announced the relaunch of Zoo Pal paper plates Thursday, featuring 10 of the classic colorful animal designs. The household products company revealed consumers did not hesitate to purchase them, having sold out on Amazon. Hefty added that there is currently no date for when the product will be available on Amazon again. "Thank you so much for all of your love and support for Zoo Pals™ Plates on the relaunch!" Hefty wrote. "We're working quickly to restock." Part of the design's appeal is that the plates also have segmented ears or feet to separate meals, snacks or dips. The animal character options include: The plates are also soak-resistant, microwave safe and made with sustainably sourced paper, according to Hefty. "Oink oink, buzz buzz, and quack quack your way through parties, playdates, and snacktime, while making cleanup a breeze!" Hefty wrote. By Sunday, the plates should be available for purchase on Target's website. Wendy's breakfast menu new addition:New English muffin sandwiches debut this month
