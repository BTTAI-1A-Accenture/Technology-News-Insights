San-Francisco based company Prologis, which has built several warehouses in the Portland area -- including this one in Northeast Portland -- is planning to construct a massive distribution center at a former Kmart site across from Parkrose High School.

Dave Killen / The Oregonian School leaders and neighbors in outer Northeast Portland who oppose a proposed distribution center at a former Kmart site are demanding Portland pass an emergency moratorium on large warehouses. The request comes as residents and the Parkrose School District have unsuccessfully fought a proposal by San Francisco-based developer Prologis to build a large concrete freight distribution center just opposite Parkrose High School’s athletic fields and student street crossings. The design calls for 37 truck loading bays. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
