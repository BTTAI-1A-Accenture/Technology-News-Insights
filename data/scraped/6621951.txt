LAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / October 12, 2023 / CLS Holdings USA, Inc. (OTCQB:CLSH)(CSE:CLSH), (the 'Company' or 'CLS'), a diversified cannabis company operating as Cannabis Life Sciences, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2023 ("Q1 2024"). All amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars. Q1 2024 Financial & Operational Highlights Weathering the Market Waves In a landscape marked by substantial market-wide downturn, it is noteworthy to recognize that CLS Holdings stands resilient. While the industry faces heavy challenges and a tough few quarters ahead, the Company has not seen a precipitous market drop and continues to manage and meet many of its goals and objectives. Despite industry-wide downfalls, we continue to see a steady flow of customers at Oasis as well as persistent sales across our branded product divisions. It's evident that consumer spending patterns have evolved. Covid funds have ended, and inflation is rising- it's no secret that consumers have less money to spend. But people still want to feel good; people still need their medicine," said Andrew Glashow, CEO of CLS Holdings. "Instead of buying fewer items, people are buying just as many but are now gravitating towards cheaper options. We believe factors such as our new VIP loyalty program, marketing initiatives, and connection to the community have allowed us to retain customers and continue to offer them affordable options."  Fostering Growth Through Strategic Renovation In the fiscal quarter ended August 31, 2023, the Company comprehensively evaluated operations, sales and marketing strategies, allowing it to evolve its formulations and processes to remain ahead of the competition. CLS Holdings' small size, encompassing a single retail store and manufacturing facility, affords it the advantage of making nimble adjustments that have a significant impact on operations and cash flow despite an unrelenting competitive and regulatory landscape. The Fruit of the Initiatives The investments and strategic refinements undertaken show tangible results indicative of a forward trajectory. Though CLS Holdings revenue is down 15% over the past year, the Company is still up 40-50% since the Covid-19 pandemic. Implementations like the VIP loyalty program, powered by Springbig, and Pluggi, an AI-powered chatbot product recommender, have shown promising increases in basket size and spending. The average price of products added as a result of Pluggi's recommendation is $32, making for a 28% increase in the average shopping cart value at Oasis, with approximate basket spend per transaction reaching an impressive $45. Since implementing Pluggi, Oasis has seen approximately a $17,000 monthly increase in revenue against a relatively low annual cost of $2,500. Further, the VIP loyalty program has seen hundreds of sign-ups in just a few months, increasing cash flow, as well as customer satisfaction and retention. CLS continues on its track of paying off 150K - 200K of debt per month with the goal of reaching profitability in the 2024 fiscal year. With the restructuring of our debt, the Company will save 600K in annual interest payments over the next 9 months and is on pace to be substantially debt free by the end of calendar year 2024. Management Commentary "In an industry that never lets up, we acknowledge that while we may be down 15% over the past year, we are proud of our achievements to date. With a small and nimble approach, we have and continue to pivot to navigate the market's current realities. We remain resolute in our pursuit of continuous growth and recognize that the support from our loyal customers and dedicated team is what keeps Oasis at the forefront of Nevada's cannabis industry," said Andrew Glashow, Chairman and CEO. "We anticipate that, just like those who opt for more budget-friendly options during economic downturns, our customers continue to find solace in our range of offerings, including many affordable choices, like our own City Trees products. We continue to focus on areas of strength and asset-light opportunities while cutting ties with underperforming or non-strategic pursuits," Glashow adds. Outlook The Nevada market alone is expected to grow 33% between 2020 and 2025, reaching $1 billion in sales by 2025. While nearby markets like Arizona and New Mexico are expected to hit $3.1 billion in sales by 2025 collectively. The Company is exploring asset-light approaches in these attractive markets, including potential joint ventures, brand licensing agreements, and wholesale distribution. Further, the Company has obtained a prospective consumption lounge license with plans to open the space in 2024 assuming final licensing approval. CLS Holdings is strategically positioned for sustainable growth and reaching its planned goals.
