REGINA, SK, Feb. 28, 2023 /CNW/ - Despite progress in recent decades, gender equality in Canada remains a pressing issue. Indigenous women and girls as well as Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people face unique and complex challenges as they strive for equal opportunities in social, economic, educational, and political life. Today, the Honourable Marci Ien, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth, announced up to $4 million for eight organizations to advance gender equality in Saskatchewan. These organizations include:   By supporting Indigenous women and girls that are at the heart of their communities, the Government of Canada continues to create a safer and more equitable society for all. Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people continue to face disproportionate levels of violence and abuse, including physical, sexual, and emotional violence, as well as exploitation and trafficking. Some of these projects also enable the organizations to address the root causes of gender-based violence and ensure that Indigenous women and their communities can prosper now and in the future. Without addressing gender-based violence, we cannot have gender equality.

The organizations' work will ensure that all individuals ? including Indigenous women; girls; and Two-Spirit, sexually diverse, and gender-diverse people ? can live in a society where their rights are protected, their voices are heard, and their contributions are valued."
