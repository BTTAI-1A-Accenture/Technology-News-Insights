Louise Thomas Editor On Monday, December 25, millions around the world will celebrate Christmas Day.  Every year, the holiday, which celebrates the birth of Jesus, is celebrated on the 25th of December. This year, the religious holiday falls on a Monday, which means that those who celebrate, and many other employees, will receive the day off.  First introduced by Congress in 1885 when it was decided that federal employees should have certain days off from work, the list of US federal holidays is made up of 11 days of significance that Americans recognise - and celebrate. To ensure that these holidays are observed, certain guidelines have been put in place, with federal holidays that fall on a Saturday observed by federal employees on the previous Friday, while holidays that fall on Sunday are observed the following Monday. On these 11 days, all non-essential federal offices are closed, while banks, post offices and schools may also be closed. However, that doesn’t mean that all Americans will receive a day off from work, as employees in the private sector may or may not get the day off, depending on their employer. From Memorial Day to Thanksgiving, these are the dates of the 2023 federal holidays.
