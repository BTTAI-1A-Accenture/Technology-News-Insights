The significant technological advances being made in the automobile industry, namely the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, are bound to have an impact on another sector: the auto insurance sector. These changes result in different customer needs and demands, which means that auto insurers will have to adapt to the times if they wish to stay relevant in this modern technological era. According to Ernst & Young, evolving mobility trends, telematics, and customer expectations are now beginning to challenge the legacy business models put forth by auto insurance companies. These challenges are forcing these companies to change the way they work and the type of work they do if they wish to adapt to a shrinking market size. Ernst & Young believes that by 2035, the changes felt in mobility trends, telematics, and customer expectations will shrink the market available to auto insurance companies by 31%. They are also expected to bring in newer competition, especially against older and more traditional insurers, while also transforming the way insurance is distributed, underwritten, and serviced. In light of these factors, financial professionals today see insurance companies, and even companies like Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), Metlife, Inc. (NYSE:MET), and The Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL), that offer a diverse range of insurance products, as going through a radical transformation during the next few years. Ernst & Young recommends that insurance carriers should begin to act now and fast to build business-to-business (B2B) distribution partnerships while also maximizing the benefits of telematics for their own gain. According to an article published by McKinsey in September, three major technologies will change the way the auto insurance sector operates in the next few years. These technologies, namely autonomous driving, connectivity, and embedded telematics, are said to be responsible for shaping the future of mobility and global auto insurance. McKinsey believes that not only will these technologies result in changing dynamics within the auto insurance industry, but they will also result in the same for original equipment manufacturers. The impact of these new technologies on original equipment manufacturers relates to the increased access these companies will have to their customers and to vehicle data. This increased access also means that disintermediate insurers would be placed at a disadvantage in comparison to original equipment manufacturers. However, the article also notes that those insurance companies that manage to capitalize on insurance based on real-time vehicle usage can also be at a significant advantage if they play their cards right. It cannot be disputed that new technologies that have made autonomous driving a real-life possibility today will have a significant impact on the auto insurance sector, and this impact may not be entirely positive. With more people opting for autonomous or self-driving cars, the frequency of car accidents is expected to decrease drastically. In light of this development, auto insurance is beginning to move towards becoming a “predict and prevent” product, according to the McKinsey article. Another key point from the article that is worth noting is that with the rise of autonomous vehicles, insurance liability is also being shifted from human operators to commercial parties that are responsible for the manufacture of autonomous vehicles and their technology. All of the above shows only the beginning of the impact the auto insurance industry is bound to feel in the face of these new technological advancements. The way these advancements affect the sector is bound to show within the general performance of the property and casualty insurance sector at large. This is a sector that we have covered in another article before, where we highlight current dynamics within the sector and the growth it has been exhibiting. It is worth noting that despite skepticism surrounding the auto insurance industry today in light of the changing dynamics we have mentioned above, there is also a significant degree of widespread optimism among the financial public when it comes to the property and casualty insurance sector. Keeping this in mind, we felt that it would be worth compiling a list of the biggest auto insurance companies in the US today.
