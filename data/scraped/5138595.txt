We've been asking ourselves recently if the market has placed a fair valuation on CVS Health. Let's dive into some of the fundamental values of this large-cap Consumer Staples company to determine if there might be an opportunity here for value-minded investors. CVS Health Corporation provides health services in the United States. The company belongs to the Consumer Staples sector, which has an average price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.36 and an average price to book (P/B) ratio of 4.29. In contrast, CVS Health has a trailing 12 month P/E ratio of 32.3 and a P/B ratio of 1.25. CVS Health's PEG ratio is 1.88, which shows that the stock is probably overvalued in terms of its estimated growth. For reference, a PEG ratio near or below 1 is a potential signal that a company is undervalued.  CVS Health has a pattern of improving cash flows, healthy debt levels, and average operating margins with a stable trend. However, the firm suffers from slimmer gross margins than its peers and declining EPS growth. Finally, we note that CVS Health has weak revenue growth and a flat capital expenditure trend.
