Here are your best smartphone options under Rs 60,000 in India this month The category of phones in the 50K to 60K price bracket in India hasnât seen too many newcomers this quarter. As a result, there has been little churn in our list of phones under Rs 60,000 this time as compared to the last. Of course, the price of certain handsets has dropped significantly since then, and the Apple iPhone 13 has headed in the opposite direction and out of this budget. Time to jump straight into the action and look at who made the cut this month. Best phones to buy under Rs 60,000 in India OnePlus 11 5G Letâs start with two of the most powerful phones around with almost identical model numbers. The OnePlus 11 5G is the best all-around phone from the company at the moment. It is loaded with a lot of features generally reserved for the Pro variant. The phone feels great in hand and has a 6.7-inch curved LTPO3 AMOLED display with a resolution of 3216 x 1440 pixels. This HDR10+ and Dolby Vision-compliant screen supports 10-bit colour depth, 120 Hz variable refresh rate and can get up to 1300 nits bright. The phone runs OxygenOS 13 based on Android 13 and one can expect several OS and security updates in the future.Â Â  The OnePlus 11 5G is powered by Qualcommâs latest flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, and you get its 8 GB RAM and 128 GB UFS 3.1 storage variant in this budget. The rear camera department is loaded, starting with a 50MP primary camera with OIS and Hasselbladâs colour tuning. The support cast is equally impressive with a 48MP ultrawide camera with auto-focus that also doubles up as a macro camera and a 32MP telephoto camera with 2X optical zoom. Its 5000 mAh battery easily lasts for a day and a half of moderate use, and the bundled 100W charger juices it up in under 30 minutes. Pro tip: With the right credit card, you can get its top variant with 16 GB RAM and 256 GB UFS 4.0 storage under Rs 60,000 effectively. OnePlus 11 5G price in India:
