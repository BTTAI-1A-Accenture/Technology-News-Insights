   Critics of Moms for Liberty did not mince words about how they felt about the parental rights nonprofit at its annual summit in Philadelphia this past weekend. Video shows protesters wishing for harm against attendees and using dehumanizing language to describe them for opposing what attendees consider age-inappropriate curricula for children, particularly regarding gender and sexuality. "We know you're afraid of us because you're obsolete," one protester wielding a bullhorn says in a large group sporting LGBTQ and transgender-specific flags. "There's no world that includes you because of your bigotry and your hatred in it. You don't belong here, you never did and you never will." In contrast to the protesters who love, support and protect each other, Moms for Liberty and their supporters are "cockroaches" who "scatter" when critics call out their purported lies, the protester says. She hoped that attendees would be afflicted by bedbugs on their Philadelphia trip and that the bedbugs would be disgusted by them. It wasn't the only reported invocation of bedbugs against Moms for Liberty. Another chant uses misogynistic language against attendees, calling them "hoes for Hitler." The annual summit ended Sunday but video of protesters continued to be posted Tuesday.
