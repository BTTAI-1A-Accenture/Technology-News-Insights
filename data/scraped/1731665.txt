In contrast, in China, 80% of online purchases are driven by personalized recommendations.

The next generation of consumers will expect a highly personalized shopping experience where products nd them instead of the other way around.” Kate Hardcastle MBE, The Customer Whisperer and independent expert, added: “Retail and shopping trends have evolved signicantly over the last decade and it’s clear there are more changes to come.

Klarna’s latest research shows that consumers want greater convenience and a more personalised shopping experience – and seamless technology must be at the heart of this.” ChatGPT, the articial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, commented: “The biggest change for consumers when they shop in 2041 will likely be the widespread use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, allowing them to virtually try on products and experience them before making a purchase. Additionally, personalized recommendations based on their past behavior and preferences will become even more accurate and prevalent, making shopping experiences more efcient and tailored to individual needs.” Stay Informed, keep up to date!
