Hello Tuesday Gretchen Parsons here with your morning read.
Good morning. A locally-owned pizza joint just opened its third location, details below. But first, in the near future, it could cost money to visit Jump Creek Falls.
The Spirit of Boise Balloon Classic is happening in Ann Morrison Park from Wednesday through Sunday. Yesterday morning I stated the wrong park, my apologies!

Today: 94° ☀️ 🌩Sunny then possible t-storms

Jump Creek fees

Land managers are considering adding fees to access a popular recreation site distinguished by its 60-foot waterfall in Owyhee County.
The Bureau of Land Management is proposing a day-use fee of $5 per vehicle at Jump Creek Falls, or $25 for an annual pass. The BLM is also evaluating making Jump Creek a day-use-only site and eliminating camping.
In a news release, the BLM says operational and maintenance costs at the site have nearly doubled in the past six years, as an estimated 40,000 visitors visit Jump Creek annually. Along with maintenance, the fees would also go toward offsetting law enforcement patrols and rescues, and any excess money would be carried over annually for improving infrastructure and adding amenities wanted by visitors.
The fees would be implemented this year, with fixed prices through 2032.
The BLM is seeking public comment on the proposal through September 28. Comments can be emailed to [email protected]. You can read more about the proposal here.
It’s currently free to access Jump Creek Falls. The area is open to special-use permit camping, hiking, fishing, swimming, panning, and rock climbing.




Ruszoni’s opens in Caldwell

A local pizza joint has expanded to Caldwell.
Ruszoni’s Pizza just opened at 313 Isaiah Way, which is in the same building as the Great Floors business.
Along with pizza, Ruszoni’s also has breadsticks and wings, different sandwiches like the Chicken Bacon, and a three-tier salad bar. There are also beers and cider on tap.
Inside, the Caldwell location has different arcade games, tables and chairs, along with bar seating. It’s open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, until 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, and from noon to 8 p.m. on Sunday.
Ruszoni’s first opened in Weiser 30 years ago, according to its website. There’s another location in downtown Meridian that has a rooftop patio.
