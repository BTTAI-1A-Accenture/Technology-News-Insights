The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has announced the birth of a new baby mandrill. The baby girl monkey, who is yet unnamed, was born in the early morning hours of June 6 to Hasina (mother) and Mosi (father), the zoo announced Sunday announcement on its Facebook page. The zoo's Congo Expedition team reports the baby mandrill is "doing great, strong and curious about her new world," adding that Hasina is a "very attentive and picture-perfect, first-time mom." Malaika, Hasina's sister, has been allowed to groom the baby, who is a half-sister of Bernard, the zoo reports. Mandrills are the largest of all monkeys, and are native to rainforests along the equator in west central Africa. They are very colorful with red and blue skin. Baby mandrills are independent primates that nurse, sleep and — when allowed by their mothers — will begin to move off their mothers for brief periods to explore within days of birth, the zoo reports. They learn by observing their mother and other troop members. The baby girl, Hasina and the rest of the mandrill troop can be seen when they access their public-facing habitate, the zoo says, but there are times the mandrills will choose to stay behind the scenes.
