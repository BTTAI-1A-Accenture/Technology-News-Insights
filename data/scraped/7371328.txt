Sure, Halloween may be months away, but if you take your holiday decor seriously, you know it's never too early to start scouring. HomeGoods shoppers have already noticed the home decor giant has begun stocking its online store, as well as some of its retail locations, with Halloween goodies. Of the new drops, eagle-eyed fans noticed a particularly standout item from years past has made a welcome return: the viral ghost blanket spotted in HomeGoods, TJ Maxx, and Marshalls stores.   Similar to the ever-popular ghost rug, this decorative throw from Rachel Zoe's home collection was all over TikTok and Instagram in July and August 2022, and appears to have resurfaced recently. Shoppers started noticing it was listed online about a week ago, though it's no longer available on the HomeGoods website. One TikToker, @kristinnicolemiller_, shared her Halloween finds from the store on June 23, which included the ghost blanket and two adorable ghost-shaped pillows.   Embroidered with little ghosts throughout, the blanket measures 50 by 60 inches and comes in three different colorways: black, white, and a colorful option featuring green, orange, yellow, and pink ghosts against a white backdrop. While its original price tag sits around $25, the blanket has become so coveted that sellers on Mercari, Poshmark, and eBay have listed — and sold — the item for upwards of $100.   Though some shoppers have already snagged the famous throw, based on previous years, it's likely to continue popping up in stores and be restocked online throughout the summer. Take a closer look at the sought-after decor piece ahead, and good luck hunting for your own.
