Latest Synthesia, a software company co-founded by Prof. Matthias Niessner, has reached unicorn status with a valuation exceeding $1 billion. The start-up, founded in 2017 by Prof. Niessner, a visual computing professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), in collaboration with a researcher from University College London and two companies, utilizes artificial intelligence to simplify video content production. Using AI avatars, users can easily create learning videos without requiring specialized skills or equipment. The avatars, designed to mimic real actors with convincing facial expressions and voices, offer adaptability and flexibility through a range of video templates. To address ethical concerns and prevent deepfakes, Synthesia diligently inspects videos for misinformation, unintentional distortions, and any unauthorized representation of individuals. Following a successful financing round securing $90 million, Synthesia achieved unicorn status, signifying a valuation surpassing $1 billion without an initial public offering. The company, headquartered in London, boasts 200 employees and additional locations in Munich, Copenhagen, New York, and Amsterdam, and has garnered a substantial customer base of prominent companies. Prof. Matthias Niessner's research focus at TUM centers on visual computing, where he utilizes machine learning methods to process and analyze 3D models of real environments, aiming to create virtual worlds indistinguishable from reality. Additionally, he developed FaceForensics software, aiding in the detection of video manipulation in the online sphere. TUM has fostered several unicorns and decacorns, including Celonis, Lilium, and Personio, with approximately 70 technology-oriented companies founded at the university annually. As one of Europe's leading deep tech ecosystems, TUM continues to contribute to groundbreaking innovations in the tech industry.
