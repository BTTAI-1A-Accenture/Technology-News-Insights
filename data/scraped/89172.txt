Independent Audit Verifies AdvicePay's Internal Controls and Processes BOZEMAN, Mont., Jan. 12, 2023 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- AdvicePay, the leading fee-payment-processing platform designed exclusively for financial advisors, today announced that it has completed its SOC 2 Type II audit, performed by KirkpatrickPrice. This attestation provides evidence that AdvicePay has a strong commitment to security and to delivering high-quality services to its clients by demonstrating that they have the necessary internal controls and processes in place. A SOC 2 audit provides an independent, third-party validation that a service organization's information security practices meet industry standards stipulated by the AICPA. During the audit, a service organization's non-financial reporting controls as they relate to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system are tested. The SOC 2 report delivered by KirkpatrickPrice verifies the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of AdvicePay's controls to meet the standards for these criteria. "AdvicePay is pleased to have successfully completed the SOC 2 Type II examination and audit. We take security very seriously, and it is imperative that the financial professionals who use our product can trust us to operate at the highest standards of security and compliance," said Mary Moore, Chief Operating Officer at AdvicePay.
