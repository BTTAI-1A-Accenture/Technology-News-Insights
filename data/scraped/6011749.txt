            3mins The 24 teams that will take part in Sky Bet League One in the 2023/24 season were confirmed at the end of May.  Here, dcfc.co.uk will take a look at each one in focus ahead of the new campaign getting underway at the start of August. In this instalment, the team we opened the 2022/23 season against at Pride Park Stadium, Oxford United, are in the spotlight.  Established: 1893 Nickname: The U’s Home: Kassam Stadium (12,500 capacity) Manager: Liam Manning 2022/23 finish: 19th (Sky Bet League One) Established in 1893 as Headington Football Club, it wasn’t until 1960 when they adopted the name Oxford United having also been called Headington United before that.  They joined the Football League in 1962 and by 1986 they were playing in the First Division following successive promotions between 1984 and then.  Their good form continued in that era as they won the 1986 League Cup in convincing fashion after a 3-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers. Oxford were relegated from the top-flight in 1988 and a steep decline from then saw them drop out of the EFL and into the Conference in 2006 – becoming the first winners of a major trophy in England to do so. They spent four seasons out of the league before earning promotion back to League Two in 2010. In 2016 they were then promoted back into the third tier and have remained there since then.                George Thorne  Midfielder George Thorne joined the Rams in the summer of 2014 following a successful loan spell from West Bromwich Albion. Thorne battled several long-term injuries during his time in Derbyshire but was always a mainstay in the side when fit and a popular figure with supporters. After six years with Derby, Thorne joined the U’s in January 2020 but was released the following summer. Mark Wright  Former England international defender Mark Wright started his professional career with Oxford in 1980 before earning a move to Southampton at just 18-years-old. An incredibly successful spell on the south coast saw him earn an international call-up for England and in 1987 the Rams acquired his services after securing a return to the top tier. He continued to be a mainstay in the England set-up during his time in Derbyshire and made 144 appearances for the Rams across a four-year spell before transferring to Liverpool in 1991. Curtis Nelson  One of Derby's summer additions had a successful spell with Oxford between 2016 and 2019. He helped the U’s to Wembley in the EFL Trophy during his time there and was named captain for the many of his 121 appearances.          There’s no denying that last season was one that fell well below par for Oxford. A 1-0 loss against the Rams at Pride Park Stadium on opening day last July set up what was a campaign of struggle and one that saw them finish just above the bottom four in 19th spot. They parted comapny with Head Coach Karl Robinson in February after picking up just one point in eight games and he was replaced by former MK Dons manager Liam Manning as he guided them to safety.  The 2022/23 season marked just the 11th and 12th time respectively that the Rams had faced off with Oxford in competitive action.  Derby managed to do the double over the U’s in the last campaign after the 1-0 victory on the opening day, secured by a late goal from Conor Hourihane, was followed up by a 3-2 victory at the Kassam Stadium in March with Louie Sibley scoring twice.   Historically the Rams have six victories to Oxford’s four with the other two games ending in draws. The two have never faced each other in a major cup competition.
