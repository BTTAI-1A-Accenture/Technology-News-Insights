In the clip, Avinash Sachdev can be heard saying that Elvish Yadav was after his coffee to which Elvish replied, “Arey to de deta na bhai. Abey leke chal na apni coffee, room mein jake pi (so you could have given me the coffee. Now go and have it in your room).” Avinash shooed him leading Elvish to calling him ‘bewakoof ka bachcha.” 

Avinash heard Elvish saying this and fumed in anger. He screamed, “Ae baap pe mat ja.” Elvish further replied, “Tere ko pata lag gya bewakoof hi hai wo (so you know he is a fool).” The actor once again said, “Kaiko bol raha hai bewakoof ka bachha, maine tujhe kuch kaha (why are you calling me son of a fool, did I say something)?” Elvish replied, “Tu bhi bol le... lakin tu hain. Mein teen baar aur bolunga (you can also call me that…but you are one. I will repeat it three more times).” 


All the housemates were asking Elvish Yadav to stop and calm down in the video. The audience, however, couldn’t stop laughing at Avinash’s reaction. 

One of the comments read, “correct tag for Avinash.” Another wrote, “who can bring fun even while fighting, that is Elvish.” Another comment read, “he said nothing wrong.” Another wrote, “Now it looks like BB has started.” Another commented, “someone teach Avinash the meaning of it.” 

Meanwhile, recently the host of the show, Salman Khan announced an extension to the season by two weeks. The contestants nominated this week are Bebika Dhurve, Falaq Naazz, Pooja Bhatt, Avinash Sachdev, and Manisha Rani who will be fighting to survive in the show.
