Oyo State Government has advised civil servants in the State to beware of scammers. It advised the people of the State, especially civil servants and students, to ignore an online platform asking them to fill a purported application form to benefit from the State Government’s N10,000 support for them. Segun Ogunwuyi, Chief of Staff to the Governor, described the report as fake. Ogunwuyi, who doubles as Chairman of the 15-man Sustainable Action for Economic Recovery (SAfER) in the statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday, said his committee was already working hard on the Governor’s relief packages. “The food palliative to 200,000 vulnerable households; 100,000 free healthcare insurance supports for our people; N500 million for deserving farmers under food security; another N500 million for SMEs, amongst other palliatives, are on course to mitigate the sufferings of the masses following subsidy removal,” he said.
