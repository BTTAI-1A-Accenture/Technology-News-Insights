Seema Chaturvedi, Founder and Managing Partner, AWE Funds                         In recent years, a groundbreaking development has been transforming the landscape of investment: The rise of gender-smart funds. These funds, driven by the principles of gender equality and social impact, are revolutionizing the way we think about finance. By incorporating a gender lens into investment decisions, gender-smart funds seek to address the persistent gaps and inequalities faced by women, while simultaneously generating financial returns. These are investment vehicles that are designed to channel capital into businesses and initiatives that promote gender equality, women’s empowerment, and social inclusion. It operates on the principle that integrating gender considerations into investment strategies can lead to enhanced financial performance, improved risk management, and more sustainable and equitable outcomes.  Serious inequities exist in accessing opportunities for economic growth is widely documented. Statistics that capture the outcomes of such an unlevel playing field are powerful but often overlooked measures. When labor participation of women is lagging that of men (World Bank estimates ~23% for women versus ~71% for men); when access to capital is significantly distorted; when venture funding of women is less than 2% of the overall funding, it requires all to take stock. It requires a concerted and intentional effort to invest proactively in women. Dismissing this intentionality off as a ‘quota’ is underappreciating the real issues at hand and undervaluing the impact potential of such focus. The economic imperatives are equally or in some cases even more strong.  A recent analysis in November 2022 of 105 unicorns (companies with market cap greater than $1 Billion) highlights that 20% of these companies have women founders or co-founders.  This is not limited to just one datapoint; There are several such indicators that point to significantly increased return on investments (RoI) when there is gender diversity. Studies have indicated that the RoI can be as much as 35% higher in a gender diverse company. Additionally, as consumer spending shifts in the control of women, there is a massively unexplored or underexplored addressable market. Companies that provide products and services to these markets will have serious first mover advantages. Finally, companies that include gender diverse supply chains are known to have dependable, efficient business models. While the growth and impact of gender-smart funds are encouraging, there are still challenges to address. Limited access to gender-disaggregated data, the need for standardized measurement frameworks, and the prevalence of unconscious biases within investment decision-making processes are among the hurdles to overcome. However, these challenges present opportunities for collaboration, research, and the development of innovative solutions that can further advance gender-smart investing. The two primary ideas of non-believers of gender smart funds are  of multiple variants; One, we do not need to back women just because they are women and that female founders do not need or want to be given preferential treatment. Two, we will not find enough women founders to back to have a viable venture fund. Both these reasons were and still are based on a very narrow definition of what the real issues are and how one should solve them. One needs to have the patience and the willingness to understand the real underlying moral and economic imperatives.’ Starting with the moral imperative first; when half the population does not have the same access to the same set of opportunities as the other half does, it is not a matter of equality. It is a matter of equity. This is a very nuanced yet poorly understood notion. Women  are seeking equity – which is equal access to opportunities. Linking  it to having a short person and a tall person being given a ladder of the same height, to reach top shelf opportunities. Depending on the height of the top shelf, chances are the short person will not be able to access those opportunities. What can change this access for the short person? Clearly, a taller ladder. Gender-smart funds are emerging as a powerful force for positive change in the investment world. With a focus on promoting gender equality, empowering women, and driving social impact, these funds harness the potential of finance to address critical social issues. “The world is finally waking up to the potential of what I call, ‘the most potent but still latent resource in an economy – it’s women.’”     Views expressed above are the author's own.
