   A 20-member youth board has been established by the European Union (EU) delegation in Uganda to advance the youth agenda on a local and global scale.The EU Youth Sound Board (YSB) comprises young people, including leaders and university students from various parts of the nation between the ages of 23 and 30 years.According to EU ambassador to Uganda Jan Sadek, advancing Uganda's interests can only be done by interacting or paying attention to many perspectives from the private sector, the government, civil society, and the media, among others.He observed that there is now a structure in place that allows young people to connect in their discussions on various subjects and to comprehend their needs and what needs to be done.Sadek pointed out that the 20-member board brings a diversified expertise and engagement covering the keys areas, including governance, gender, education, the environment, climate change, skills development and employment and health, all of which are important to their partnership with Uganda. “Youth empowerment is a top priority for the EU. The EU believes that young people must be involved in shaping and implementing its external action,” he added.He emphasized that the YSB's goal is to actually alter how the EU interacts with young people both globally and locally.The European Union (EU) Youth Sound Board being innaugurated at the EU Ambassador to Uganda's Resident in Kololo, Kampala.

In this context, the European Union Delegation to Uganda has established a YSB to strengthen engagement and dialogue with Ugandan youth and to advise on the relevance and effectiveness of its actions and development cooperation with Uganda,” Sadek added.He noted that the board members are a highly qualified group which was selected in a competition of 170 young people in the country.“I can tell you this YSB is full of energy, ideas and ambition, and we look forward to working with you during the coming two years and possibly beyond,” he noted.He further disclosed that a young Ugandan: John Jessy Nabundesi was chosen from among 4,500 applicants from 150 different nations to join the 25-member global EU YSB.Sadek said YSB members will participate in their individual capacity and will be serving a mandate of two years and meet on a quarterly basis.They will advise the EU on issues related to youth empowerment and participation in development processes.“The YSB will serve as a knowledge hub for the EU in Uganda to exchange information and share ideas on youth issues. The Youth Sounding Board will also benefit from capacity-building activities such as leadership, advocacy and networking,” he added.Good start for a stable futureWhile launching the board at the EU Ambassador’s residence in Kololo, Kampala, on August 31, 2023, State Minister for Youths and Children Affairs Sarah Mateke remarked that listening to young people's voices is a good start to having a stable future.“For the youth of Uganda, I believe this initiative offers an inspiring example of what can be achieved when young voices are valued and included,” she said.He advised the group that as they dialogue with and advise the EU delegation, they must do it with integrity and the heart of the young people of this country.“We expect you to propose critical areas and to advocate for projects and programs that are responsive to the needs and the rights of our young people,” Mateke said.She urged them to arm themselves with current knowledge, especially in the theme areas they have selected, claiming that this is the only way they can tell "our partners how best the young people can change their lives".Prompt action on issuesHoward Mwesigwa, the chairperson of the YSB in Uganda, said this was another chance for the young people to ensure prompt action on issues, such as human rights, gender equality, and the digital agenda.In reference to the European Union's Multi-Annual Indicative Programme (2021–2027), Mwesigwa said the board would like to reiterate its commitment to working in tandem with the EU to ensure the adoption of a youth-centric approach in the EU's targeted cooperation agenda as articulated in the three broad areas of green and climate transition, sustainable growth and jobs, democratic governance, and social inclusion.Phiona Nyamutoro, a youth representative in Parliament, lauded the formulation of the board, saying they have been pushing for the inclusion of young people in meaningful engagement in all aspects of decision-making.She urged the board members to contribute to society.Belyndah Amanya, the vice president of the Gulu University Guild and a board member, expressed her gratitude for being a part of the fantastic team that will work to elevate the interests of the youth.“Committed to collaboration, innovation and positive change, we embark on this journey together, determined to make a difference,” she added.
