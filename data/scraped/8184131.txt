 We picked OnDeck for its variety of business lending products and same-day funding. OnDeck offers a term loan from $5,000 to $250,000 with repayments terms of up to 24 months. You can also access a credit limit of $6,000 to $100,000 through its line of credit with a 12-month repayment term that resets after each withdrawal. Eligibility Turnaround time  You can apply and receive a decision from OnDeck on the same day. Expert’s Take OnDeck has carved a niche in the realm of alternative lending, offering expedited access to capital for businesses that may not qualify for traditional bank loans. Its big advantage is the availability of funds on the same day or next while not being affected by a hard credit pull. However, this aggressive lending practice also comes at a steep price. — Abid Salahi, co-founder and CTO, FinlyWealth

 Bluevine is a financial technology company that provides financing solutions to small businesses nationwide. It specializes in business lines of credit and checking accounts. As of December 2021, Bluevine no longer offers invoice factoring as one of its financing methods. Small business owners looking to access a line of credit on an as-needed basis can receive funds from $5,000 to $250,000. Bluevine offers two payment structures: Flex 6 or Flex 12. Customers who choose Flex 6 make weekly payments over 26 weeks while Flex 12 customers make monthly payments over 12 months. What’s more, after 45 days of payment on Flex 6, or 90 days of payment on Flex 12, you may be eligible for a credit line increase. Bluevine also charges weekly or monthly fees for its line of credit. Standard pricing is 1.7% per week or 7% per month for line of credit draws. Note: Bluevine’s line of credit is available in most U.S. states except Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. Eligibility Eligibility varies on the specific program a business owner chooses. Weekly plan Monthly plan Turnaround time After you submit your application, you can receive a decision in as quickly as five minutes and instant funding with a Bluevine business checking account. Borrowers who don’t have a Bluevine business checking account can receive funds within 24 hours. Expert’s Take Bluevine appeared in a search we did for clients during the mini-banking crisis of 2023. Bluevine offers a bank sweep program that will provide FDIC insurance to their clients for up to $3 Million. FDIC insurance usually doesn’t matter, but when banks start failing, it really matters. — Herman Thompson, Jr., advisory board member

 National Funding offers working capital small business loans from $5,000 to $500,000 with terms of four months to two years, paid daily or weekly. Borrowers can use their funds for all working capital needs, including inventory, payroll, marketing, taxes and more. National Funding also offers equipment financing up to $150,000 but applicants must have a minimum personal credit score of 575 to qualify for that financing method. Unlike most business lenders, National Funding offers early payoff discounts. Small business loan customers who repay their total remaining balance in full within the first 100 days of the contract will automatically receive a 7% discount off the total remaining balance. Equipment financing customers who repay the total remaining balance early, at any point during the term, will automatically receive a 6% discount off the total remaining balance. Eligibility Turnaround time Most loans are funded within 24 hours of approval, subject to receipt of required documentation, underwriting guidelines and processing time by your bank. Expert’s Take National Funding offers loans from $5,000 to $500,000, but two years is the maximum length for a large loan. I had a client that got excited by what he thought would be a lending source that could do $500k for five years, but the five-year loan was only offered at $100,000. A local banker made a collateralized loan for the large equipment purchase, and the client took a small short-term loan from National Funding to help with cash flow during a tough spot. — Herman Thompson, Jr., advisory board member

 Varies by loan term see below for details American Express Business Blueprint™ is best for its American Express® Business Line of Credit (formerly Kabbage from American Express and Kabbage Funding™), which gives business owners the chance to secure funding between $2,000 to $250,000. Repayment terms include six, 12, 18 and 24 months with monthly fees of 3% to 9% for six-month loans, 6% to 18% for 12-month loans, 9% to 27% for 18-month loans and 12% to 18% for 24-month loans. Line of credit customers incur a loan fee for each month they have an outstanding balance. Total monthly fees incurred over the loan term range from 3% to 9% for six-month loans, 6% to 18% for 12-month loans, 9% to 27% for 18-month loans and 12% to 18% for 24-month loans. In addition to its line of credit, American Express Business Blueprint provides other tools beneficial to small business owners, including its own mobile app that provides comprehensive cash flow insights. All businesses are unique and are subject to approval and review. Eligibility All businesses are unique and are subject to approval and review. The required FICO score may be higher based on your relationship with American Express, credit history and other factors. Turnaround time Once application is approved, funds can take up to three business days to appear in your account, depending on your bank. Expert’s Take The American Express® Business Line of Credit allows you to qualify at a credit score of 660 FICO at the time of application*, so it’s not a great option for any business with a bad credit rating. Rather than a typical revolving line of credit, you must choose [from available terms] with varying fees. Every time you withdraw from your business line of credit, it’s treated as a separate installment loan rather than being added to existing loans. One downside to the American Express® Business Line of Credit is the time it takes to receive your cash. You’ll need to wait for your funds to be deposited within three business days, while other lenders offer same-day options. If you need your cash fast, that delay becomes a problem. — Jonathan Feniak, general counsel and head of finance, LLC Attorney

 Fundbox is an AI-powered business lending platform that speeds up the application, decision-making and funding process. It offers decisions within three minutes and funds as soon as the next business day. Prospective borrowers have two business financing options through Fundbox. Business owners can apply for revolving business lines of credit up to $150,000 with repayment terms of 12 or 24 weeks. Your available credit goes back up as you repay your line of credit. Eligibility Turnaround time With a business line of credit from Fundbox, you can receive your funds as soon as the next business day. Expert’s Take The approval process is quick and Fundbox is available for the credit-challenged business. Credit approvals are usually small, so this [typically] isn’t an option for larger purchases. I had a small business client that had Fundbox integrated with her Stripe dashboard, which made it convenient. — Herman Thompson, Jr., advisory board member

 Business owners can apply for traditional term loans and lines of credit, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans and even other products like credit cards and checking accounts through TD Bank. TD Bank offers business loans from $10,000 to $1 million  with terms ranging from one to five years. If you’d rather have access to a line of credit, it offers credit lines between $25,000 and $500,000. What’s more, TD Bank is an SBA-approved lender, meaning you can apply for an SBA through the bank. SBA loans typically have loan amounts of up to $5 million and terms up to 25 years. The company also stands out for healthcare professionals and offers unique financing options for dentists, veterinarians, physicians and eye care professionals. For instance, it offers lending solutions up to $12 million with 100% practice financing plus working capital, in addition to partnership buy-ins and buy-outs, equipment purchase, and practice mergers and acquisitions. Note: While online applications are available for loans up to $100,000, you must apply in person for loans over $100,000. TD Bank has branches in Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia and Washington D.C. Eligibility Turnaround time Although TD Bank offers same-day approval for its business loans and lines of credit, it may take up to two business days to receive your funds. SBA loans, on the other hand, may take several weeks to fund.

 Funding Circle has been a direct lender specializing in small business loans since 2010. It has helped 135,000 businesses in 700 industries and lent $20.2 billion globally. We chose Funding Circle because it provides fast, affordable loans with a simple application process and funding in as little as 48 hours. Prospective borrowers have three options: business term loan, line of credit or SBA loan. Funding Circle term loans range from $25,000 to $500,000   with repayment terms from six months to five years. If you choose to apply for a business line of credit, you can access credit lines between $6,000 and $100,000. However, Funding Circle doesn’t specify its line of credit repayment terms. You can also apply for Funding Circle SBA loans, which range from $25,000 to $500,000 with terms up to 10 years. There is one main drawback of Funding Circle: There’s a one-time origination fee on each loan ranging from 3.49% to 6.99% of the approved loan amount. Eligibility Turnaround time Depending on the loan type, you can receive your funds within two days. However, SBA loan funding may take up to two weeks. Expert’s Take Funding Circle provides long-term loans that are essential for businesses planning significant investments in growth or infrastructure. The clear terms and lower interest rates compared to short-term loans make this an excellent choice for businesses with a stable financial outlook and a strategic long-term development plan. — Cache Merrill, founder and CTO, Zibtek

 650* *See website for details Biz2Credit is a digital funding platform that provides three funding options—term, revenue-based financing and commercial real estate (CRE) loans—ranging from up to $1 million. It only takes a few minutes to apply. Biz2Credit can connect business owners with revenue-based financing Up to $2M+ and term loans up to $1 million. Revenue-based financing payments are flexible based on business performance, with a right to reconcile against actual business receipts while term loans are repaid through weekly, bimonthly or monthly payments over the course of 12 to 36 months. Biz2Credit also offers interest-only CRE loans from Up to $2M+ with terms between 12 and 36 months; payments are due monthly. In the event that Biz2Credit cannot provide a financial product, it may present third-party options to qualified prospective borrowers. However, Biz2Credit confirms that “in the vast majority of cases, [it] will make a financing decision without referral to any external party.” Eligibility Eligibility varies based on the financing option you choose. Term loan Revenue-based financing Turnaround time Biz2Credit does not disclose the turnaround time for its financing options. Expert’s Take Similar to Funding Circle, Biz2Credit emerges as a more balanced alternative and functions as a platform to offer a wide range of loans. Due to the more thorough underwriting process, the qualification requirements are more restrictive than other business lenders and funding may not be as quick. — Abid Salahi, co-founder and CTO, FinlyWealth 
 We reviewed 21 popular lenders based on 16 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category: Within each major category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms and applicable fees. We also looked at minimum credit score and time in business requirements and the geographic availability of the lender. Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online applications, prequalification options and mobile apps. Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion. To learn more about how Forbes Advisor rates lenders, and our editorial process, check out our Loans Rating & Review Methodology. The best small business loans depend on a prospective borrower’s unique needs. For example, some lenders impose time in business and annual revenue requirements that may be difficult for newer LLCs to meet. Other lenders may specialize in a type of financing that’s not relevant to all LLCs. Here’s what to consider when comparing loans for an LLC: An LLC loan is a business loan that helps LLCs finance everything from startup costs to the purchase of equipment and other expenditures necessary for operation and growth. LLC loans are no different from small business loans in general, though some types of funding may be better suited to one business than another. An LLC loan is a commercial loan provided to an LLC for expenses such as working capital, asset acquisition or business expansion. This type of loan is typically secured under the name of the LLC, not the individual members, which means the liability is limited to the company itself.  To obtain an LLC loan, the company must provide the necessary documentation, including financial statements, business plans and credit reports during the application process. Lenders use this information to assess the financial health of the company and its ability to repay the loan.  The conditions of these loans, including interest rates, repayment plans and terms, often vary depending on the lender and the financial strength of the LLC. Approval for the loan also depends on the LLC’s creditworthiness and, sometimes, the personal credit history of the members—especially for newly established LLCs. Once approved, the LLC can use the funds based on the agreed-upon terms of the loan contract. The borrowing needs of an LLC can depend on a number of factors, and some types of business loans meet these varied needs better than others. These are the most common types of LLC loans: The requirements for an LLC loan are used to determine the financial health, reliability and potential profitability of an LLC. Common LLC loan requirements include: The process of getting a business loan varies by lender and depends on the type of financing. However, most lenders require borrowers to follow a similar application process. Follow these steps to get an LLC loan: 1. Review your credit. Before applying for an LLC loan, check your personal credit score. Lenders typically require a minimum FICO score of 680 to qualify for SBA loans or traditional bank loans, but this varies. 2. Identify your borrowing needs. Evaluate why your LLC needs to borrow money and calculate how much it needs to borrow. This can help you determine what kind of financing your business actually needs. For example, if you anticipate needing cash to cover ongoing operating costs, a business line of credit may make more sense than a term loan. Likewise, if your business needs to purchase a large piece of equipment, a secured loan may offer the most competitive interest rates. 3. Compare lenders. Identify lenders that offer the types of financing and qualification requirements consistent with your LLC’s borrowing needs. This should involve determining whether you are likely to qualify and whether each lender offers competitive loan amounts, repayment terms and interest rates. Also take time to read customer reviews and keep an eye out for red flags that may signal poor customer service or even predatory lending practices. 4. Organize financial documents. Lenders typically ask prospective borrowers to provide extensive financial documents during the application process, but requirements vary. In general, expect to provide at least 12 months of personal and business bank statements, two years of tax returns and details about other outstanding debts. It may also be necessary to provide copies of your business plan, business licenses and applicable legal documents. 5. Submit a formal application. Finally, submit an application online or by visiting a lender branch in person. Most lenders contact applicants via phone or email to collect any outstanding documentation or to gather additional information. Lenders may fund business loans as soon as the day of loan approval. However, it generally takes a few days for borrowers to receive funds—and much longer for SBA loans. The time it takes to receive funds also varies based on the borrower’s bank.
 LLC loans can provide the financial infrastructure necessary to expand and boost the operations of an LLC, but other funding options are available. Other options may be better suited to your specific needs, financial health and long-term goals of the LLC and can include: 
 To qualify for a loan, an LLC should meet the lender’s minimum time in business requirements—often between six months and two years. Similarly, the applicant must usually demonstrate that the business satisfies the lender’s quarterly or annual revenue requirements. The exact amount varies from lender to lender but must be sufficient to cover the borrower’s existing debt service as well as payments on the new loan. Finally, LLC loan applicants must meet credit score requirements set forth by the lender. Depending on the age of the business, an LLC may qualify for a loan based on its business credit score or the applicant’s personal credit score. An applicant should have a personal score of at least 680 to qualify with most lenders, but this varies by bank, type of financing and other factors. You can use an LLC loan for a variety of business-related expenses. They can finance operational costs, equipment purchases, payroll and expansion efforts. These loans can also fund marketing strategies, manage cash flow during slow seasons, buy business real estate or cover unexpected expenses. You can get a business loan with an LLC, but the LLC must be created prior to submitting an application for financing. The process of applying for a loan as an LLC is the same as for other types of businesses. Instead of applying as an individual, provide the legal name of the LLC and the business banking information tied to that entity. Generally, the LLC is responsible for repaying the loan—not the individual business owners. However, if the lender requires the business owner to sign a personal guarantee, they can be held personally liable for loan repayment if the LLC defaults. Business owners may be able to use personal loans to access funds for an LLC, depending on the lender. This type of loan can help cover LLC filing fees, startup costs and other realities of starting a business from the ground up. Personal loans may also be easier to qualify for than business loans—especially for LLCs without any demonstrable revenue. That said, taking out a personal loan to finance LLC expenses means the business owner is personally liable for repaying the loan. If the borrower misses payments or defaults, it will impact their personal credit score—not that of the LLC. What’s more, personal loan interest rates may be higher than for business loans, and personal loan interest isn’t tax-deductible like business loan interest. An LLC can get an SBA loan as long as it meets all of the SBA’s eligibility requirements and complies with the lender’s qualification and application requirements. As with private loans, SBA-backed lenders impose credit score requirements and other qualification standards when evaluating applicants. SBA eligibility requirements vary by the loan program, but applicant LLCs must operate for profit, and be engaged in—or have proposed to do business in—the U.S. or its territories. The applicant also must demonstrate that the LLC has reasonable owner equity to invest in the business and that the LLC has used other sources of funds—like personal assets—prior to applying for financial assistance from the SBA.
