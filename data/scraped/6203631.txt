Save up to $15/month: As of October 19, all Grammarly Premium Plans are on a 50% off sale. You can choose to be billed annually, quarterly, or monthly (for $6, $10, and $15 per month, respectively). Generative AI writing helpers are everywhere right now, making it all the more important to distinguish between legit and less-than-legit options. Grammarly is one of the OG writing aids — it started all the way back in 2009 with the simple mission of helping people be more effective communicators. Whether you're writing a tricky email to a new boss or a 3,000-word capstone essay for college, Grammarly is there to help maximize your writing power.  As of October 19, all Grammarly Premium Plans are on a 50% off sale. This means that the Annual Plan now costs $6/month, the Quarterly Plan $10/month, and the Monthly Plan $15/month. To be sure, Grammarly is still available for free, but its Premium offerings are much more robust. Now might be a good time to test them out for yourself! The Grammarly Premium Plan is jam-packed with perks like 1,000 Generative AI assistant prompts per month, real-time writing suggestions that focus on aspects of the craft like clarity, spelling consistency, tone delivery, and even something called "inclusive language," as well as citation tools and a plagiarism detector. Even if you consider yourself a modern-day Ernest Hemingway, it never hurts to double (and triple!) check your work for accuracy. A paid Grammarly plan (now made all the more affordable!) allows you to do just that — no real-life writing coach needed.
