Whilst Goiás have lost their last three league games, Atlético Mineiro are without a win in their last six matches in all competitions. Neither side have set the world alight defensively though, which could mean that we still see goals in this encounter. Each of Goiás’ last three have seen both teams score, which was the same case in five of those six most recent Atlético Mineiro fixtures. Regardless of who comes out on top here, back both teams to score.
