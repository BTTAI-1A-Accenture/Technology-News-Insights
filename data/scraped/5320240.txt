The company surpassed Wall Street's top and bottom-line estimates. CSCO's revenue of $13.60 billion increased 6% year-over-year and was ahead of Wall Street's estimate of $13.30 billion. Also, its non-GAAP EPS was $0.86, up 5% year-over-year, beating the consensus estimate of $0.84.

These results demonstrate the relevance of our strategy, our differentiated innovation, and our unique position to help our customers become more resilient," said Chuck Robbins, CSCO's chair and CEO.

Its remaining performance obligations (RPO) rose 3% from the year-ago value to $30.90 billion, with product RPO growing 5%.
