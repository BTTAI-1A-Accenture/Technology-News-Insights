The agreement is expected to help Avenira and Arruwurra’s members build their relationship, as well create pathways to sustainable commercial outcomes and social benefits. Avenira is a current proponent of the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct (MASDP). Its Wonarah project is located in the Barkly region of the Northern Territory, and is one of the largest phosphate deposits in Australia. In April, the Northern Territory Government granted Avenira two mineral leases, which allowed Avenira to extract a bulk sample for testing and if successful, a direct shipping ore program (DSO) could commence. The Wonarah project is expected to initially export phosphate rock and will eventually supply to Avenira’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) project at MASDP. The WWP is expected to initially create 25 jobs in the Barkly region, which will then increase to 50 jobs during the DSO – on top of the 100 jobs estimated in the first stage of the LFP facility. The project is set to generate more than $US4 billion (approximately $AU6 billion) in revenue annually once scaled to full production. Chief Minister of the Northern Territory Natasha Fyles said the project will benefit the Northern Territory. “With the potential to create over 1000 jobs, this project will benefit Territorians from the Top End to the Barkly with the manufacturing plant to be built in Darwin, which will exclusively source phosphate from the WPP in the Barkly,” Fyles said. Minister for Mining and Industry Nicole Manison said the Northern Territory has what it takes to be a thriving economy with world class mineral deposits. “Increasing demand and the transition to renewable energy, battery storage and use of high technology products has resulted in global organisations looking to establish diversified, reliable and stable supply chains,” Manison said. “Creating jobs up and down the track, this project is the way future and what the Territory needs.”
