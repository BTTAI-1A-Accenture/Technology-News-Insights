    Infarm has successfully produced wheat in an indoor farm. First trials allowed a projection of 11.7 kg indoor-grown wheat per m2 yield per year. Further projected at scale, this is the equivalent of 117 tonnes indoor-grown wheat per hectare per year – 26 times that of open-field farming yields, Infarm claims. The company says it produced wheat in an indoor farm, using no soil, no chemical pesticides and much less water compared to open field farming.
