Without any additional commit messages except the repository description, Nvidia posted the source code for its Developer Kit tool on Github under the NVIDIA Corporation organization umbrella. We do currently have the DXVK-NVAPI, which is an alternative NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK, so there's a potential it could help projects like this. There is a considerable difference between reading some API documentation stating how a resource should be used and investigate some undocumented behaviour versus having the code available to also read its implementation. Some of the files pushed to that repository like the nvapi_lite_salstart.h date back from 2012 as per file headers. While there is some code available in that repository, libraries are still being provided as binaries like the amd64/nvapi64.lib and x86/nvapi64.lib files. The dxvk-nvapi creator also opened on Issue request to include the nvapi-open-source-sdk as well on a Github repository for better tracking of future releases. Is this an indication that NVIDIA is on it's way to better collaboration and that it also sees potential in projects like the NVK opensource driver? Only time will tell...
