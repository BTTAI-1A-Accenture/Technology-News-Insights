 The city is reviewing a permit application for the Target retail chain store at 10490 San Jose Blvd. in Mandarin to add an Ulta Beauty products department. The scope of the “shop within a store” work includes the interior remodeling of 4,131 square feet of space of the sales floor to include Ulta finishes and lighting updates at an estimated cost of $80,000. Groom Construction Co. of Salem, Massachusetts, is listed as the contractor. Ulta.com shows that it has departments in two area Target stores in St. Johns Town Center and St. Augustine. In February 2022, Minneapolis-based Target Corp. said that when it launched the Ulta Beauty presence in more than 100 stores in August 2021, “we knew the dynamic partnership was something special.” It said it planned to add more than 250 Ulta Beauty at Target locations in 2022, building toward 800 total.    “Since Target and Ulta Beauty partnered, our shop-in-shops have delivered more prestige beauty brands and industry-leading expertise to more guests,” said Christina Hennington, Target executive vice president and chief growth officer. The release said the Ulta Beauty locations sell more than 50 skin, makeup and hair care brands. Target and Ulta announced the partnership in November 2020. Target said in a release Nov. 10, 2020, that the Ulta Beauty at Target in-store destinations will be near its beauty section and “designed to showcase a wide range of prestige products and brands not available at Target today.”   Your free article limit has been reached this month.Subscribe now for unlimited digital access to our award-winning business news.
