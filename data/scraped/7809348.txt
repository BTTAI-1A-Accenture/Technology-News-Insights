While Mario may be the undisputed King of jumping, platform games have always been a common part of the gaming industry, challenging players to complete puzzling levels using the in-game jump mechanics, perfect sense of timing and the quick reflexes needed to avoid any dangers such as traps or enemies.
     Here are the greatest platform games of all time according to review aggregator Metacritic.                     These games tend to be tough, especially in the latter levels, as they are designed to challenge players. With few other obvious parts they could use to challenge gamers such as boss fights, the game levels have to be tough enough to stop players from breezing through the levels. Even with that being said, there are definitely some platforming games that stand out from the others as being punishingly difficult.
                         When a movie gains as much notoriety as Toy Story 2, there is no doubt that it will get an eventual game based on it, which was exactly the reason for the PS1 platformer Toy Story 2: Buzzlight Year to the Rescue. Based on the popular Pixar movie of the same name, players will control space toy Buzz Lightyear as he traverses platforms familiar to fans of the movie to rescue Woody, just like the in the movie.
                         One might expect a game based on a children's movie to be relatively easy, but that's where players might be wrong. Though most of the game won't present too much of a challenge, there are random difficulty spikes throughout some of the levels that would see many players tumbling to their deaths and forced to restart. The lack of checkpoints will also see a lot of players hard work undone from just a simple slip of a button.
                         When asking if people played the classic platformer Skullmonkeys on PS1, most would likely give that person a blank stare coupled with the obvious question as to what they are talking about. Skullmonkeys is an old and forgotten title from the PS1 era, in which players control Klaymen and fight through hordes of the titular creatures Skullmonkeys who are working under command of the evil Klogg.
     Some of the best RPGs are all but forgotten on the classic gaming system, the PS1.                     This platform jumping game is noted for not being the easiest, however, with many people not even managing to play the game through to completion. The boss fights and platforming gameplay just proved too much of a challenge for gamers of the day. Though compared to modern-day games and challenges available to them, Skullmonkeys just might not measure up.
      Rayman is a classic title that has endured many years to bring new and exciting games to players of all ages, dating back to its debut in 1995, establishing itself immediately as a platforming giant. The title is the name shared with the main character, a being who is renowned for his courage and determination. Like most game protagonists, he finds himself saddled time and time again with the fate of the world, such as Mr Dark in the original Rayman game.
                         Once players are thrust into the platforming gameplay of Rayman, they will quickly learn his courage and determination aren't enough, and the player must also have these qualities in spades. Razor-sharp precision is a must for successfully navigating through the platforming worlds, and even then players can still fail due to the slippery environments and the unpredictable ways enemies spawn into the environment. Players will most likely find themselves attempting every level repeatedly to make it through to the end.
                         Combining third-person shooting elements with platforming gameplay is the ambitious formula that went into the creation of the PS1 sci-fi classic Blasto. In this futuristic game, the evil alien tyrant Bosc is making moves to rule over the entire solar system using the might of his alien army and capturing the Space Babes. Being the only hero capable of stopping him, Blasto arms himself and sets off to put a stop to Bosc's machinations and save the Space Babes along the way.
                         What makes Blasto such a challenging game is the game controls and camera actively work against the player, making even the simplist parts of the game an unnecessary challenge. Combines with the lack of any barriers around the environment, one simple misstep can spend players plummeting to their demise.
      Earthworm Jim 2 proved to be just as difficult as its notorious predecessor. This game does bear some striking resemblance to is predecessor, such as questing through the world and across various platform levels in order to save the Princess from the evil Psy-Crow. But there are some innovations in the second game, such as a larger variety of things Jim can do, and more guns at his disposal that open the door to new gaming mechanics.
                         One thing that remains the same however, is how difficult the game is. Enemies can be punishingly strong and tear through Jim's health like he is made of wet tissue paper, which not even the plethora of health restoration items could prevent. Playing through Earthworm Jim 2 to completion is a major test of endurance that any player should be lauded for.
                         An oldie but a goodie, Abe's Odysee is an adventurous platform game set on the fictional world of Oddworld, inhabited by a species known as Mudokons. Though known to have amazingly rich culture, they end up enslaved to Glukkons, a race that obsess over power and money, and would do anything to achieve their greedy goals. Abe's Odysee centers around a character with the same name: Abe, one of the enslaved Mudokons. After overhearing Glukkons speak of making meat from the Mudokons, Abe resolves to escape his enslavement.
     The Oddworld franchise is both timeless and treasured. Today we'll take on the task of ranking every game in the series from worst to best.                     As one might expect of an escaped slave and now fugitive, Abe faces a plethora of challenges across Oddworld as he makes his escape. Daringly high and long jumps, hazardous obstacles in the environment as well as enemies intent of hunting down Abe. It is undoubtedly one of the most unforgiving and challenging platformers with the amount of dangers against Abe that could cut him down as the player is trying to trial and error their way through puzzles. Players will struggle to keep their cool and their blood pressure down.
      Crash Bandicoot is one of the most famous game series of all time, and were what Naughty Dog was known for before the times of Uncharted and The Last of Us. In this classic platformer, players control a mutated bandicoot called Crash, which is exactly what the player will be doing a lot of in this game's levels. Crash must race through the levels as he chases down the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who has kidnapped his girlfriend Tawna, and plans world domination.
                         But, players will have anything but an easy time doing so. The punishingly difficult platforming levels will require precision levels of timing and rhythm that are hard to get right, and no amount of memory reflex will save them. Anything less than perfect plays will have them having to restart the level, and resist the urge to chuck their controller at the screen.
