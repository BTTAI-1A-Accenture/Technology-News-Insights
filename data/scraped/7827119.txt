The company also showcased its four electric motorcycles which will be launched towards the end of 2024. The new S1X electric scooter comes in three variants, S1X (with a 2KWh battery), S1X with a 3KWh battery and S1X+ also with 3KWh battery but with more connected features, company founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said at a customer event held at Ola Future Factory in Krishnagiri (Tamil Nadu). The S1X with a 2KWh battery variant has been launched at an introductory price of Rs. 79,999 for the first week and will be priced at Rs 89,999 afterwards, he said. Bookings will start immediately and deliveries will begin by December, Aggarwal said, adding the entry-level electric scooter is aimed for daily commutes of around 10-20 km. The S1X variant with a 3KWh battery has been launched at an introductory price of Rs. 89,999 for the first week and afterwards, it will be tagged at Rs. 99,999. The variant can be booked immediately and deliveries will begin in December, he said. The S1X+ has also been launched at an introductory price of Rs. 99,999 for the first week and afterwards, it will be priced at Rs. 1,09,999. He said customers can book the model immediately and deliveries will be by the end of September. Aggarwal said the S1X and the S1X+ are differentiated in software and connectivity features. The S1X has a range of 151 kilometres on a single charge and can reach the top speed of 90 km/hour. "These scooters together represent the end of ICE age scooters," he claimed, highlighting the cost advantages of owning an electric scooter over an ICE counterpart.
