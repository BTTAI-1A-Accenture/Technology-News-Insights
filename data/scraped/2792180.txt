AUCKLAND, New Zealand – The Philippines remains in high morale as it started its build-up for their next outing in the 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup following a respectable showing in their first match against Switzerland. The Filipinas trained on Sunday at the Olympic Park, a day before they leave for Wellington for matchday two against host team New Zealand, with a positive attitude following a 2-0 loss to Switzerland.  Filipinas coach Alen Stajcic said the team proved that they belonged in the big stage during the match against Switzerland. “Really good actually,” said Stajcic after the official training on Sunday morning, when asked about the morale of the Filipinas. “Everyone is in good spirits. Lot of belief in the team despite the result. There is a lot of belief because we all knew that was an amazing performance for a debut in a World Cup.

But I think we showed that we belong at this level and for a first top effort in the World Cup, I really thought it was an amazing effort from the players and everyone back home in the Philippines, all the football fans should be really proud of how they represented the country,” said Stajcic. Stajcic lauded the composure of the players, showing no signs of pressure and keeping themselves in the match despite conceding two goals in the match against Switzerland. “I actually think that I can’t believe how well they control their nerves in the game. In the first 15 to 20 minutes, I thought we were exceptional and probably the best moment of the game for us was the beginning of the game. Just shows how well they’ve prepared, shows how well we prepared as a team.

 The Filipinas go into high gear in their preparations against New Zealand, which picked up a landmark win when the Football Ferns defeated Norway, 1-0, last Thursday. “The fact that a debut team can go into the first game was such a big occasion in front of a big crowd and almost a home crowd of the Filipino fans and feel comfortable to be on that field. From that perspective, I think our preparation (before the World Cup) was spot on,” said Stajcic.
