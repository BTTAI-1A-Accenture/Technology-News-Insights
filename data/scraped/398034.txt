Bionomics Limited BNOX announced topline results from its Phase 2b ATTUNE trial of BNC210 for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The trial met its primary endpoint of change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total symptom severity score from baseline to Week 12 (p=0.048).  A statistically significant change in CAPS-5 score was also observed at Week 4 (p=0.015) and at Week 8 (p=0.014). Treatment with BNC210 also showed statistically significant improvement in clinician-administered and patient self-reporting in two of the trial's secondary endpoints.  Specifically, BNC210 led to significant improvements at Week 12 in depressive symptoms (p=0.040) and sleep (p=0.041) as measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively.  BNC210 also showed signals and trends across visits in the other secondary endpoints, including the clinician and patient global impression-symptom severity (CGI-S, PGI-S) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). Treatment with 900 mg twice daily BNC210 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Additionally, the Company recently held a Phase 3-enabling End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to advance BNC210 for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder into registrational studies and is awaiting receipt of the formal meeting minutes.
