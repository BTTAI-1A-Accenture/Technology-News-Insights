A one-stop shop like Best Buy is the place to grab the latest tech, whether online or in-store. As with our guide to the best gifts for her from Best Buy, we’ve compiled the best gift ideas for him from the tech giant, from budget-friendly products to those a little more extravagant if you’re looking to splurge. His skin will stay soft and squeaky clean no matter where life takes him. A Reviewed-approved brand, we included the Black Wolf skincare set on our list of the best gifts for men. This bad boy is yet another necessary addition to his skin-and-self-care arsenal. The Sonic Scrubber features a detachable telescopic handle and high-speed oscillating brush head, a hygienic, high-tech alternative to his grubby old loofah. It’s cordless and rechargeable, too, making it super travel-friendly and convenient. Upgrade his headset to one of our favorite models. Many hardcore gamers prefer the reliability of wired accouterment. Headsets like the Razer Kraken provide fantastic sound quality and reduce the risk of interference and latency. I recommend this personally as one of the more affordable, highly-rated models. We’re fans of Razer Kraken headsets here at Reviewed. Why not consider grabbing two so you can game with him? If he’s a frequenter of the gym, grab him these nifty earbuds. I won’t use the term “gym bro,” but if he’s athletic, these ergonomically designed earbuds stay put during physical activity. They’re also waterproof, making them ideal for sweaty, high-impact workouts. With a long battery life and a quick charge feature, the JBL Endurance Race earbuds provide hours of high-quality sound paired with noise-cancellation features, which strike a balance between immersive listening and assuring awareness of his surroundings. This budget-friendly drone can capture incredible footage. Unless we’re talking toy versions, drones tend to be pricey. But the Snaptain S5C won’t cost you or him an arm and a leg. Thanks to user-friendly controls and features like voice control and gesture recognition, it’s a great choice for an entry-level hobbyist, whether his interests lie in aerial photography and videography, or indulging childhood fantasies of piloting an X-wing starfighter. His whiskey on the rocks just got a little better. How best to ensure that every drink he cracks open is, well and truly, “a cold one?” Why not get him the Insignia Portable Ice Maker? This compact, efficient machine produces up to 26 lbs of ice daily and stores up to 1.5 lbs at a time, making it perfect for small gatherings or personal use. Don’t worry about drainage, either: it has a water recycling system with a 2.1-quart reservoir, reducing the number of times he’ll have to refill. Best enjoyed with friends. Everyone loves enjoying a fire pit with friends. The Mesa XL’s design produces smokeless, efficient burning, so no stinging, watering eyes to worry about while he socializes and luxuriates in the ambiance. It’s also lightweight and portable, perfect for backyard gatherings, camping trips, and twilit picnics at the park.  Even his dentist will be impressed. Electric toothbrushes live up to the hype—I can’t live without mine. The same goes for my Waterpik flosser, which we ranked as the best water flosser on the market. So, why let him continue to struggle with the manual dexterity flossing requires—and live with the inferior clean it gives him—when you could up his oral hygiene game with a shiny new toothbrush and a super easy flossing bonus? Razer is one of our favorite brands for gaming gear. I know what I said about wired gaming accoutrements, but this Reviewed favorite is no joke. It was a solid performer when we tested the best gaming mice. Advanced features like customizable buttons, an adjustable scroll wheel, and hyper-responsive switches will help your gamer guy fine-tune gameplay for maximum performance. Also, it just looks sick. Cut his gas bill in half with a Google Nest. A smart thermostat can give the financially minded man some piece of mind in this economy. The Google Nest Thermostat, which ranked highly on our list of the best smart thermostats, can help him save money on energy bills by automatically adjusting temperatures according to his schedule. It can also help him track his energy usage and provide personalized, energy-saving tips and tricks to help him reduce his carbon footprint.  This cordless drill a must-have in his tool kit. Is your favorite handyman jonesing for a new toy? Unlike traditional brushed drills, brushless models work more efficiently and generate less heat, so they’ll last longer and require less maintenance. This Greenworks model also packs more power and torque; without the friction of brushes to slow things down, it can reach higher speeds, making it the ideal tool for easily tackling tough jobs and projects. Kick move night up a notch thanks to Govee. We can attest that Govee’s TV backlights are an excellent way to spruce up an entertainment center. He’ll love customizing effects that correspond with what’s playing on the screen, be it movies, shows, or video games. The Govee app and compatibility with Alexa and Google Assistant make it easy to operate and super user-friendly. Help him catch up on his TBR list.] Included in our guide of the best gifts for boyfriends, the Kindle Paperwhite is perfect for bookworms who aren’t fundamentally opposed to digital editions. A high-resolution display and adjustable built-in light make this e-reader’s glare-free screen super easy on the eyes. And, with access to millions of books, magazines, and newspapers, he’ll never run out of reading material. Sound quality doesn’t get much better than with Bose. Bose audio systems are famous for their exceptional sound quality, and the Companion 2 Series III system is no exception. Maybe his desktop setup could use a makeover. Perhaps it’s in dire need of some clear, balanced audio. This sleek, stylish set would be the perfect addition, wouldn't it? Solve his manscaping woes with a Philips shaver. A razor for a gift? It's a little cliche, but sometimes you can’t beat the classics—especially when they’re this deluxe. Reviewed tested and approved, the Norelco 9500 provides a smooth, irritation-free shave. With three speed settings and a Smartclick precision trimmer, he’ll have total, customizable control over his shaving experience. It’ll look great on the bathroom counter, too. Keep his brews chilled with this insulated cooler. Camping, hiking, and fishing trips require more than just a cooler. This one is sturdy enough to withstand rugged environments and is equipped with cup holders, tie-down loops, and a fish-measuring ruler. Make sure he takes one along on his next outdoor adventure. He’ll finally understand all the VR hype. We’re big fans of the Meta Quest 2. He will be, too, even if he does not prioritize immersive gaming and entertainment. High-resolution display and powerful processing capabilities offer a stunningly realistic virtual reality experience. The wireless, lightweight headset is comfortable for extended periods, and hand controllers provide intuitive, precise movement. What’s not to drool over? Ease his mind with this car security system. Show your favorite gearhead some love in the form of vehicle security. The Viper DS4VB has advanced features like remote start, keyless entry, and security alerts to prevent theft and break-ins. It’s easy to install and compatible with most vehicles; all the better if he’s got a collection. This Ninja oven will be the star of his outdoor space. This is the outdoor cooking equivalent to those 25-in-1 body washes. You know, the kind of stuff he loves because of convenience and practicality. Here at Reviewed, we love this trusty outdoor oven. He’ll be able to roast, broil, bake, smoke, dehydrate, and even make pizza.  His post-workout soreness is no match for the Theragun. How’s his recovery game? Probably not as excellent as if he had a Theragun Elite, which we included in our list of the best massage guns. Lightweight and easy to use, its various attachments target specific muscle groups. Soreness, stiffness, and pain will melt away under the magic of advanced percussive therapy technology. Up his at-home workout game. Last but not least, yet another Reviewed favorite. These dumbbells took the top spot on our list of the best adjustable dumbbells. Durably constructed, easy to use, and with an extensive range of weight options, these top-rated dumbbells will make him never want to buy another set.
