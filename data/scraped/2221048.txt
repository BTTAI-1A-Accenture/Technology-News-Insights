DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The "Viral Clearance and Viral Testing Services Market - Distribution by Scale of Operation, Method of Viral Clearance and Testing, End-User and Key Geographical Regions: Industry Trends and Global Forecasts, 2023-2035" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
 
Viral clearance and viral testing refers to the detection and elimination of viral contaminants, using a wide array of methods, to ensure the product's safety for human use. Over the past few years, viral clearance and viral testing has emerged as one of the key pre-requisites for biopharmaceutical regulatory approvals. It is worth mentioning that, till date, over 630 biologics have already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while more than 8,000 biopharmaceuticals are in the clinical evaluation process. This increased number of approvals and ongoing clinical trials in the biopharmaceutical industry has resulted in a rise in the demand for such studies.
 
Benefits and Growing Demand for Viral Clearance and Viral Testing Services
 
Viral clearance and testing studies have emerged as a mandatory step for regulatory submissions of biologics for commercial applications. These studies result in streamlined manufacturing of contamination free / safe products and on-time delivery of biologics. Owing to this, the demand for these services has increased significantly. It is worth highlighting that, with the continuous revision of the regulatory guidelines, viral clearance and testing studies are already amongst the most essential steps in the manufacturing of biologics, including antibodies, blood products, cell and gene therapies, hormones, recombinant proteins, therapeutic proteins and vaccines.
 
Need for Outsourcing Viral Clearance and Viral Testing Studies
 
The rise of biologics has resulted in an increasing demand for viral clearance and testing studies. However, these studies are quite cost intensive, time-consuming and follow stringent regulatory guidelines. In addition, they require specialized technical skills and good scientific expertise. This has prompted the biopharmaceutical developers to outsource these studies to the service providers, which have aseptic laboratories, GMP-certified facilities and specialized equipment in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.
