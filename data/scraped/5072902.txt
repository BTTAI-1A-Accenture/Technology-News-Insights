Module code: BIOL40683 Disease, Health and Environment are fully intertwined so that our health, and the health of life on the planet, depends upon the environment and its critical role in ecological balance, ecosystem services and healthy living. Our impact on the global environment is unprecedented and together with natural changes and their consequent often unknown effects, we need to understand these complex relationships to minimise our impact, restore habitats and improve our environment for health and wellbeing Module code: BIOL40680 Genetics, evolution and diversity lay the foundations of life science education and enable advanced study of the life sciences in the 21st century. Understanding the concepts, the evolutionary drivers of life on the planet, will ultimately enable us to apply this knowledge to life saving and game changing bioscience technologies that have the power to enhance, remediate, manipulate, control and create life. Module code: BIOL40681 This module builds on, and develops, the themes and learning previously gained in your first year.  As awareness and understanding of global issues in the biological sciences grow, you will be encouraged and supported in taking an active role in disseminating appropriate and accurate scientific material.  Recognition of professional and personal development and identity as a biologist will remain a core theme and will, at this level, have a strong employability focus.  This module is designed to help you acquire the skills and qualities that will enhance your prospects, horizons and personal success and continue to prepare you for the expectations of the world of work.You will attend the cross-level global issues lecture series, and will use the cross-level workshop sessions to help support and develop your ideas for disseminating accurate information to various audiences.You will be expected to maintain a professional development portfolio and further specific opportunities for professional development will be provided.  This may include opportunities to make connections with numerous individuals and groups, both from within our own department, from other schools and departments, as well as with external collaborators.  These connections will help to inspire and guide your professional and personal development.  You will also be supported in finding a suitable work placement provider in order to complete the required hours of work placement. Module code: BIOL50721 This module builds upon the fundamental laboratory skills you developed in your first year. Blocks of advanced hands-on skills development techniques will be delivered that support the major areas of the biological sciences. Areas will include advanced microbial techniques, field sampling and identification, biochemical testing, physiological measurements and the techniques of molecular biology.All blocks will incorporate appropriate experimental design protocols and the use of inferential statistics applicable to the data being collected. Module code: BIOL50719 This module will help you consider the prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that are impacting upon human health and disease.  You will explore molecular interventions, bioinformatics and data science that are informing the decisions made in a healthcare setting.  Areas such as transfusion and transplantation, therapeutic drug monitoring, immunotherapy and vaccinations, pharmacogenetics, anti-microbial and anti-viral therapies (including drug resistance and infection control), and reproductive interventions will be considered.  Aspects of regenerative medicine and ageing will also be covered.  Consideration of these interventions will be taken at the level of public, or population, health and as well as an individualised, precision medicine approach. Module code: BIOL50728 You will investigate the processes that contribute to our overall health and wellbeing before considering how changes to, or dysfunction of, these processes can contribute to disease.  Consideration will be given to the collection of diagnostic samples as well as the types of samples collected.  This will include investigation of neoplastic disease (cellular pathology), pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms (medical microbiology), haematological function and dysfunction (haematology), haemostasis in health and disease (coagulation), reproductive function and dysfunction (clinical embryology), immunological function and dysfunction (clinical immunology), biochemical and metabolic dysfunction (clinical biochemistry) as well as infectious disease and substance abuse.  Consideration of the application of clinical genetics will be given across all fields and this will include aspects of medical ethics.   You will consider the application of current techniques within each area, as well as technological advances that allow disease to be diagnosed, or predicted, in both times of apparent good health and disease.  This will include consideration of cellular, biochemical, and molecular investigations. Module code: BIOL50727 As environmental management has moved into the 21st century the traditional idea that managing the natural world is about returning damaged ecological systems to their prior state has become more controversial.This module will build upon this changing emphasis and will consider more flexible adaptive approaches to managing ecosystems. These will be built upon the firm underpinning that humans and their activity are also part of the natural world. Some material with focus upon preventing further damage but the emphasis will be a sustainable incorporation of society and ecosystem.The key thread will be the incorporation of conservation based ideas into sustainable and equitable frameworks. Not only in the proximate urban setting but at the planetary level. Well planned and integrated ¿greenspace¿ have the potential for providing areas of high biodiversity they may also deliver highly useful environmental goods and services, including coping with a diverse range of problems ranging from drainage and pollution, coping with food and water security, all the way to improvements in both physical and mental health.The module aims to provide you with an insight into the variety of ways the landscape may be managed and utilised when trying to provide a more collective stewardship of our environment. As such it will cover a wide range of traditionally disparate disciplines ranging from the biological and biophysical components through to the human factors, both positive and negative, that contribute to this area of study.Integral collaborative work alongside professionals will strengthen your knowledge and employability of real world 21st century conservation projects. Whilst working on these projects you will develop a deep understanding and you will be asked to share your knowledge through the delivery of a short session as the expert on your project to provide a case study for other members of the group.Overall the module will explore the idea that protection of the environment and the economy are not mutually exclusive and give you some of the knowledge and approaches that the environmental professional is increasingly confronted by, competing or even conflicting environmental objectives, further complicated by the multifunctional character of the ultimate goal, planetary sustainability. Module code: BIOL60672 There are four key themes encompassed within this module:1. The protection of the brain microenvironment by the Blood Brain Barrier understood in terms of selective transporters and the tight junctions. 2. Non-neuronal glial cells, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and epidermal cells. 3. Sensing and moving, considering electrical transmission to and from the brain via nerve tracts.4. Who am I. Here memory, in terms of long-term potentiation, is considered. Learning considering synaptic plasticity is explored and an examination of decision making. Module code: BIOL60676 Conservation biology has been described as a crisis discipline and as one of the most value-laden areas of biology. During this module we will examine both descriptors, and the implications for how we go about conserving biodiversity. We will look at the various meanings of terms such as biodiversity, conservation and rarity. We will critically examine the role of zoos, biotechnology and species reintroductions as conservation strategies, as well as the role of ecological theories and concepts (e.g. Island Biogeography Theory, metapopulation theory, landscape ecology, population viability analysis). This will include a more general look at the role of theories and models in science. The single-species (e.g. flagship and umbrella species) and habitat-based (e.g. biodiversity hotspots) approaches will be examined. Having covered the topics outlined above you will be in a better position to evaluate the ethical and pragmatic arguments for nature conservation, including policy decisions and strategic agendas such as Biodiversity Net Gain, to reach informed opinions. Module code: BIOL60665 The aim of this module is to develop knowledge of the targets for pharmacological intervention in disease with an emphasis on neuropharmacological agents. You will be asked to explore the key concepts of molecular pharmacology: Molecular Signalling and Mechanisms of Drug ActionChemical Biology and Drug DiscoveryDrug-Receptor Complex effectsHuman Body Systems Analysis of Drug ActionDrug Transport and Metabolism Module code: BIOL60675 Microbiology has been revolutionised by the ease of whole genome sequencing, enabling us to better appreciate the diversity of life on earth and the interactions of microorganisms and the environment. This module will explore the methods used to analyse microbial genomes and the genes they encode. You will be introduced to state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools and their applications: you will gain hands on experience of applying these tools to analyse sequence data to understand the biology of the microorganisms. The pathogenesis of a range of bacteria, viruses and parasites will be investigated in the context of their genome and the virulence genes they encode. The importance of genome rearrangements, resulting in antigen variation, and differential gene expression in pathogenesis will be discussed. We shall study the application of whole genome typing to understand the epidemiology of pathogens, such as during infectious disease outbreaks, including the real-time sharing of whole genome sequence data for surveillance. We will critically evaluate the use of whole genome sequencing to inform antimicrobial chemotherapy, including the challenge posed by data analysis for routine application. You will learn about the application of SSU rRNA screening and metagenomics in microbiome research, biotechnology and drug discovery. Module code: BIOL60674 In this module, you will explore the multidisciplinary use of biomedical investigations in the diagnosis and evaluation of pathological processes. The module will develop your underpinning knowledge of blood, cellular, infection and genetic sciences and you will integrate these across a range of case studies to evaluate the role of biomedical investigations in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease.Within the module you will follow a series of clinical case studies across a range of pathological conditions, including malignancy, chronic multifactorial diseases, acute and emergency presentations, and the effects of aging. Alongside these case studies, you will attend lectures and undertake online learning to develop your knowledge of biomedical investigations across all disciplines. You will then apply your knowledge and evaluation through group workshops where each case will be discussed in a Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) format, integrating clinical data with the results of biomedical investigations, and evidence-based practice.Discipline-specific content will include the role of routine and specialist haematology in the diagnosis and classification of anaemias, malignancies and monitoring of coagulation pathways; the role of transfusion science in the preparation and supply of therapeutic blood products; the role of clinical biochemistry in the monitoring of organ and system function and dysfunction, and the assessment of nutritional status; the role of cellular and molecular pathology in the diagnosis and stratification of malignancies; and the role of clinical microbiology in the diagnosis and treatment of infections. Throughout the module, you will be encouraged to develop a critically evaluative approach, with emphasis given to the appropriate requesting and interpreting of clinical tests, sensitivity, specificity and predictive value, and the uncertainty of measurement in a clinical context. Module code: BIOL60667 Tumour biology will be studied under four broad headings, each one considering tumours on a larger scale. 1. Molecular and Cellular Tumour Biology: Here we will study genetic changes associated with carcinogenesis including the effects of chemical and physical carcinogens, oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes and their relationship to DNA repair mechanisms and cell cycle progression. Changes in cellular morphology and behaviour associated with carcinogenesis will also be studied.2. Tumour Growth and Treatment. Within this section we will study the changes in tissue architecture associated with the progression from normality to malignancy and metastasis. We will also consider, in the context of tumour development, the effectiveness and mechanisms of currently used approaches of tumour therapy including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy. 3.Whole Body Effects of Tumours: This section will include study of the effects that tumours may have on parts of the body distant from their site of growth due to either their physical growth e.g. through blockage of the alimentary tract, or their metabolic effects e.g. through the secretion of ectopic hormones. This section will also include screening and diagnostic tests for cancer. 4.Tumour Epidemiology: Here we will consider the findings of large scale studies of the incidence tumours in populations. The balance between genetic, epigenetic and environmental influences will be evaluated together with an evaluation of the possible effectiveness of intervention strategies to reduce tumour incidence by changing behaviour and lifestyle. The second part of the module considers the discipline of regenerative medicine and stem cell biology. You will study stem cell biology in depth and their application to regenerative medicine. You will study the molecular and genetic control of cell fate specification and differentiation., including stem cell niches, adult, embryonic and cancer stem cells. Induced pluripotency and the use of stem cells in therapy. Consideration will be given to existing and potential clinical use of stem cells and their derivatives, and of the ethical issues that this raises. As this is a rapidly developing field, strong emphasis will be placed on understanding the current research in this area. Module code: BIOL60664 In this module you will study how the immune response develops and resolves, focussing on the activation and functional diversity of T and B cell responses  including T helper cell differentiation and regulatory T cell function.  The cellular requirements, molecules and associated signalling pathways, required for each of these processes will be covered.  Following on from this we will discuss how these processes can be modulated to aid in the control of disease.You will go on to understand the role of clinical immunology departments in the diagnosis and management of conditions affecting the immune system.  The importance of basic and translational research, and how these fit into the remit of HCS, will be examined.The history, development and current diversity of immunotherapy treatments will be discussed.  Their impact on patient outcomes, both actual and potential, will be considered.  Biologics such as monoclonal antibody therapies, antibody-drug conjugates, CAR T cell therapy, vaccines, and cytokine therapy are examples of the immunotherapies that could be covered.  Elements of design and development, clinical trials, funding and the relationship to personalised medicine will be covered.  The influence of genomics on the development and impact of cancer immunotherapies will be considered.A patient first approach will be taken throughout the module considering the importance of being able to convey complex mechanisms, processes and therapies to a lay audience. Module code: BIOL60673 The module studies the interrelationships that are involved in the development of multifactorial human diseases and of their relationships with each other. Many of the major chronic multifactorial disorders that affect the Worlds population in the 21st Century are a result of genetic, environmental or even it could be argued behavioural factors. This module explores the impact of these factors on disease development and thus reviews the current understanding of their aetiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. Examples of diseases are cardiovascular disease (such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure), diabetes mellitus, obesity and amyloidosis. Module code: BIOL60669 Applied parasitology will investigate the interactions between parasites and their hosts. The focus will primarily be placed on human health effects but will include important veterinary examples. Parasitic groups will include, for example, protozoa, helminths, ectoparasites and vector borne infections. Many of the vector borne infections are carried by insects and mites that are within the scope of medical entomology, although there are notable exceptions.Medical entomology relies on a thorough understanding of vector insect biology, ecology and the behaviour. Haematophagy is studied very much from the anthropological perspective, with a focus on the effects of insects of medical importanceCo-ordinated global activities of surveillance and control are examined and we will look at current concerns and threats both nationally and internationally. Management strategies are explored through example and the lessons learnt from history. Parasitological and medical entomological research forms a theme throughout the module where research informed sessions focus on authentic challenges to human health. Module code: BIOL60663 This module is designed to provide you with a thorough grounding in the essential principles of modern toxicology. These principles will be extended and explored through a series of specific studies designed to appeal to a varied range of scientists. It is envisaged these will include areas such as behaviour altering drugs, agrochemicals, food additives, various air pollutants, organ specific toxins, endocrine disrupting substances, weaponised toxins, poisons/poisoning and post-mortem toxicology.Techniques for assessing toxicity within the laboratory and field will be critically evaluated including some of the standard analytical approaches.

As a mature student I had to get back in to the mindset of studying whilst also being able to juggle my family responsibilities, this can be quite daunting. With the help and dedication of university staff this transition was smooth.   The Biomedical Science degree prepared me for my career by giving me many opportunities, including a three week placement where I was able to start my professional networking. From this I was successful in getting a job at University Hospital North Midlands prior to my graduation. One year on and I am now working as a band 5 and about to register as a Biomedical Scientist, where I use the skills and knowledge gained at Staffordshire University to help in the diagnosis and monitoring of sick patients Vicky Dugmore  BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science The Academics had so much knowledge and are passionate about their subject areas. I didn't think I’d say this - I actually looked forward to going to lessons, learning was fun. I would recommend this course 1000 %. The main reason I would recommend this course is because the staff care. They are all willing to go the extra mile to help you succeed. They have high expectations of everyone and they believe in you. Going to Staffordshire University is a great, life changing, experience. I am very grateful and proud to have gone to Staffordshire University. Tom Watson  BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science I extremely like the University’s buildings which are well-equipped with technological material accessible to everybody ranging from using the latest laptops in laboratories to borrowing laptops and cameras. Moreover, I enjoyed the facilities that I can benefit from. For example, the library has got a study skills area where there are specialised tutors in every subject, which guide me with my difficulties and needs. Another facility is the career studio situated in the Science building. In fact, I have been helped to build up my CV, to improve my LinkedIn profile and to simulate mock interviews.   Kavindi Warnakulasooriya  BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science I gained a lot of confidence when completing my project in third year, despite being pretty terrified the entire time as it was the first time completing independent lab work. I guess it was my favourite part of the course as it was the most challenging: when you're uncomfortable, you grow. Every module was fab and taught us something new, challenging us with interesting content and encouraging further reading past the module. The support from uni has been lovely. All the biology lecturers, lab technicians, and campus staff are really easy to talk to about any concerns about uni work or life in general. Angela Samonte  BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science  I had a great three years studying Biomedical Science, completing my IBMS Registration Portfolio and being awarded the IBMS President Prize, which opened the doors to my current position. I am now employed at the Royal Stoke Hospital as a Haematology and Transfusion Biomedical Scientist where my roles range from providing blood products in emergency situations and escalating abnormal findings such as new leukaemias to the clinical team.  George Machin   BSc (Hons) Applied Biomedical Science Completing this degree has made me think about how knowledgeable I actually am and to believe in myself, I can doing anything if I put my mind to it. One of my favourite parts of the course was getting to know the biological and biomedical team and learning about their career journeys. They were inspirational. The support has always been there when I’ve needed it and I thank all of the team for developing me into a biologist. Thank you so much! Chelsey Jones  BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science  With Staffs you get more time in the lab than anywhere else. I got so much lab time that it’s unbelievable! The experience and the knowledge that I've learnt throughout the four years has prepared me for any career that I go into.  Adam Olivier  BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science  I have gained so many new friends, I feel part of the community.
