High street shopper numbers surged 19.7% and shopping centres increased by 13.4% while retail parks slipped 1.6%.

High street footfall dropped 9.3% on three years ago, 4.3 percentage points better than November, and an improvement to the three-month average decline of 11%. Retail parks footfall dropped 5.2% on pre-pandemic levels and was 1 percentage point worse than November and worse than the three-month average decline of 4.5%. Footfall in shopping centres plummeted 19.9% year on three years ago but was 3.3 percentage points better than last month’s rate and an improvement on the three-month average decline of 20.9%. However, Dickinson warned that 2023 will be another difficult year for retailers as footfall remains down over 10% of pre-pandemic levels. “Nonetheless, this was still a significant improvement on the previous two years when the pandemic kept many people at home,” she said. “Although retailers’ input costs show little sign of easing in 2023, they continue to do all they can to keep prices affordable and tempt customers in.” Click here to sign up to Retail Gazette‘s free daily email newsletter ﻿ Ted Baker's administrators have announced that 15 stores will close as part of efforts to  Editorial: 020 8222 0500
