Q4 Business Segment Performance Small Business and Self-Employed Group The QuickBooks Online accounting division witnessed a remarkable 22 percent revenue growth for the quarter, contributing to an annual growth rate of 26 percent. This surge was primarily attributed to an expansion in the customer base, increased effective prices, and shifts in product mix. Online services revenue exhibited a noteworthy growth of 20 percent for the quarter and an impressive 34 percent for the entire year. This surge was propelled by the ascending demand for payroll services, Mailchimp integration, and an upsurge in payments. International online revenue showcased a growth rate of 12 percent for the quarter and an impressive 31 percent for the entire year, indicating Intuit’s global reach and appeal. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue experienced a commendable increase of 21 percent, totaling $2.1 billion. Furthermore, Online Ecosystem revenue also surged by 21 percent. Credit Karma Segment In contrast, Credit Karma revenue experienced an 11 percent decline, settling at $424 million. The drop in revenue was primarily attributed to macroeconomic challenges impacting segments like personal loans, auto insurance, home loans, and auto loans. This decline was partially offset by a surge in credit card usage and the adoption of Credit Karma Money. Consumer and ProTax Groups TurboTax Online units experienced a 5 percent decline, aligned with the trend of taxpayers who had filed in previous years to avail pandemic-related stimulus and tax credits but abstained from filing during this period. Notably, TurboTax Live revenue witnessed a commendable 17 percent growth, accompanied by a 12 percent increase in TurboTax Live customers.
