ABOUT THESE IMAGES    Click for high-resolution image. —Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center Antarctic daily images  Click for high-resolution image. —Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center Arctic sea ice continued the fast retreat that was observed in July through August 10, followed by a brief slowdown, only to pick up pace again. During the first half of August, the ice primarily retreated in the northern Beaufort Sea and in the East Siberian Sea. The ice also mostly cleared out of the Northwest Passage, whereas ice remained in the Chukchi Sea, along the Northern Sea Route. In the Southern Ocean, sea ice began to expand rapidly after a slow growth from May through July, but remains at the second lowest daily extent as of this post. Figure 1a.

Sea Ice Index data.Credit: National Snow and Ice Data CenterHigh-resolution image Arctic sea ice extent as of August 18 was 5.20 million square kilometers (2.01 million square miles) (Figure 1a). The first week of August continued to have the rapid pace of ice loss observed in July (Figure 1b). However, afterwards the pace slowed for several days but picked up again. Extent approaches 2007 levels, while tracking above the record 2012 minimum. Sea ice extent is currently fourth lowest, behind 2012, 2019, and 2020. Ice loss has primarily occurred in the northern part of the Beaufort Sea and to a lesser extent in the East Siberian Sea as well as in the Canadian Archipelago, where the Northwest Passage is nearly ice free. Elsewhere, there has been little northward retreat of the sea ice edge. The high-concentration area of ice south and east of Wrangel Island has remained, though some openings started to emerge off the coast of Siberia as southerly winds drove this packed ice northwards. Most of the remaining ice is of low ice concentration. As of August 18, the sea ice extent was 1.98 million square kilometers (764,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average and 540,000 square kilometers (208,000 square miles) above 2012, the record low for this time of year.

Air temperatures in the Barents Sea near Franz Joseph Land were as much as 8 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) above average where a strong anticyclone (high sea level pressure) was located (Figure 2b). Low sea level pressure dominated the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas. Coupled with the high pressure over eastern North America, warm winds from the south moved into the Beaufort Sea while cold air from the Arctic Ocean moved into the Chukchi Sea. Figure 3a.

Boisvert, NASA GoddardHigh-resolution image When snow starts to melt on sea ice, it can be easily detected using the same passive microwave sensors used to measure ice concentration. This is because liquid water in the snowpack results in a strong increase in the passive microwave emission compared to a cold, dry snowpack. This year the melt began particularly early in southeastern Hudson Bay, beginning in April (Figure 3a), more than a month ahead of the 1981 to 2010 average (Figure 3b). This contrasted sharply with later melt onset in the northwestern part of Hudson Bay, where some ice still remains today. Elsewhere, melt onset was 10 to 30 days earlier in the eastern Arctic Ocean, whereas melt was mostly 10 to 30 days later than average in the western Arctic Ocean. Melt was also 15 days later than average in northern Baffin Bay and around 5 days later in the East Siberian Sea. The coastal region of the Kara Sea was also slow to melt this spring, starting around the end of June. As a result, the sea ice remained in the coastal areas of the Kara Sea well into July.

Credit: Cook et al., 2024High-resolution image The Northwest Passage (NWP) is a sea route that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean through the channels of the Canadian Archipelago. It has been long imagined as a potential future economic backbone for global trade. There are several routes through these channels. In 2007, the northern deepwater route of the NWP, entered from the west through M’Clure Strait, was ice free for the first time during the satellite data record and has been open several years since. As of August 15, the sea ice area in the northern route is currently tracking just above the 2011 record low (Figure 4a). The southern route, known as Amundsen’s Route, is tracking below the 1991 to 2020 average, but above the record low with ice still present in Victoria Strait (Figure 4b). Although ice conditions have been very light in recent years, challenges to navigation still exist. For instance, the processes of Arctic Ocean sea ice export and seasonal first-year ice aging create choke points in the NWP. Historically, the presence of multiyear sea ice has stymied visions of the NWP becoming a trade route, but recent reductions in sea ice caused by climate change are reinvigorating these visions. A recent study by Alison Cook and colleagues reviewed four possible routes through the NWP and considered ships with different levels of ice strengthening over the past 15 years (Figure 4c). The study found that sea ice frequently obstructed some areas of the NWP leading to consistently shortened shipping seasons over the past 15 years. Despite the shipping season length becoming longer in several other sections of the NWP, the viability of full passage is actually lessening as a consequence of climate change. This finding is linked to sea ice melting in the Arctic Ocean between northern Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago, often referred to as the Last Ice Area, which is breaking up and migrating south, clogging narrow channels in the NWP and hampering route reliability for ships operating in the region. These results support those from an earlier study this year by Stephen Howell and colleagues. Figure 5. Click to animate. This NASA Worldview image shows how smoke from Canadian wildfires moved through the Arctic from August 6 to 18, 2024. Credit: NASA WorldviewHigh-resolution image The impacts of wildfires are increasing as climate changes and human development encroaches farther into forested areas. Wildfires even occur in the far north during the summer period. Recently, there was an outbreak of new fires in northern Canada near Great Bear Lake. The smoke from these fires has drifted east and north over the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and as far as northwest Greenland (Figure 5). Smoke from the fires reduce the incoming solar energy, slowing ice melt, but when the smoke particles fall onto the ice, they lower the albedo, which increases the amount of energy absorbed at the surface and increases ice melt. However, at this time of the year, the sun is already low on the horizon, so smoke most likely won’t have much affect on ice melt. Figure 6.

Sea Ice Index data.Credit: Walt Meier, National Snow and Ice Data CenterHigh-resolution image As noted above, currently, the sea ice extent stands at fourth lowest for this time of year. We can estimate the extent through the end of the summer using the daily ice loss rates from previous years to project the September minimum extent. This method, which has been regularly contributed to the Sea Ice Outlook, provides a reasonable range of the minimum extent. This year, using the average daily loss rates from 2007 to 2023, the projection starting from August 18 results in a projected minimum of 4.14 million square kilometers (1.60 million square miles), with a range of 3.93 to 4.35 million square kilometers (1.52  to 1.68 million square miles) (Figure 6). This suggests that this year’s minimum will potentially be the third lowest in the satellite record and likely to fall somewhere between the second and eighth lowest. It indicates that a new record low surpassing 2012 is very unlikely. Figure 7.

The growth has primarily occurred in the Weddell Sea and to a lesser extent in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (Figure 7). Ice growth for the first two weeks of August was 1.5 million square kilometers (580,000 square miles) per day, among the fastest ice growth rates seen in the 46-year record for this time of year. Nevertheless, the total extent remained the second lowest in the satellite data record. As of August 18, the extent was 1.27 million square kilometers (490,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average, and 1.07 million square kilometers (413,000 square miles) above 2023. Cook, A.
