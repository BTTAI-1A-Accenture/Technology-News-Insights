 Using artificial intelligence to make railways safer. From WJXT News4JAX article and the video: Duos Technologies is working to enhance railroad safety with its railcar inspection portal.  The system uses cameras, sensors, computers, and artificial intelligence (AI) to scan rail cars and tankers for potential problems as they pass through a designated area. If an issue is detected, the rail companies are promptly notified. The technology is currently being used by some railroad companies in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The Railcar Inspection Portal technology could potentially have a wider implementation if the Department of Transportation and Congress deems it necessary. Read More. Watch the Video Here.
