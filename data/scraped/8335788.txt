Home > Gaming News PUBG MOBILE is set to launch its latest Version 2.6 Update, featuring an array of new content and improvements. Most notably, the update introduces Dinoground, a prehistoric event occurring from May 16th to June 18th, where players can explore Dino Settlements on the maps of Erangel and Livik, filled with supplies and populated by dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex. In an exciting twist, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the monarch of prehistoric creatures, will randomly emerge in the settlement’s Fossil Keep during a match. This occurrence will prompt players to demolish the keep’s gate and liberate the dinosaur, which they can then ride. The Dinoground event also brings Primal Zone areas into the game, randomly scattered across Erangel, teeming with aggressive Pterosaurs and Velociraptors. These prehistoric creatures can also serve as mounts once tamed by players. Each dinosaur offers unique advantages, with Velociraptors providing adaptability across various terrains and a potent jump, while Pterosaurs offer the ability to fly, capturing teammates or enemies from above. These Primal Zones also feature mini-games, providing opportunities for players to earn in-game rewards. The Pterosaur Hoops Challenge is one such mini-game, where players must navigate their Pterosaur through a series of hoops suspended from hot air balloons within a given time limit. Successful completion of this aerial challenge will reward players with Dino Treasure supplies upon landing. Players can also discover Dino Treasures on elevated platforms, accessible through the strong jump of a tamed Velociraptor. The Version 2.6 Update doesn’t stop at Dinoground; it extends to PUBG MOBILE’s creative mode, World of Wonder. This update will enable more players to participate and construct their own experiences with an array of improvements and upgrades. It will also introduce a new multiplayer platformer racing template, allowing players to place hidden traps to challenge others’ skills. Moreover, the Version 2.6 Update brings along a myriad of updates for Cycle 4 Season 12, offering new content, rewards, and cosmetics for players to unlock. The newly renamed Royale Pass Ace 1 aligns with the launch of Dinoground, featuring new core rewards, Season Missions, and an engaging backstory. PUBG MOBILE will also be revealing a collaboration with a motorcycle brand later in the update. Shaun Savage is the founder and editor-in-chief of Try Hard Guides.
