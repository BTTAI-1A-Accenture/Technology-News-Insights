             Ok.  Maybe I am a little bit ready to talk about this.  I put my husband in the ground Wednesday morning.  It was one of the hardest things I've ever done.  He fought a long time with cancer and finally wore out.  I really thought we would have more time.  Everyone does.  I am overwhelmed by the support I have gotten from friends and family, including former coworkers from the job I lost in December.  I didn't see that coming and they are a good batch of people - Thank you to my crew at Rheonix Inc. I am truly touched and I miss you guys.  

Obviously I will need a short while to process this heartbreak as I am truly devastated.  To recruiters and potential employers, please give me a few to heal, but please do not overlook me for opportunities to be part of your team.  I know I need to move forward and start over and I will be an outstanding addition if given the chance.  Thank you. Financial Consultant at NBT Investment Services I am sorry for the loss of your husband.  Grieving and healing is different for everyone.  May God comfort and strengthen you at this time.

             This.  This is why it is a no-go for uprooting all I know for any job.  If you want to relocate because you like an area, or want to be nearer to family/friends- ok.  Good reason.  Not for a soulless corporation that you are disposable to.  Otherwise, grow where you are planted.  Put down deep roots into your community and have broad leaves (network) to find the nutrients you need to thrive.
