Another iconic Louisville ice cream shop is getting ready to open its doors for the 2023 season, and it's bringing back a staple feature. Dairy Del, located just on edge of the Merriwether neighborhood and near Schnitzelburg, is opening back up early next month. Watch footage of Dairy Del above. And when the shop opens up, the walk-up window will be open as well. This was a feature that went away during the COVID-19 pandemic. The longtime staple in Louisville is known for its milkshakes, derbies, classic cones, chili dogs and a host of other food and ice cream options. Located at 1516 South Shelby St., Dairy Del will open March 5 and be open seven days a week from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Follow along on their Facebook page for an exact opening date. Another classic Louisville ice cream shop, Dairy Kastle, which is about a mile away, also just recently announced its opening date.  The 47-year-old shop will reopen on March 7.
