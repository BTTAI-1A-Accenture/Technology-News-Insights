 (Yicai Global) Dec. 6 -- Chery Automobile dismissed media reports that Luxshare Limited has become the Chinese carmaker’s biggest shareholder, adding that the company’s business information is being updated on corporate data platforms. Chery Auto’s major shareholders and their stakes are unchanged, the Wuhu-based firm said, adding that its four biggest investors are its parent company Chery Holding Group, Anhui Credit Financing Guaranty Group, Wuhu Construction Investment, and Luxshare. Information on corporate data platform Qichacha showed that more than 10 shareholders of Chery Auto, including Chery Holding and Anhui Credit Financing, had withdrawn, with Luxshare owning a 77 percent stake in the carmaker, followed by Wuhu Construction with 6.9 percent. Qichacha is a corporate credit reporting agency registered with the People's Bank of China, and its data usually comes from business registration information. The information on Chery Auto had yet to be corrected as of late yesterday. Luxshare kept its original 7.9 percent stake in Chery Auto, and Wuhu Construction remains Chery Holding’s largest shareholder, the carmaker said. In February, Luxshare bought 19.9 percent of Chery Holding, 7.9 percent of Chery Auto, and 6.2 percent of Chery New Energy Automotive from Wudaokou New Energy Automobile Industry Fund Enterprise. Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry, Luxshars’s subsidiary, and Chery Holding also joined hands to set up a new energy vehicle joint venture to design, develop, produce, and export core auto parts and components for Luxshare, helping the company to become a leading tier-one car parts supplier.
