Sana Biotechnology SANA shares are trading higher after the company announced the publication of a paper in Nature Communications on hypoimmune-modified allogeneic CD19-directed CAR T cells. The paper reports the efficacy of HIP CAR T cells in killing tumors in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient models of humanized mice. The study found that HIP CAR T cells were equally effective in clearing tumors in both models and were not prone to exhaustion. Additionally, HIP modifications did not impair CAR T function. The study also suggests that targeting CD47 can rapidly clear HIP CAR T cells. “SC291, our hypoimmune CD19-targeted allogeneic CAR T therapy, has transformative potential for patients with B-cell malignancies if these results translate to our clinical studies, and we look forward to presenting initial clinical data later this year," said Steve Harr, Sana's President and CEO. Sana Biotechnology is a company focused on changing the possible for patients through engineered cells. SANA Price Action: Sana Biotechnology has a 52-week high of 9.59 and a 52-week low of $2.99. Sana Biotechnology shares are up 26.4% at $4.74 at the time of writing, according to Benzinga Pro.
