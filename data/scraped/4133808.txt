 A portion of Aviation Parkway was closed much of the day Monday because of the crash. He was not hurt and climbed out of his vehicle on his own. The crash is under investigation. Sky 5 flew over the scene at 11 a.m., when the SUV was visible. The vehicle was not submerged, but its back wheels were in the water. A firetruck and several police cars were on site, with officers directing traffic. At least one lane of Aviation Parkway was closed and there were delays in the area.
