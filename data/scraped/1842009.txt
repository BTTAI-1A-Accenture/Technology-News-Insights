Fans of Marvel have been looking forward to the upcoming Disney Plus series Loki. However, Disney is now facing backlash for a newly-shared poster from the series, which appears to use AI. The debates revolving around AI have become quite important lately. It’s one of the reasons that both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike. As such, it seemed like we’d be seeing less of it in the entertainment industry. But this new poster suggests otherwise, at least where The Walt Disney Company is concerned. Of course, it has yet to be confirmed that the Loki poster was created with the assistance of AI. But many social media users seem to believe so. As you can see below, many users on X, formerly known as Twitter, are discussing the poster and how the clock in the background appears to have been made with AI. If you look closely, you can see what appear to be glitches around the roman numerals on the clock. Furthermore, some users believe that Tom Hiddleston’s likeness, along with the other actors featured, are the result of digital 3D scans rather than actual photographed poses. One user shared the poster, and after claiming that “assets in this poster are A.I. generated,” added an additional comment that asked “Is it that hard to download stock images of a clock?” Is it that hard to download stock images of a clock? — Millie Fangs (Read Pinned!)

(@MillieFangs) October 3, 2023  I don’t see the problem he- oh… pic.twitter.com/Kcjrlg8DkZ — MoonHunt (@MoonHunt128) October 3, 2023  IIII was actually a thing tbh, the AI indicator are the weird glitches yoy can find on the clock and symbols above the roman numbers — lucas (@luferreiroroche) October 3, 2023  Because god forbid actual experienced 3D artists get the opportunity to work for or at the very least get commissioned by Disney for promotional art 🤦🏾 — Diva Princess (@diva_princess98) October 3, 2023  Disney can waste millions on characters/alien/monsters designs just to be used for 2 seconds worth of screen time? Yet they can’t hire someone to draw a clock spiral around Tom’s head? — TheSpookMann🎃 (@VMahughMann) October 3, 2023  With this, the prices raising and no more password sharing in November; it’s never been easier to unsubscribe. Just hope people have the spines to actually unsubscribe like they say they will — ɯɹouosʇoN (@Notsonorm) October 3, 2023  Hopefully we’ll have more clarity on the issue soon. If not, eagle-eyed fans will have to pay attention to see what could actually be created with the use of AI or not. The first season of Loki is currently available to watch on the Disney Plus streaming service. MCU fans will be able to stream Loki Season 2 on October 6, 2023. Stay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates as we may have them. Whether or not this poster actually used AI, it’s clear that artificial intelligence will still remain a topic for quite some time. While it might not go away completely – we can only hope that proper rules and regulations are kept in place for those that use it.
