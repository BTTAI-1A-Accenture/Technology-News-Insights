The Vivo sub-brand iQoo made waves here when it finally debuted on our shores with the iQoo 11 late last year by being the first smartphone in Malaysia to pack the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 system-on-chip. If you’re thinking of picking up the iQoo 11 for yourself, you’ll want to stay awake later as the smartphone will be on sale on its official Shopee store on 25 March. During iQoo’s Ramadan sale on its Shopee store, the iQoo 11 will be going for just RM3,399 together with free shipping, RM100 less than its retail price of RM3,499. iQoo is also throwing in some purchase-with-purchase deals when you snag an iQoo 11, with the iQoo cooler down to RM99 from RM219, the iQoo Wireless Active earbuds down to RM79 from RM159 and for the hardcore gamers out there, the iQoo finger sleeves will be on sale for just RM9.90, down from RM29. As a refresher, the iQoo 11 launched back in December last year packing a 6.78-inch, 1400 x 3200p AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate. The screen comes with HDR10+ certification, with iQoo also adding in a Vivo V2 image signalling processor that boosts frame rates in games up to 120fps. On the back meanwhile is a BMW M Motorsport racing stripe, across a back panel that’s built out of fibreglass and vegan leather. Under the hood is of course the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor mated to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage. You’ll even be able to add 8GB more virtual RAM if needed. To keep it cool, the iQoo 11 has a liquid cooling system using a 4,013mm² stamped stainless steel vapour chamber. Being a gaming phone, photography isn’t its strong point but the iQoo 11 still has a triple rear camera setup with a main 50MP camera flanked by a 13MP 3x telephoto shooter and an 8MP ultrawide camera, while up front there’s a 16MP selfie camera too. Elsewhere, the iQoo 11 comes with a 5,000mAh battery with 120W FlashCharge fast charging, with iQoo claiming that it’ll be able to charge the smartphone from zero to hundred in just 25 minutes. You’ll also find stereo speakers, an in-display fingerprint sensor as well as support for WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC and 5G.
