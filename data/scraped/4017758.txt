 All the latest key personnel moves across the insurance market. Paul Moors has joined Go Shorty as chairman, adding significant experience to the existing executive team. Moors led Bollington Insurance Brokers from 1998 to 2017 when he completed the buyout and simultaneous merger of Bollington Insurance Brokers and F Wilsons Insurance Brokers to Create Bollington Wilson Group alongside Inflexion Private Equity Partners LLP. In 2021, he completed the sale of Bollington Wilson Group to one of the UK’s leading independent brokers Arthur J. Gallagher. Andy Moody, Go Shorty’s founder and managing director, commented: “Having recently grown our senior management team, the arrival of Paul as our chairman brings significant additional strength to our executive board. Paul is already a well-respected chairman, and his depth of experience across the insurance industry will be instrumental to our growth over the coming years.” Gallagher has promoted James Kent to CEO of global insurance strategic relationships, with Tom Wakefield succeeding him as CEO of Gallagher Re after a transition period. Kent, formerly the boss of Willis Re, took up his previous post when Gallagher completed the $3.25bn (£2.7bn) takeover in December 2021.
