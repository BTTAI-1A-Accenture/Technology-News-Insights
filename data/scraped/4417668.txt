Business Spotlight 
              India witnessed the advent of the OTT wave around five to six years ago, leading to a multitude of content releases on various streaming platforms. Prominent stars now actively participate in films and series tailored for these platforms. Krishnani, as a producer, eagerly embraces this space and comprehends its unique dynamics.
             Saahil Krishnani, the successful entrepreneur behind Quan Yin Mediaworks Pvt Ltd, popularly known as QY Mediaworks, has embarked on a new journey as a film producer. Building upon the success of his company's diverse services in digital marketing, advertising, media planning, social media, and influencer marketing, Krishnani aims to create enriching content for both theatrical release and streaming on OTT platforms. Expressing his vision as a producer, Krishnani shares, "QY Mediaworks will venture into film production for both theaters and OTT platforms. Certain stories thrive in the immersive big-screen experience, while others find their audience through streaming. In addition to films, we have plans to produce long-format series in the near future. I am thrilled about this new chapter as a producer and aspire to deliver quality entertainment that captivates global audiences." India witnessed the advent of the OTT wave around five to six years ago, leading to a multitude of content releases on various streaming platforms. Prominent stars now actively participate in films and series tailored for these platforms. Krishnani, as a producer, eagerly embraces this space and comprehends its unique dynamics. "When creating content for theaters and streaming platforms, one must understand their distinctions. Certain films are best experienced in theaters, while specific content thrives on OTT platforms. Filmmakers and actors alike now acknowledge this differentiation. For instance, Alia Bhatt's 'Gangubai Kathiawadi' excelled at the box office, while 'Darlings' found remarkable success on OTT," Krishnani explains. Currently, Krishnani is diligently curating a diverse slate of films to be released in the upcoming months. With one project already in production, several others are in the development or pre-production stages. The enterprising entrepreneur turned film producer envisions a steady stream of original content to captivate audiences consistently.
