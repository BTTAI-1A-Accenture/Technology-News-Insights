 KEY POINTS White elephants. Stocking stuffers. Mother's Day holiday cards. I've bought 'em all, and my No. 1 destination for unique, out-of-the-box gifts is Etsy, the go-to marketplace for buying and selling handmade goodies. But all that goodness comes with a cost. Personalization can be pricey, after all. But the online platform has hidden depths with unique gems to mine. Here are six affordable Mother's Day gifts you can discover on Etsy for $25 or less. Send Mom a custom necklace at a reasonable price. The stainless steel piece is super customizable: change the birthstone, number of flowers, and coloring. You can have it engraved with a personal message like "Love ya, Mom" or "Smell you soon" -- whatever floats your boat, really.


 Swap the greeting card for a personalized candle. You can customize the message and scent. It's an excellent gift for scent lovers (and a thoughtful way to freshen up the usual greeting card handover). The candle will burn about 45-50 hours in total. Pair cute with practical by gifting Mom a colorful block of handmade soap. Choose from over a dozen scents like Coconut Milk and Wild Lavender (yum) or, order double and let Mom pick one while you snag the other. It's gentle stuff, so moms with sensitive skin should be okay. Mix things up with a sarcastic Mother's Day card designed by Potty Mouth Press. These minimalist cards are actually funny and leave plenty of room for a personalized message. Consider covering your bases by scribbling "Love u Mom" in the margins (I know I will). Check out quirky Mother's Day cards for quirky moms. They're funny, off-beat, and terribly inappropriate (with exceptions). Perfect for fun-loving moms who don't appreciate your sass, mister. (See No. 4 for sarcasm-loving Moms). All cards are handmade, and shipping is free. The ultimate Mother's Day cheat: an immortal floral that requires zero care and acquires zero tears. These handmade paper flowers are repurposed from books, perfect for book lovers or moms with a bookish aesthetic. Not every mom has a green thumb; now, she doesn't have to. Give Mom a meaningful gift without breaking into your savings account, the grown-up's proverbial piggy bank. All the prices listed above are full price, but many are on sale for Mother's Day. Consider checking out with a cash back card to get back a 1%-5% bonus on your purchase. Etsy lists meaningful gifts for all the moms in your life. Check out these pre-packaged Mother's Day offerings sooner rather than later to snag discounts, free shipping, and timely delivery.
