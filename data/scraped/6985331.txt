After Noel Gallagher labelled The 1975 's**t' and 'certainly not rock', he went on to call Matty Healy a ‘slack-jawed f**kwit’ - and now the musician has had a stab back Matty Healy has bitten back at Noel Gallagher after the music legend's recent savage attack on him.   The unlikely beef between the rockers stemmed from an interview last month, in which the 56-year-old Oasis icon branded The 1975 singer "a slack-jawed f*ckwit" and his band "s**t".  It was a no-nonsense retort to Matty's previous claims that Noel and his brother Liam should set aside their differences and reunite. Noel also revealed his angry reaction to The 1975 winning in the Best Rock category at the BRIT Awards. But Matty has now taken a swipe back, saying he only 'writes albums to promote his interviews'.  Noel told NME in May: "I was watching it with my kids, two teenage lads, thinking, ‘Is it me being a grumpy old man, or is this sh*t?’ They were both going, ‘Oh no, this is f****g s**t’.  "The 1975, Best Rock Band? Someone needs to re-define that immediately, because that is… I don’t know what that is, but it’s certainly not f****g rock. Whatever rock is, that’s not it." On stage last night in Dublin, Ireland, the musician revealed Coldplay’s Chris Martin and U2's Bono had been remarkably supportive in recent week. Then the attention turned to the Noel who hasn't been as nice. He told fans: “Noel Gallagher called me a ‘slack-jawed f**kwit’… I love Noel Gallagher. We asked Liam to open up and he said he would have done it but he was busy. “But I love Noel Gallagher… He’s just getting on,” he added. “The difference between me and Noel is that I do a series of interviews to promote an album, whereas he does an album to promote a series of interviews.” Then he told his rival: “But we love you Noel. Get Oasis back together!”  Matty reportedly wanted to 'settle down' with Taylor Swift prior to their reported break-up recently, with him said to have been seeing a "long-term future" with her.   It was reported on Monday that Taylor and Matty had ended their rumoured relationship, with a source later telling the Mirror that the pair "still care" for each other.  A source had toldCloser magazine: "Matty's telling the world this is the real deal - they're building a long-term future, and marriage and kids are his goal, assuming it all works out." The source however said at the time that Taylor's friends were under the impression that it was a "rebound" relationship that has the "potential for something more". It was further claimed by the source that Matty was trying to "play things coy" in public but that he wasn't "holding back" while talking about it with his loved ones. Celeb obsessed?
