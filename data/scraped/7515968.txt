EPL The rain was pouring in Soweto and the Dobsonville Stadium pitch — one of only two venues in the South African city of Johannesburg used to stage the 2011 Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations — was becoming more uneven by the minute. Yet there was a player in the red of Egypt who glided past the opposition as if it were a bowling green. His name was Mohamed Salah, and aspiring talent spotter Jeremy Seethal was busy scribbling down notes on the 18-year-old. Advertisement Seethal, a South African, is now based in Egypt where he leads recruitment at Right to Dream Africa, a multi-club group of academies. Twelve years ago he was 26 years old and doing volunteer coaching and scouting for Ajax Cape Town, while also sending reports from youth tournaments to European clubs. For that Under-20s AFCON, he tagged along with Manchester City scout Joe Mulberry. While there, he compiled a list of who he considered the top 10 players in the competition. Number one was Nigerian striker Olarenwaju Kayode, who was signed by City in 2017 and is now at Turkey’s Umraniyespor, on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine. Number two was Salah. GO DEEPER Jordan Henderson: I strongly believe that me playing in Saudi Arabia is a positive thing “He was on the right wing, running at high speed, shaping to shoot, then cutting in and caressing it in the corner. All the things you see him do now (for Liverpool),” Seethal tells The Athletic. “He was special, but it’s difficult to distinguish what elite level looks like. The big clubs didn’t know about Salah, so I recommended him to Ajax, PSV and Manchester United. I either never heard back at all or I received an email saying, ‘Thanks, we’ll pass it on’, but there was no feedback ever given.” Seethal has a track record, having brought Ajax’s Mohammed Kudus, Kamaldeen Sulemana of Southampton and Brighton’s Simon Adingra to Right to Dream — which is now widely recognised as the pinnacle of African youth football. However, his experience with European clubs has been that they usually pay only lip service to the game in Africa. Get ready for the scoop ! Better boiiii @KudusMohammedGH Congrats Kudus on all your hard work and perseverance. Well done team RTD & Fcn ❤️ https://t.co/tgaXc9K1A7 — Jeremy Seethal 🇿🇦 (@jeremy_seethal) July 16, 2020  After earning a scouting role with Manchester City to keep tabs on African players already in Europe, he pushed Sadio Mane as the top talent at French second-tier club Metz in 2012. “City thought he was too lightweight, but he was doing things that were very unpredictable,” Seethal says. “I couldn’t understand why most European scouts would overlook them (African players). Now I realise African scouting is nuanced and there are subtleties which can put off European clubs.” Advertisement Seethal’s experiences are indicative of the wider attitude towards Africa within football. For this article, The Athletic spoke to dozens of scouts and agents across Africa and Europe. To their knowledge, not one club has more than a single scout based in Africa; and if they have one at all, they are an outlier. Belgium and France were, for a long time, the main European entry point for African players due to the shared language from the two countries’ colonial pasts and their less-stringent migration laws. Metz entered into an exclusive arrangement with Senegalese academy Generation Foot in 2003 and have invested around £1million every year, developing Ismaila Sarr, Diafra Sakho, Habib Diallo and Mane in the process. Belgian club Beveren were the first to seriously attack the African market when they signed a raft of players from Ivory Coast around the millennium, including Yaya Toure. It was a policy inspired by technical director Jean-Marc Guillou, who set up the academy ASEC Mimosas, which then-Premier League side Charlton Athletic partnered with in 2006. Red Bull set up an academy in Ghana but later pulled its resources, so now tap into Guillou’s connections and use former Mali and Sevilla striker Freddie Kanoute’s company 12 Management as its other path in. France’s OGC Nice and Ivorian club Abidjan also have a link. But most Belgian and French sides don’t have an established route. “Many clubs don’t have anyone in Africa, but we recently invested in a structure there to target some countries that don’t have any European club presence,” Samuel Cardenas, sporting director at Belgium’s Gent, tells The Athletic. Cardenas cites a lack of video and data, difficulty in validating birth dates, agent representation and club officials as the main barriers in the past. He also makes the point that not all African leagues have lots of young talent playing in them, while the manpower costs of travelling there compared to Europe makes it expensive. Advertisement “Most clubs have skeleton staff — it’s two to five people at most Belgian clubs doing recruitment. England is really extreme in that it has an industry, with many full-time jobs,” Cardenas says. “Without having someone on the ground, clubs can get scared. So that’s why I identified someone we trust to coordinate our scouting in Africa now.” So why has no English club heavily invested yet? Until last month, the reason has been a simple one in that work-permit rules have made it basically impossible to sign any players directly from Africa as the auto-pass route is not available to those from countries outside the top 50 in FIFA’s rankings: only Morocco (13), Senegal (19), Tunisia (31), Algeria (33), Egypt (34), Nigeria (39), Cameroon (43) and Mali (50) make the cut there. And then the eligible players need to have played over 60 per cent of their senior national team’s minutes in the last year. One top Premier League scout, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their position, like several others in this piece, said that the recent relaxing of the rules to allow clubs between two and four signings as exemptions could change things. GO DEEPER FA confirms new rules over overseas transfers Another said there is some complacency when scouting at source in a less-common market and that cognitive bias may be at play when judging players too. “It is an untapped market, but most English clubs have so much money that they will wait until the players transition into Europe, or wait until they get to France and Belgium, then buy them (from there). It may cost £5million or £10million (rather than getting them cheaper from African sides) but it is less risk,” he says. The rise of the multi-club model could also be a game-changer in this regard. “We are going to be buying more feeder clubs and we are soon going to start going to Africa and scouting (for) ourselves,” says a Premier League recruitment chief. “Right now, we like going to big competitions where you can see a thousand players in a few days, but at the moment it’s only once they have moved to Europe then we would get interested. Advertisement “It’s going to get to the point that if you’re not in a multi-club network you’ll be at a big disadvantage.” Brentford and Denmark’s Midtjylland, both owned by Matthew Benham, benefit from links with Nigerian club FC Ebedei. Midtjylland signed Paul Onuachu from Ebedei and sold him to Genk for a big profit, and also found Frank Onyeka and sold him on to sister side Brentford, showing how the multi-club model could work with each level used as a testing ground. Midtjylland recently purchased a Portuguese second division side, CD Mafra, to become part of their chain, and they have already begun developing some of their young talents on loan. “How exciting is it that, for the first time that I can remember, we can actually go and sign players from Africa aged 18? That’s scary,” Brentford technical director Lee Dykes told The Athletic’s Access All Areas documentary. “We can start now looking out into Africa and taking wildcard opportunities if you like (…) and bring them into the area directly, which is going to be good for us. But it’s going to be massive for Africa as well, because they will start to see the benefits more financially.” Access All Areas: Brentford 🐝 🔹 How they recruit and scout players🔹 Data… but don't call it Moneyball🔹 Their remarkable rise up the pyramid Introducing @jaydmharris' exclusive behind the scenes podcast series. 🎧 Free to listen everywhere: https://t.co/1xQHxLdwdS pic.twitter.com/I04OndIwv5 — The Athletic | Football (@TheAthleticFC) July 24, 2023  It could be a turning point, as The Athletic understands that Sport Republic, owners of Southampton in the Championship, Turkish club Goztepe and French second-tier side Valenciennes, is also setting up a scouting network in Africa. Scandinavia particularly is targeting Africa more and more, and Sweden’s Hammarby are cited as one of the most successful clubs in that market, with Ghanian Joseph Aidoo, Akinkunmi Amoo (Nigeria) and Odilon Kossounou (Ivory Coast) bringing in upwards of €25million in the past two years having been signed directly from Africa. Advertisement Another Swedish side, IFK in Gothenburg, have also struck up a relationship with Nigerian academy Tiki Taki. Midfielder Alhassan Yusuf was the first talent to come through, after being spotted at a showcase game. He went to Belgium’s Royal Antwerp in 2021. Football agent Atta Aneke has carved a reputation as the go-to man for identifying African talent and bringing them to Sweden and Norway, having first brought Odion Ighalo from Nigeria to Oslo club Lyn in 2007. In recent years his biggest deals have included taking Nigerian striker Gift Orban from that country’s Bison FC to Norwegian club Stabaek, who in turn sold him to Genk for over €3million less than a year later and could stand to make a huge profit if he moves again this summer — a number of major European clubs, including Lille, are interested. Aneke also brought David Fofana from Ivorian side Abidjan to Molde in Norway, before he moved to Chelsea in January this year for around £10million. Belgian club Anderlecht’s assistant manager Ian Burchnall established a good working relationship with Aneke during his time at Sarpsborg, Viking (both Norway) and Ostersund (Sweden). At the former, he signed Aaron Olanare from Nigeria and sold him on to China’s Guangzhou City for around €1.4million, and that success meant when he got a call from Aneke offering to bring two young talents to Viking free of charge on a month’s trial, he trusted him. Most clubs recognise the untapped potential of Africa but cite barriers to entry as the reason they don’t have a scouting presence to match it. The most crucial is that despite Wyscout being the dominant video service for clubs, providing footage of virtually every league in Europe, South America and Asia, the only premier African leagues regularly covered are the ones in Egypt, Ghana and Morocco. And even those three aren’t covered comprehensively. One Premier League scout shared with The Athletic what he says to prospective middlemen: “I told them that if they create a Wyscout platform that had mass coverage of leagues in Africa with all the footage of the leagues, as tricky as that might be, it would make their business a must-have for every club.” Advertisement There are companies embarking on that very ambition now. Delphlyx is a video platform that launched in Africa four months ago and covers five senior leagues in west Africa, with plans to expand to another nine this season. “The reason we built this platform is that it’s the most undervalued market in world football,” says founder Thomas Randolph. “We’ve met with every elite club in world football and until now they are scouting Africa in two ways: through agents or by watching international youth tournaments. “Without our platform, clubs have no autonomy, they have limited information to decide on a player presented by an agent and it’s a purely reactive market.” Delphlyx currently offers highlights packages and a consultancy service in which it recommends 10 players a month to certain clubs, as opposed to granular footage that they can sift through themselves. It also has a database of information on every player in the leagues when it comes to birth dates, minutes played and performance metrics. Those did not exist in any accessible form beforehand, so the aim is to give European clubs a first filter of the African market to help make their on-the-ground scouting more efficient. Randolph only employs Africans to do the data collecting and filming as he believes that for too long clubs have not invested in their unique knowledge of leagues and understanding of how things work compared to Europe. These local experts also have inherent knowledge of how scalable African talent is, whereas European clubs can be hesitant in making a concrete move until players have risen to a higher level of the game. Gambian striker Adama Bojang is one of those players. The 18-year-old has been playing in the Gambian league for two years and was available for around €100,000. By the Under-20 AFCON in February and March this year, he was worth around €600,000. After he scored a couple of goals in the U20 World Cup in May and June he was worth seven figures, which France’s Reims have paid. “Each level of proof adds another multiplier to the price,” says MRKT Insights co-founder Tim Keech. MRKT worked with about 20 partner clubs globally providing scouting consultancy packages, but six months ago it formed a new joint venture with experienced Nigerian scouts to provide European clubs with video and data of Nigerian players. Advertisement Unlike Delphlyx, MRKT is involved in recommending players and arranging trials at clubs. From his dialogue with clubs, Keech recognises the scepticism when it comes to judging the level, but he used Victor Boniface, a Nigerian forward who just moved from Union Saint-Gilloise in Belgium to Germany’s Bayer Leverkusen for €20million, as a learning tool for his scouts. “We found some old video clips of Boniface playing grassroots football in Lagos’ regional league as a teenager,” Keech says. “We asked our clubs and even our own scouts what the feedback would be and they said it was hard to judge or make a recommendation due to the perceived level, but this is a top European level footballer just five years later. “There are plenty of others coming out of these leagues, so we have to get comfortable with it.” MRKT has eight trusted people on the ground building relationships, so it has a competitive advantage in the market for its partner clubs. Having built some foundations in the past six months, MRKT is aiming to support the best projects in Nigeria and establish a permanent office there. “We need to be able to say more than, ‘He’s an interesting player’. We will have at least five or six full games of video available and know what the deal looks like — which has to be fair to the Nigerian clubs,” says Keech. “We are pre-vetting the players, rather than putting on thousands of untagged games, though, as that’s no use to anyone.” Football works differently in Nigeria and MRKT’s partners were able to set up a tournament last month in Lagos, the country’s biggest city, that lots of the best local teams came to at very short notice. The teams want their players to be seen and so this gives them the game film to show to clubs. The logic became obvious to Keech when his company visited Nigeria and discovered that the old culture of street football in Britain is very much alive and kicking there. Entrepreneurial coaches are also setting up academies and filming games on their own in a bid to showcase local talent to the world. Advertisement This is where another company, operating exclusively in the arena of youth football, comes into play: Eyeball. Essentially, it is a Wyscout platform for youth football, which is how it was deliberately designed after consulting with scouts. Clubs are provided with a 7.5m (24ft) high camera setup to film the games for free in return for the footage being sent onto the platform, which professional clubs can access. The camera covers the full pitch and has the technology to instantly identify every player, tagging each movement and action performed so scouts can filter through the clips. The nature of the business model means there are far fewer financial barriers for African clubs than usual. “That’s all we ask. In return we’ll provide your boys with a window to the world,” says founder David Hicks. He and his business partner have invested £5million in the business and have 60 partner clubs in Europe paying monthly subscriptions for access to the videos on 10-year contracts. It costs €1,000 per month for a club to have full access to every league Eyeball covers in Africa, a database of 8,000 players which starts at under-14s level — less than a return flight from Europe for one traditional scouting trip to the continent. Eyeball — motto: “Talent is everywhere” — covers 300 games a week in France, its primary location, but also works in Scandinavia and eastern Europe. In west Africa, it is into its second season and has established blanket coverage of the top leagues and academies. This ability to monitor young African players for three or four years before they reach 18 is something that has not been possible before now. Six of the 11 players in the Under-17 AFCON team of the tournament this spring are on Eyeball’s system and earlier this month Ghanaian striker Jalal Abdulai moved from partner club Inter Allies FC Ghana to another client, Elfsborg in Sweden. Advertisement Another 18-year-old Ghanaian, Christopher Bonsu Baah, went from Shooting Stars to Sarpsborg six months ago and has just joined Genk in a multi-million-pound deal. El Bilal Toure went from Malian club Africa Football Elite to Reims for free in 2020, signed for Spain’s Almeria in 2022, and has just completed a move to Atalanta in Italy for €28million. By far the biggest success story, however, is Senegalese centre-back Mikayil Faye who moved from Diambars in that country to Croatian second-division club NK Kustosija in February and, after eight games, won a move to Spanish champions Barcelona. Diambars this week sold Ousmane Dip to another of Eyeball’s partner clubs, France’s Troyes — part of the City Football Group. A Day to Remember!😍 pic.twitter.com/OaPCq38pID — Mikayil Faye (@MikayilFaye) June 19, 2023  Right to Dream (RTD) recently purchased TUT FC in Egypt and San Diego FC in the U.S., launching academies in both territories and taking the original concept a long way from its foundation in Ghana 24 years ago. Rather than a club buying an academy in Africa, RTD’s owner Tom Vernon inverted the pyramid and purchased Danish club Nordsjaelland (FCN) in 2015. Since combining the two academies, they have produced 146 professional players, while 67 male and female graduates have represented their countries at senior international level. Nordsjaelland’s squad now comprises 66 per cent RTD players and they have boasted the youngest team in Europe for the last five years, finishing second in the Danish league last season. RTD scouts over 110,000 young people across five countries in over 180 communities every year. It employs five core scouts and around 20 coordinators, so there is investment. However, as far as secrets to success go, Seethal points to education being an equal focus rather than solely existing as a talent farm. It also helps that the key leaders in the company are emotionally invested in Africa as they live there, got married there and raised kids in African culture. Coaches tend to stick around, too, so Kudus’ under-11s coach now develops other coaches to ensure they have the best talent nurturers around. From the age of 16, the boys at the RTD and Nordsjaelland academies regularly travel to meet each other and form a blended squad, which means the best players, those who eventually make it, have been integrated into the culture come their first-team debut. Fantastic Start! ⚽️@FCNordsjaelland opened the 2023/24 season with a 4-1 win, featuring a hat-trick from Right to Dream Academy graduate Ernest Nuamah! 🌟 pic.twitter.com/AgmNAUYhHb — Right to Dream (@right2dream) July 25, 2023  RTD has expanded to Egypt where it will now look to replicate what it has done in Ghana on a bigger scale. The 100 million population, strong footballing culture and a pay-to-play model which excludes a big part of the population were the three decisive factors in choosing the second location. Seethal is aware that City Football Group or Clearlake (part of the consortium which bought Chelsea and now also own French Ligue 1 side Strasbourg) could buy up an academy in most countries in Africa and their global brand would hold sway, but he would back RTD to withstand any wave of investment. Advertisement “Scouting in Africa is very different from Europe. The rates of development differ around the continent. It requires years of benchmarking, development and care for how players will transition to be successful,” Seethal says. “We have a proven model of care. FCN is the ninth-most profitable club in the world in terms of transfers and at the foundation of this is getting our scouting right. “We get to understand the kids as people growing up, even if they don’t go down the professional route. Scouts go to the villages of the boys we sign, so they understand them and grow closer to the player. We hand over in-depth dossiers and approach African scouting with the respect the child and continent deserves.” Seethal’s final point is to say that European clubs are correct to view Africa as being different to anywhere else they can find players. He appreciates its complexities, but also the different types of talent the continent can produce via less organised football and less systematic coaching. “Yes, it is tough terrain to scout in, but merely sending down a European scout every few months is also a mistake,” he says. “European scouts scout for what they don’t have, and if you approach Africa solely with this mindset you will scout on emotion the moment you land and that is the first trap. “I missed (Southampton’s Malian midfielder Moussa) Djnepo as I thought he was too raw but I learned from it and made sure I got Adingra. “I saw him playing as a 16-year-old in an RTD tournament in Accra (Ghana’s capital). I organised a match with this team from Benin and he did well, so came to train. He couldn’t understand passing patterns and the coach called me to ask about him. I told him to do one-v-ones and call me back. An hour later I got a call saying, ‘This guy is unbelievable’. Look at him now.” Advertisement The talent is there to be polished. It just needs clubs to be there too to see it, but that will take bold leaders. Most believe that once it happens, the herd will follow. Additional reporting: Jay Harris and Jacob Tanswell.
