Good things are brewing for Fashion TV Cafe in Lucknow since they've entered the new year with a bang. Following their fresh establishment and showcasing a rather trendy and positive aura, they have now won the esteemed Latte Art Championship Throwdown, organised by KAAPI Machines. Held on January 23 in Lucknow, the competition represents the best of Baristas across town. Here, all the big names of Lucknow fought amongst each other to create perfect latte art patterns. However, it was FTV Cafe that stood apart and hurtled their way across the top. FashionTV Cafe (the franchise of its international counterpart) had opened its doors last month for every one with a taste for all things great in life! Offering a luxurious experience at reasonable rates, the FTV Café stands for everything fresh and healthy. Occupying a spacious yet snug corner in Kisan Bazaar, the place is a recent addition to the blooming café culture in Lucknow and is one of those names that strike the mind whenever hangout scenes are discussed! Latte art, being one of recognisable symbols that tells apart the coffee culture of a place, judges the coffee's adequate texture, taste, design, and so on. FTV Cafe is known for its best-selling coffee made of freshly roasted beans. The snazzy place surpasses expectations in its food sector, too. From the hale salads to sandwiches, from garden fresh Power bowls to vegan smoothies, FTV Cafe will have your back when it comes to a healthy and chill outing!
