Lab-Aids Partners with Michigan State University to Publish Connected Mathematics4 New York-based Lab-Aids, which publishes and manufactures hands-on, evidence-based science programs, has started a partnership with Michigan State University in East Lansing to publish the fourth edition of the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) curriculum. Developed at MSU with support from the National Science Foundation, CMP is widely used in middle grades classrooms across the United States and several foreign countries. âFor over 60 years we have held fast to the belief that students best learn science through real world issues and problems with relevant and relatable content,â says Jonathan Atkins, president of Lab-Aids. âWe are elated to partner with Michigan State University who has spent the past 30 years proving this approach also works best for students in mathematics.â CMPâs guiding philosophy has been that students can make sense of mathematics if the concepts and skills are embedded within contextual problems. If time is spent exploring interesting mathematics situations, reflecting on solution methods, examining why the methods work, comparing methods, and relating methods to those used in previous situations, then students are likely to build more robust understandings of mathematical concepts and related procedures. A problem-centered curriculum not only helps students to make sense of the mathematics, but also helps them to process the mathematics in a retrievable way, the partners say. University of Detroit Mercy, GM Partner to Build Tomorrowâs Leaders University of Detroit Mercy and General Motors Co. in Detroit joined forces to host the GM Student Corps/UDM College Experience event on July 11 at the schoolâs McNichols Campus. Nearly 100 students from 14 high schools in southeast Michigan participated in the event that provided a walkthrough of a typical day in the life of a college student. They learned about the significance of navigating the higher education journey through topics like financial aid, class schedules, and more. Students also participated in hands-on learning experiences with UDM faculty from the College of Liberal Arts & Education. By collaborating with Detroit Mercy, GM says it aims to inspire and empower these students by highlighting the transformative power of education and equipping them with the knowledge and tools necessary to pursue higher education. âEngaging in a real college classroom where students solve a cybercrime, create an electronic puppet, and learn their leadership style gives them the chance to experience the exciting and transformative opportunities available at universities such as Detroit Mercy, where we can help make their hopes become realities,â says Jocelyn M. Boryczka, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Education at UDM. The GM Student Corps was founded in 2013 by GM President Mark Reuss and a group of GM employees and retirees, including UDM alumnus Mike DiGiovanni as part of a commitment to advance education, jumpstart student careers, and support the community. The goal of the GM Student Corps is to develop professional skills in the students, engage them in their communities and provide mentors and guidance as they progress. GM hires approximately eight students from 14 different high schools across metro Detroit, Flint, and Pontiac to participate in the corps. These high school interns are paired with a college intern and two GM retirees who serve as mentors during the summer program and beyond. High school interns attend training to develop skills such as business etiquette, networking, and financial literacy. Each team works together to select and manage its own community service project that benefit their schools, neighbors, and community.

Fair Food Network in Detroit Urges Congress to Expand Nutrition Initiatives The Fair Food Network in Detroit joins more than 600 farm, food, and health leaders urging key Congressional leaders to strengthen and expand the successful Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program (GusNIP) in the 2023 Farm Bill so it can help more families, farmers, and food businesses across the country. âIn order to benefit more local economies and help more families improve dietary quality, GusNIP needs to evolve and grow so it can reach its full potential,â wrote the groups. âWith robust funding and improvements to support the partners who deliver this program, GusNIP can expand its reach to help even more American farmers, grocers, and families experiencing poverty nationwide.â Since its inception as a pilot program in 2008, GusNIP has worked as an effective public-private partnership that has expanded healthy food choices and sparked economic opportunity. The program supports nutrition incentive projects at the state level, which enable families who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to use their benefits to buy more fruits and vegetables at participating farmers markets and grocery stores. GusNIP also supports produce prescriptions that allow healthcare providers to give their patients vouchers to buy fresh produce so they can add more healthy food to their diet. Editor: R.J. King
