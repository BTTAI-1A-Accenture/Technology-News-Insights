            The “Star Wars” actress died on December 27, 2016, as a result of “sleep apnea and other undetermined factors,” the Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office determined. 
 
            She was 60 years old. 
     
            Her role as Princess Leia is iconic and it feels right that she will posthumously be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 4 this year.
