 Getting the right appointment can always be confusing, especially when you are unsure of whom to meet. This article will give you the first steps to meet your hearing professional and have your hearing difficulties addressed. If you are well in yourself, but have noticed a gradual and progressive decline in your hearing - Make an appointment with your GP and request for an appointment with your local NHS trust Audiology department. This may take a while, but since there are no other comorbidities, this should be okay. In this case, you also have the alternative to visit a private hearing healthcare professional. There are multiple high street hearing professionals who offer hearing loss diagnostic and rehabilitation services. This is a much faster albeit expensive way to go about your hearing test and to get fitted with hearing aids if need be.  If you have a sudden drop in your hearing, either partial or complete and without any signs of pain, ear discharge or infections then this is something that needs to be adressed quite urgently. Request an emergency appointment with your GP, either the same day or the next and you will be referred to the Ear, Nose and Throat consultant on a priority basis.  If you experience any signs of an ear infection such as a pressure build-up behind the eardrum, any fluid within the ear or ear discharge or a sharp/throbbing pain in the ear, dizzy spells or vertigo and this is accompanied by a drop in hearing - this needs to be seen by your GP so that appropriate antibiotics may be prescribed to you. Additionally, a referral to the NHS Audiology department may be made by your doctor if deemed necessary.  Disclaimer: It is important to understand that these are just some guidelines to help you understand the basic framework or pathways to get an Audiology appointment based on the symptoms that you may be facing, and in no way does this substitute medical advice.
