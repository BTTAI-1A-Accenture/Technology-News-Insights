Griffin said in an interview to Bloomberg on November 16: “China, given the size of its capital markets, is a center of focus for our investment team.”  Ken Griffin observed that resilient growth in China could reduce the risk of a significant recession in 2023 in the world’s second-largest economy.

But even recurring revenue businesses enabling digital transformation are not immune from the vagaries of the COVID-19 recovery. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) (-12.8%) has detracted from results due to slowing revenue growth driven by a combination of factors, including pull-forward of enterprise digitization demand during COVID-19, some operational missteps, and lengthening sales cycles. We believe the company still has ample room for revenue growth across its various platforms and should benefit from budget consolidation as customers seek control over tech spending in a weakening economy.
