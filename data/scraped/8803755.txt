 Private and Corporate Utilities : Newsletter 69, by David Lipschitz BSc (Honours) MBA - A consultant working at the intersection of energy and business.  David: Would you agree with the following statement and can you discuss the energy transitions we've had: We have had a few energy transitions and in none of them have we used less of the previous fuel.Would you agree with the following statement and can you discuss the energy transitions we've had:We have had a few energy transitions and in none of them have we used less of the previous fuel.  #ChatGPT:  The history of energy transitions is complex, and it's worth noting that while the overall use of a particular energy source might increase even after a new source is introduced, the relative proportion of that source compared to others can decrease. Here's a breakdown of major energy transitions: Each energy transition includes periods where use of both the old and new energy source grows, as the new source doesn't instantly replace the old one but adds to overall energy availability. This is due in part to increasing energy demand from growing economies and populations. However, over time, the new source typically takes a greater share of the total energy mix. As we move further into the 21st century, the aim of many nations is not just to change the relative shares of different energy sources, but to reduce the absolute use of fossil fuels to combat climate change. This is a distinctive feature of the current energy transition and may break the pattern seen in earlier transitions. Achieving this will likely require significant advances in energy efficiency and changes in consumption patterns.
