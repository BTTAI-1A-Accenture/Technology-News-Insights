Great Northwest Wine News, reviews and info about the wines of Washington, Oregon, British Columbia and Idaho December 31, 2022 by Great Northwest Wine Leave a Comment  The “tall tales” are a tribute to the stories shared by co-owner Corey Braunel’s Grandpa Fred, but few examples from the plantings in The Rocks of the Walla Walla Valley can match the balance, approachability and tell-tale Syrah markers vintage after vintage as Dusted Valley’s work from its Stoney Vine Vineyard near Milton-Freewater, Ore. Its unmistakably Syrah starting with the nose of spicy blue fruit — think dark plum, blueberry and black pepper with cola and horehound in the background. There’s a stream of fruit across the palate with plum jam, blackberry and smoked cherry flavors wrapped by richness and a pleasing but not distracting amount of funkiness. The finish is juicy and not drying while including dashes of pepper and allspice. Of the three Syrahs released each vintage by these Wisconsin natives, the Tall Tales typically is the one that’s lapped up first by their Stained Tooth Society.
