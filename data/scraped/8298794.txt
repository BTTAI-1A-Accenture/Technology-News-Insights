Known globally for its integration with Google Workspace, Google Drive also enables direct hard drive synchronization through Google Backup and Sync, or Drive File Stream for Workspace users. Egnyte: automated file sync for risk reduction 
Egnyte offers a modern file sync solution, specially built for businesses focusing on risk and cost reduction. It highlights risks and identifies data owners with its Content Intelligence Engine, and enables rapid scanning for PII to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.  Dropbox: a robust solution for businesses
Dropbox isn't the cheapest at $9.99 per user monthly, but it offers a comprehensive business solution. The Team plan features admin login, audit logs, granular sharing permissions, and secure file transfers. Unique innovations like LAN syncing for faster sharing and Smart Sync for file viewing without local storage make it stand out.  Our expert review: Google Drive almost needs no introduction; thanks to the popularity and widespread adoption of Google Workspace, it’s one of the most widely used file-sharing platforms on the planet.  Google has rebranded some of its services, merging the functionalities of Google Backup and Sync with Drive File Stream into a single, more efficient application called Google Drive for desktop. This change means you now have a streamlined process for syncing files across your devices, whether you're a personal user or part of a larger business operation using Google Workspace. With Google Drive for desktop, you can expect a more integrated experience. For instance, you can now sync photos and videos to Google Photos and Google Drive simultaneously, which wasn't as straightforward before. This integration simplifies managing your digital assets across Google's platforms. Another significant improvement is the option to mirror Drive files on your local device. This means files are stored both on your computer and in the cloud, allowing for faster access to frequently used documents and reducing online data usage. However, this can take up significant hard drive space, so it's worth considering how it aligns with your storage capabilities and needs. Google has also enhanced its collaboration tools within Google Drive. Features like blocking downloads, prints, or copies of specific files have become invaluable for users looking to share content securely. The ability to work offline on Docs, Sheets, and Slides then automatically sync your changes once you're back online ensures that you can work from anywhere, anytime, without interruption. However, it's worth noting that while Google Drive offers a robust platform for file sharing and syncing, its advanced functionality, such as granular permission settings or detailed audit trails, may not satisfy users with more sophisticated enterprise-level needs. Additionally, while Google Drive's search functionality is powerful, navigating a very large volume of files can sometimes feel less intuitive than some might hope. Read our Google Drive review.  Our expert review: Egnyte is a file sync solution built for modern businesses, with a focus on risk and cost reduction for teams of all sizes.  One of Egnyte’s core technologies is the Content Intelligence Engine, which automatically classifies your data to highlight risk, locate regulated or proprietary files, and easily identify data owners.  You can rapidly scan for personally identifiable information (PII), to stay compliant with GDPR (the General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (the California Consumer Privacy Act), and other regulations, and use pre-configured policies to ensure compliance with SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), and other industry standards.  Automation is another big part of Egnyte’s appeal: picking up on and responding to unusual behavior, and automating file management, like archiving and deletion, data retention and legal holds, and privileging hot or cold storage.  Egnyte has streamlined its dashboard and file management systems, making it easier for you to navigate and manage your files and folders. Egnyte now offers enhanced project folders. These project folders allow teams to work together more effectively, with features designed to streamline project management, such as task assignments, progress tracking, and automated workflows. It has also expanded its integration ecosystem. Egnyte now offers more integrations with leading software like Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Trello. This means you can seamlessly work with files stored on Egnyte directly from within these apps, enhancing productivity and collaboration across your team. Egnyte's mobile app has also seen improvements, offering better functionality and a more user-friendly experience. This ensures that you and your team can access, share, and manage files securely from anywhere, at any time, directly from your mobile devices. Businesses looking to lock down compliance, eliminate data risks, and benefit from automation should definitely consider Egnyte, with plans starting at $10 per user a month for teams of 1-10 users. Read our comprehensive Egnyte review.  Our expert review: Dropbox is another popular backup and sync solution which has made great strides in providing a robust yet simple business solution. However, plans start at $9.99 per user a month, so it’s not the cheapest solution on this list.  The Team plan includes an admin login to manage multiple users and teams, with an audit log and granular sharing permissions. File transfers are secured with 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption, although encryption keys are held by Dropbox.  There are some clever innovations at work here, too. LAN syncing searches for files on local servers before the cloud, to speed up sharing, while Smart Sync enables you to see files without having to store them locally.  One of the notable recent additions is the integration of Dropbox with leading communication and collaboration tools. This means you can now work on Dropbox files directly through Slack or Zoom, streamlining workflows and reducing the need for switching between apps. This is a big plus if you're working in a team or managing one, as it simplifies collaboration significantly. Another significant update is the introduction of Dropbox Passwords for all paid plans. This password manager stores and autofills your passwords across all devices, making it easier to manage access to your services without compromising on security. Coupled with Dropbox Vault, a feature designed to store sensitive personal information with an additional layer of security, Dropbox is pushing the boundaries of what we expect from a file syncing solution. All in all, Dropbox is a thoroughly tested, well-trusted, industry-leading solution, with plenty of business features to help your team get more done, faster.  Read our Dropbox Business review and Dropbox review.  Our expert review: If your business extensively uses Microsoft Office, you may find that OneDrive for Business is your best option. This is especially true now that Microsoft has released free, online versions of World, Excel, and PowerPoint so that outside collaborators without Office can easily view and edit files. Of course, OneDrive for Business works seamlessly with the Office apps, so finding your files, accessing version history, and conflict resolution all work flawlessly with Microsoft’s productivity suite.  The OneDrive mobile app also stands out, seamlessly integrating with the suite’s other mobile apps, and includes a handy feature for scanning physical documents like whiteboards or business cards.  If you're navigating through a sea of files daily, the new AI features in OneDrive for Business can really help. It offers intelligent search capabilities that go beyond simple keyword matching, using machine learning to understand the content of your files and how they're related to your work habits. This means finding the document you need becomes faster and more intuitive, even if you can't remember the exact name. With the increasing threats to data security, Microsoft has bolstered OneDrive with advanced security measures like sensitivity labels. These labels allow you to classify and protect your documents based on their content and the level of confidentiality required.  OneDrive now also offers a more robust audit trail feature, which is perfect for businesses that need to comply with regulations like GDPR. You can track who accessed a document, what changes were made, and when, giving you a clearer oversight of your data. Collaboration in OneDrive for Business has also seen improvements, particularly with the integration of Microsoft Teams. You can now work on documents directly within Teams, facilitating real-time collaboration that's more seamless than ever.  Lastly, Microsoft has introduced a "Known Folder Move" feature to OneDrive for Business. This feature automatically backs up and syncs your Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders to OneDrive, ensuring that all your important files are protected and accessible from anywhere. If your business doesn’t use Microsoft Office, OneDrive’s appeal is greatly reduced. However, if you’re looking for simple, “it just works” file syncing for Office collaboration, look no further. Plans start at $5 a month and include Microsoft 365. Read our OneDrive for Business review.  Our expert review: Sync.com is one of the most complete file-syncing solutions out there in terms of features and has a great interface that’s intuitive and easy to use. As if that weren’t enough, it’s also one of the cheapest solutions out there, with business plans starting at just $6 per user a month.  Sync.com was built with collaboration in mind. You can send and receive files to non-Sync users, and control access with passwords and expiry dates, making out-of-company collaborations a breeze. Activity logs let you know what’s going on with each of your shared files, while advanced version history makes it easy to retrieve deleted or changed files.  It also integrates with popular apps like Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Cloud. A central administrative account also makes it easy to add and remove employee accounts, reset passwords, see activity, and manage billing.  Sync.com now offers end-to-end encryption on all plans, ensuring that your files are secure from the moment they leave your device until they reach their destination.  Another update worth mentioning is the introduction of the Sync Vault, a feature that allows you to store files online without syncing them to all your devices. This is particularly useful for freeing up space on your devices while still keeping your files accessible in the cloud. Sync.com has also expanded its device compatibility, now offering improved apps for iOS and Android, alongside its desktop applications. These mobile apps have been refined for better usability, allowing you to access, share, and manage your files on the go with greater ease.  For businesses, Sync.com has introduced more granular control over sharing and collaboration. Administrators can now set folder permissions at a more detailed level, controlling who can view, edit, or share files within specific folders. In summation, Sync.com is an intuitive file-syncing solution with rock-bottom prices for businesses looking for something that “just works”.  Read our Sync.com review.  Our expert review: Syncplicity is a feature-rich file syncing solution for businesses of all sizes. Enterprise users especially will find a bevy of useful administrative features, including single sign-on access, file and folder tagging, hybrid cloud solutions, and 24/7 support.  Where Syncplicity really shines, however, is in security. The architecture is built with zero-knowledge policies in mind, so Syncplicity never sees or has access to customer encryption keys.  The software also supports group and user-based permissions, choice of server location (US or EU), and remote device wiping. Syncplicity meets FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program) standards out of the box, and has more than a few US government clients.  Now, you can co-edit documents in real-time, directly within Syncplicity, without needing to download files or use third-party applications.  Another significant recent update is the improvement in mobile app functionality. Syncplicity's mobile app now offers offline access to files and the ability to mark files for offline viewing, which is great if you often find yourself needing to access important documents on the go without a reliable internet connection. For IT administrators, Syncplicity has introduced advanced analytics and reporting tools. These tools provide deeper insights into how data is being used within your organization, helping you to monitor and optimize data flow, spot potential security risks, and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.  Pricing starts at $20 per month for businesses, although the best and most secure features are only available to Enterprise users, who should contact Syncplicity for a quote.  Our expert review: Resilio has a unique approach to file syncing, using peer-to-peer technology to instantly and directly share files between devices or users, without storing them on cloud servers. The company has its roots in BitTorrent and thus has secure and lightning-fast P2P built right in.  Because of this, it’s one of the fastest file-syncing solutions out there, and companies like Mercedes-Benz and VoiceBase have all praised its speed and reliability. Businesses that use and share large files will find it to be a big time-saver. It’s also highly secure, as transfers are encrypted and cannot be ready by third parties, including Resilio.  All this would be enough to make Resilio Sync a great product, but it’s also rich in business features: two-factor authentication, bidirectional real-time file and folder sync, one-time file sending, and more. Resilio works on Windows, Linux, macOS, NAS devices, iOS, and Android. If you're concerned about internet bandwidth consumption, Resilio has introduced bandwidth throttling controls. You can set limits on how much bandwidth Resilio Sync uses, ensuring that your file syncing activities don't interfere with other critical online operations. This is especially useful for businesses with limited internet resources or those operating in bandwidth-constrained environments. We're also impressed at the recent improvement to Resilio's forums and support. Over the past year, Resilio has invested in enhancing its customer support and community forums. New resources, including detailed guides, tutorials, and an active user community, are now available, making it easier to get up and running with Resilio or troubleshoot any issues that arise. Pricing starts as low as $7 per user a month, although businesses looking to back up a server will need to opt for the Medium ($11 per user a month) or Large ($14 per user a month) plans.  Our expert review: Files.com is both an API and an app, enabling your business to integrate with third-party cloud vendors, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others, via a wide variety of protocols: web, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, etc.  Accounts can be linked across services, so you can connect customers, vendors, and partners to your own accounts and to each other, with custom branding and white labeling for a seamless customer experience.  With all of this versatility, Files.com can operate as a Swiss army knife of file transferring for you, making it possible to get your files moved between all the platforms you use. For businesses that rely heavily on automation, Files.com has introduced more automation features and triggers. These can help automate routine tasks like file transfers, backups, and notifications, further enhancing efficiency and ensuring that your data management processes are as streamlined as possible. If you’re just looking for simple file syncing, Files.com is probably too complex a solution. However, it’s one of the best we’ve found for securely linking multiple cloud solutions through multiple protocols and providing seamless cloud integration between a business and its customers.   Our expert review: Citrix is a well-known name in the sphere of virtual machine and desktop as a service (DaaS), but it also has a robust cloud backup and sync solution. Whether you choose to use Citrix’s advanced virtual services or not, Citrix provides robust file syncing with business-forward features.  Citrix is built to work with a hybrid architecture, so you can store files in the cloud or on-premises, and access them with equal ease. Citrix also connects with third-party solutions like OneDrive and Google Drive to seamlessly bring together all your files, and create a single point of access for employees. Citrix will also help you better manage proprietary and regulated data, with auditing as well as activity tracking and logging. This also enables you to better protect sensitive data, and prevent users from accidentally (or intentionally) sharing a file they shouldn’t.  Citrix has introduced advanced machine learning algorithms to detect unusual behavior that could indicate a cybersecurity threat.  Citrix has also expanded its integration capabilities in the last year. While it already worked well with third-party solutions like OneDrive and Google Drive, it now includes support for additional cloud storage providers and enterprise content management systems. This means if you're using tools like Dropbox Business or Box, you can integrate them into Citrix for a more unified content collaboration environment.  For businesses heavily invested in remote work or looking to expand their remote capabilities, Citrix has enhanced its support for mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM).  While deployment can be somewhat complex, Citrix is built to work seamlessly with virtual environments, so if your business makes use of DaaS, it’s a strong contender.   Our expert review: GoodSync is a well-established file syncing solution and is trusted by companies like Adobe and Lockheed Martin. Getting started is easy, with a step-by-step process to select files and folders and set up automated backup and sync functions. After that, the software takes care of everything. GoodSync also has powerful solutions for businesses: GoodSync Workstation ($79.95 per device a year) and GoodSync Server ($499.95 per server a year), with backup and synchronization for Windows and macOS workstations, and Windows and Linux servers, respectively. GoodSync has a 30-day trial so you test whether it's a solid choice for your needs. GoodSync has expanded its cloud storage compatibility, now supporting a wider range of services directly, including Google Drive, Amazon S3, and OneDrive, among others. This makes it more versatile if you're working across multiple cloud platforms, allowing for seamless synchronization and backup across your preferred services without needing third-party integrations. Another noteworthy update is the revamp of GoodSync's user interface. Recognizing user feedback on the UI being somewhat outdated, the latest versions have introduced a more intuitive and modern design.  GoodSync has also improved its real-time synchronization capabilities. Now, changes made to files and folders are detected and synced almost instantaneously, ensuring that your files are always up-to-date across all connected devices and storage platforms. Read our GoodSync review. 
A file syncing solution is a software tool that allows users to synchronize files and data between devices, ensuring that the most updated version of a file is available on all of the user's devices. In other words, file syncing is the process of updating files across multiple devices to keep them in sync. File syncing solutions work by using a server or cloud storage to store the files, which can then be accessed and updated from any device. When a file is updated on one device, the file syncing solution automatically updates the file on all other devices that have access to the file. File syncing software offer a range of benefits, such as accessibility, collaboration, and backup. With file syncing solutions, users can access their files from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to work remotely. Collaboration is made more efficient as files can be shared and updated in real-time. Additionally, file syncing solutions can serve as a cloud backup of important files, ensuring that they are not lost if a device is lost or damaged. T can vary in terms of their features and capabilities, with some offering limited storage spac while others offer unlimited storage. Some solutions prioritize security with strong encryption methods, while others prioritize ease of use with intuitive interfaces. File syncing solutions are an essential tool for individuals and businesses alike, allowing them to keep their files organized, accessible, and up-to-date across multiple devices. To choose the best file syncing solution that meets your needs, there are several factors that you should consider. Firstly, compatibility is an essential consideration. The syncing solution you opt for should be compatible with the devices and operating systems that you use. Ensure that the solution works seamlessly with your desktop, laptop, mobile device, and any other devices that you frequently use. Secondly, storage space is a crucial factor to keep in mind. Consider the amount of storage space you require for syncing your files. Some file syncing solutions offer limited storage space, while others offer unlimited storage. Choose a solution that aligns with your storage needs. Thirdly, security should be a top priority when selecting a file syncing solution. Look for a solution that uses strong encryption methods to keep your files safe from unauthorized access. Fourthly, collaboration is another aspect to consider. If you need to collaborate with others on files, look for a file syncing solution that offers collaboration features such as commenting, version control, and real-time editing. Fifthly, ease of use is an important consideration. The file syncing solution you choose should be simple to use with an intuitive interface. Look for a platform that allows you to effortlessly upload and access your files, and has a clean and organized interface. Lastly, pricing is an essential factor to consider. File syncing solutions can be free or paid, with varying levels of features and storage. Consider your budget and storage needs to find the best pricing plan for you. By taking these factors into account and conducting thorough research, you can find a file syncing solution that suits your needs and preferences, allowing you to sync your files seamlessly and securely across all your devices. When it comes to evaluating file syncing solutions, we use a variety of methods to ensure that we thoroughly test each software's capabilities. Whenever possible, our process involves installing and testing the software on different devices, operating systems, and networks to determine its efficiency, reliability, and compatibility. We start by installing the file syncing software on different devices, including laptops, desktops, and mobile devices. We also install the software on different operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Once the software is installed, we configure it based on the recommended settings and options. This includes selecting the folders to sync, setting up automatic sync, and configuring any other necessary options. We then test the software's performance by syncing different types of files, including small and large files, text documents, images, videos, and music files. We also test how the software handles conflicts, such as file versioning and file deletions. We test the software's reliability by deliberately disconnecting devices and networks to see how the software handles syncing errors and interruptions. We also test the software's ability to recover from errors and sync changes after reconnection. We evaluate the software's security features, including encryption, password protection, and two-factor authentication. We also test how the software handles sharing files with other users and how it manages access permissions. We assess the software's user interface, ease of use, and available features. We also evaluate the software's compatibility with other software and services, such as cloud storage platforms, productivity tools, and backup solutions. Finally, we test the software's customer support options, including online help resources, user communities, and technical support. For more information, see our testing methodology page. We've put together a guide on how to share files between Android and iPhone if you just need to transfer a few files, but a more robust cloud storage solution may be the better option for better file sharing.
