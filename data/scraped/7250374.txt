“Kid? kid? kid?” one officer repeatedly said while looking for the boy. “Kid, are you in there? Please come out.”The boy is found bound in a closet and can be heard moaning as an officer picks him up and cradles him in his arms.“There’s blood all over his head. He’s cracked in the head,” an officer cries out.“Where the f— is the ambulance?” an officer screams.Jim Nicolai “Matthews” (PHOTO COURTESY OF WWJ-AM (950)“You’re OK kid,” the officer repeatedly tells the child as he carries him through the home and outside, where a township fire truck pulls up.The video was shown Thursday in Macomb County Circuit Court in Mount Clemens at the sentencing for Williamson, 55, of Pontiac, who was ordered to serve life without parole for the Sept. 23, 2022 hammer beating and throat slashing of Matthews, aka Nicolai, 57. Williamson also beat the boy with the hammer and cut the neck of the boy’s mother, Nicole Guertin, 35, and imprisoned both of them along with Guertin’s 5-year-old daughter by binding them.

Williamson was a “drug friend” and lover of Guertin, who invited him to the home at about 4 a.m. and was attacked along with her children when she asked him to leave, according to her prior testimony. Williamson had brought drugs to the home in celebration of his birthday, she said.Matthews worked as an overnight broadcaster on WWJ-AM (950) radio station.The showing of the nearly 4-minute video was proposed by Assistant Macomb Prosecutor Steve Fox, who conceded his request was “unusual.” It was opposed by Williamson’s attorney, Joan Morgan.“I don’t pretend to not feel spite, I’ll be frank,” Fox told Judge James Biernat Jr. before he granted the request. “They (Matthews family members) have to live with this and suffer for the rest of their lives. I want to ensure he (Williamson) sees some of the images. I hope he feels some of these images and hears these sounds for the rest of his life.”The boy’s statement to Williamson was read in the Macomb Circuit Court courtroom by Assistant Macomb Prosecutor Stephanie Stager.“I hate you. I hate you for what you did to me and my family,” said the boy, now 11. “You ruined my life. You ruined all of our lives. And now my dad is gone, and we have to live with what you did. You put me and my mom and my sister through hours of hell. What you did to my dad is horrible. I had to see him like that, and that is something a kid should never have to go through, not to mention the pain and torture you put me through. You are evil. You left me with trauma. We didn’t deserve what you did. I’ll never understand why you had to hurt us all, but I’m so glad you’re going away forever. You deserve to be alone.”Joe and Jennifer Nicolai talk to reporters Thursday following the sentencing of Arthur Williamson, who killed Joe Nicolai’s brother, Jim Matthews, and injured Matthews’ longtime live-in girlfriend and their son.JAMESON COOK — THE MACOMB DAILYThe boy had to undergo surgery to his ear and lost some cognitive ability from the attack for which he is undergoing therapy, according to his uncle, Joe Nicolai.Ashley Quigley, the maternal aunt of the children and current guardian of the two children, said they will overcome the effects of the horrific incident.“I want you to know that what you did will not define the lives you affected,” she said. “The wounds you left us will stay with us forever but they will heal. …. We will not continue to let your vile actions suffocate us, and I will ensure that these two kids grow up knowing nothing but love and support so that they can live their life in spite of you.”Williamson, in his statement, only told the judge, “I am sorry. I’m sorry.” Morgan said Williamson is remorseful, noting his agreement to plead avoided a painful trial for the victims.But Joe Nicolai and his wife, Jennifer Nicolai, said afterward they do not believe Williamson is remorseful and cannot forgive him.“It’s unforgivable what he did,” Joe Nicolai said. “How can you forgive something that’s intentional?”Joe Nicolai didn’t speak during the hearing but afterward said he wanted to attack Williamson while standing near him as his wife gave her statement.“I wanted to get up, I wanted to jump up but those officers were looking at me,” Nicolai said. “I wanted to get one or two kicks or swings in on that man, but it’s just wasted effort.”Joe Nicolai described entering his brother’s house, located across the street from his residence, shortly after the incident and finding pieces of his brother’s skull on the floor. He said while that was difficult and angered him, he said the children suffered far more than he did.“The kids, they lost both of their parents, they had to witness that and had to go through that,” he said.Nicole Guertin testifies in 42-II District Court in New Baltimore at the preliminary examination for Arthur Williamson for the murder of Jim Matthews and the attempted murder of Guertin and one of two of the couple’s children.MACOMB DAILY FILE PHOTOGuertin spoke over Zoom video. At times weeping, Guertin called Matthews “the rock of our whole family” and an attentive father. The couple had been together for 20 years and had the two children.“The world lost an excellent man, an excellent father, and with that the world has lost its sunshine and love,” she said. “It does not still feel real. Everything has changed for the worse.”After she finished, Biernat questioned Guertin about her choice to allow Williamson into the family’s home at that time of night: “Would you agree with me that inviting this person, (with) multiple prior felonies, prison, an evil man, to your house at 4 o’clock in the morning with your children there and your significant other at work coming home soon, was to say the least an epic, and epically disastrous decision to do. Would i be correct in saying that?”“Absolutely,” she replied.Biernat stopped questioning her further on protest from Fox.Williamson was on parole at the time for criminal convictions in Oakland and Clinton counties. He also has prior convictions for attempted murder, kidnapping and two gun charges for a 2002 incident in St. Clair County for which he served nine years in prison, and two counts of delivery of less than 50 grams of narcotics in 1994 in Macomb County, according to records.Biernat told Williamson that it is “good you would never see the light of day out of prison.”Macomb Circuit Judge James Biernat interacts with Nicole Guertin on Thursday at the sentencing for Arthur Williamson, who killed Jim Matthews and tried to kill her and their 10-year-old son.MACOMB DAILY PHOTO“In your statement, you said you were ‘sorry,’ that ‘it was a really bad night’,” Biernat said. “You said in your statement that you didn’t want to go out as a pedophile. Well sir, you’re a pedophile, you’re a murderer, and you’re really the embodiment of evil. It’s good you’ll never see the light of day out of prison. You can’t be among people.”Biernat was referring to Williamson’s agreement to plead no contest to all of the charges last April in exchange for prosecutors not adding a rape charge for his attempted penetration of the 5-year-old girl during the more than one-hour incident. Williamson did not want the molestation conviction on his record before going to prison.Biernat also referenced Williamson’s suicide attempt after killing Matthews and injuring and imprisoning the others.“Try committing suicide before you do any of this, take yourself out so you don’t kill people and don’t try to rape 5-year-olds,” Biernat said.Williamson was ordered to pay $8,500 in restitution for funeral, clean-up and probate costs.Macomb County sheriff commends the actions of 3 ‘remarkable’ deputies in separate incidentsTrial date set for Warren dog attack caseWarren real estate agent who conspired to sexually exploit children receives 20-year prison termClinton Twp. woman charged with manslaughter for allowing son to freeze to death Officers are seen and heard in the video played in the courtroom locating murder victim Jim Matthews and his killer, Arthur Williamson, then turn their attention to the boy who was in a closet in the home in Hidden Harbor condominiums off Jefferson Avenue. “Kid? kid? kid?” one officer repeatedly said while looking for the boy. “Kid, are you in there?
