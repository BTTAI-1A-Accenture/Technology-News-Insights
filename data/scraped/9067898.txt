In response to this, the game's director Morio Kishimoto has once again thanked fans and all the staff that worked on the game for their support. He went on to mention how it's inspired the team to create an even "greater" experience next time. "We made it into the top 5 of TGA Players' Voice! This is all thanks to your support! The third generation is off to a good start. I'm happy! I am sure that this result will be a big driving force for the next work. We promise you an experience of greater excitement and surprise. Finally, I would like to thank all the staff involved in this project." It's not the first time Morio Kishimoto has said something like this. Following the release of Frontiers, he mentioned how the team wanted to take the Sonic series to "greater heights": "I got a lot of energy from everyone's comments! I am very honored that so many people enjoyed it! After more than 10 years of trial and error, I was finally able to create this work. Open Zone is full of possibilities. Sonic games become more interesting. We will continue to challenge ourselves to greater heights." In terms of what to expect in the near future, Sega recently revealed a free DLC Road Map for Sonic Frontiers (releasing throughout 2023). It will include a new story, playable characters and even a free Holiday themed suit, which you can grab later this month.  Update: Free 'holiday cheer suit' launches today Are you excited about Sonic's future? Comment below.

Comments 50  Please, please, please, dont pull another generations, you have such a great thing going, just improve on it, and while this hearing them say this makes me happy, There going to have to pull it off one more time to earn my trust.  Did someone say make Sonic Colors 2?!  @Snatcher Exactly, but hey, at least they pulled this one off well-enough despite scepticism so at least we can hope a little for once : P  @Takoda oh yeah definitely! I love that game!  Third generation? So, 2D Classic Games, and every 3D game from Adventure to Forces is the 2nd Generation of Sonic games? I feel like the third generation of Sonic was the Boost Era, Unleashed, Colors, Generations, and Forces.  @Takoda Given NintendoLife review 4/10 and metacritic around 70% for both Switch and PS5, the skepticism didn't totally go away even after release. I'm curious if they will react to only the positive feedback for the next game or if they will attempt to react to both the positive and negative, part of which would be difficult when different people loved and hated the exact same features üòÜ. I feel like it's a roll of the dice how good the next game is either way.  @Nua The gameplay shift for the boost games was big, but frontiers is the biggest shift in the paradigm since adventure 1 imo so i think they're justified  @FishyS Well, they are sadly well known ror trying to please everybody and in the end pleasing nobody, but as someone who had the time of his life playing Sonic Frontiers and them seemingly finally sticking to their guns, to a formula that they can polish up and develop further instead of changing it up for no reason all the time, colour me a lil more hopeful than usual with the blue blur.  @Nua Or the third 3D generation, maybe? (Less likely that this is what he meant, but at least it makes more sense.) Kind of an odd way to describe it in any case.  Sega lives in their own fantasy land.  General impressions I've gotten is that there's a pretty fun core in there with... some roughness around the edges, so I'm happy it sounds like they're planning to stick to that formula for a bit and make it better now that they've got a base to work from. Hope Pok√©mon can do the same thing instead of randomly taking some steps back because they had to start working on the next one before they could take any lessons from the last one :/  I had a really, really good time with Frontiers on butter smooth PS5 and I‚Äôm hopeful for the future of Sonic again. Some things they could improve upon:  Being this far removed from Frontiers' release, I can say that I walked away from the experience feeling way better about the future of Sonic than I did before I booted Frontiers up. It may be rougher around the edges compared to games like Lost World and Forces, but it's probably the most sincere fun I've had in a 3D Sonic game since Unleashed (and Generations). I feel like Sonic is at his best when the franchise is taken a bit more seriously than just meme and nostalgia fodder. And so long as the same passionate people keep leading the charge [and Sega gives them a proper development schedule], I have no doubt Sonic will return to being a force to be reckoned with when the next mainline title rolls around.  Well... We'll see, eh?  I look forward to it. The game was really good. Hopefully Nintendo Life don't leave a troll review next time.  Can they make a game without a bazillion bugs first please and also without looking like trash with as they said ‚Äúyears of experience‚Äù it should be possible right?  I'm playing it on Series X and I love it, feels like playing Sonic Adventure back in the day. Best 3D Sonic game in many years. My one criticism is STOP SHOEHORNING IN MEDIOCRE 2D STAGES WITH WEIRD PHYSICS. I daresay these ones control even worse than Classic Sonic stages on Forces. Do they need lessons from Christian Whitehead?  @BrintaPap The truth is the game is too ambitious for Switch and developing for it simultaneously with the other releases probably held back the other versions, hence even Series X and PS5 having the same pop-in seen on the Switch version. I really hope Nintendo is ready to move on to their next console soon. Even their own games are struggling now (see new Pokemon)  Not a patch on Sonic Unleashed.  Please make it cheerful and colourful.  This game is on my forever increasing list of games I want to play one day. Hopefully it shows up on Game Pass next year.  Imho, get rid of the standard unreal engine world, and replace it with something more stylized and fun.. ditto to music.. and I‚Äôll buy  @Clyde_Radcliffe yeah I know, I did not even meant the switch specifically but I mean all platforms in general. I also think that GF needs more people and/or take a longer time, just like Team Sonic, to develop their games (and specifically for the switch).  Shouldn't be hard to top it though üòÇüòÅ  Ask the zelda team to help  The introduction to third generation of Sonic is... Bitesize boost gameplay sections in the middle of an empty field, and awful boost levels that mostly recycle visuals and layouts from various games between 2001 and 2011? And they added some combat which is just okay at best, but the game would definitely be better without it. Yeah... Not a great start. I don't hate Frontiers, far from it. It's the best 3D Sonic game in years. And I actually enjoy it, warts and all. But seeing SEGA tout it as something revolutionary rubs me the wrong way because once you get past some of superficial aspects, it's so very, very similar to what came before. Did they really spend so long working on just re-arranging their formula for the boost games? Considering how flawed the foundation of Frontiers is (subjective) and how much it got wrong (also subjective), I'm filled with more trepidation and dread for the next game than I am hope. I think they're heading in the wrong direction. So from the charts and the fact that they announced all that free DLC, it's probably safe to say that Frontiers has sold well. And it's certainly pleased some fans and critics. Fair play to everyone who is satisfied with Frontiers. However, it's definitely not a home run when the average Metascore is around 70% by platform, and the SD of scores is so high. It tells you that people are mixed on the game and that there's no consensus that it's particularly good or bad. It's a game that players can't come to one conclusion about.  Islands are nice and big. Cyberspace levels play weird and are repetitive. Way too much pop in. I like how some springs are like side quests. You hit one and you never know where Sonic will end up.  Yup! That's what he said!  Who is more tone deaf, Game Freak or SEGA?  Can someone explain when the first and second generations are defined as? Anyway, just take your time with the next one. No need to rush it to meet that "once a year Sonic release" deadline you seem to set yourself.  @Clyde_Radcliffe Sonic Team and Game Freak are the quintessential lazy game devs that just rely on brand loyalty. It pays off, so why change? Anyway, I would not use them as any kind of example of the Switch's inadequacy. Breath of the Wild happened in 2017, and is leaps and bounds ahead of this dumpster fire.  @Baker1000 From what people like Iizuka (head of Sonic Team) and Kishimoto (director of every 3D Sonic game from Sonic Team since Secret Rings, except Unleashed and Generations) have said before, the games would be divided up as such: 1st generation = 1991 to 1997 (S1 to SK for main games), 2nd generation = 1998 to 2021 (Adventure to Forces for main games) and 3rd generation from Frontiers/2022 onwards. Lots of fans would disagree with that, myself included. I'd say that the second generation was from Adventure to 06, and the 3rd generation started with Unleashed and continues to this day. I can see the argument for Frontiers being a new generation, but it really does not feel that way to me. But most importantly, I don't think that you can put the early 3D games in the same category as the boost ones. They're incredibly different.  @LikelySatan ‚ÄúSonic Team and Game Freak are the quintessential lazy game devs that just rely on brand loyalty. It pays off, so why change?‚Äù To be fair, both of these developers‚Äô most recent games have been genuine attempts by to reinvent their respective series, and as proofs of concept, they hold genuine promise. The issue is less that the devs are lazily resting in their laurels (which would have been a fair critique of many previous titles) and more that the results are‚Ä¶ well, ‚Äòextremely unpolished‚Äô (to be charitable) or ‚Äòa laughably buggy, broken mess‚Äô (to be blunt). The reasons for this are likely less to do with apathetic devs and more to do with unrealistic deadlines imposed by managers far removed from the development process, as well as potentially inadequacies/inefficiencies in the structure and size of the team. To blame everything on a bunch of programmers being ‚Äòlazy‚Äô is itself a rather lazy conception, and to imply ‚Äòthings haven‚Äôt changed‚Äô feels off too. Things have changed, but instead of the ugly duckling turning into beautiful swan, it‚Äôs turned into an even uglier dragon, which is like‚Ä¶ cool, because it‚Äôs now a dragon, but it would still be nice if it wasn‚Äôt so god damn ugly.  @Maxz I'm just not excusing it anymore. You say Frontiers and Current Pokemon Game are decent bases to build off, but neither Sonic Team nor Game Freak are going to do that, if precedent is anything to go by. Sonic Team have reinvented the wheel a million times, and it's always awful to just below middling. Game Freak have not been developing for handhelds exclusively anymore for years. It shouldn't be our problem if they don't have the staff to develop big boy games. They need more people or they need to roll back the scope of their games. They took out a bunch of great features that were in Arceus. That's just sloppy and embarrassing. They straight up lied about using animation from the 3DS games and why they had to cut down the Pokedex. I don't care if you think it is lazy to say it...Game Freak are lazy developers, they lie when they are called out on it, and their fans defend them no matter what. Either way, the point is I know better than to buy their games at release. And I know better than to take the word of any fan of Pokemon or Sonic.  @Paraka I can see Iizuka exerting some ‚Äúcreative‚Äù control to stop them from making a iterative sequel and instead go in a wacky new direction that retains a small bit of this game‚Äôs DNA, they absolutely need to do a iterative sequel that irons out issues and and has more of a focus on making the exploration in open zone meaningful so no more being wishy washy about not having a collectible you have to find and earn instead of just having it randomly given out, look at the purple fishing coins you‚Äôll immediately think of Odyssey‚Äôs purple regional coins but they aren‚Äôt equivalent when you get the annoying night slot machine event where the game dumps a seemingly infinite amount of them on the player effortlessly and then you visit the fishing pond where you can further make collecting anything else irrelevant.  I still can't decide on getting this one or not....I still rate SA/SA2B as some of my favourite games of all time, but no Sonic game has really matched that for me in terms of enjoyment or investment since then. One thing that really does not hook me about this, aside what appears to be an almost DK64 like amount of collecting, is the de-saturation. I'm sorry...but..something about the lack of colour it has...doesn't feel right. I am also a bit wary of how it is being touted as "excellent frame work...to build on for next time!". Even by the developers! What about this time? Should I just wait to see what next time is?  Seriously, can't Sega get ANYTHING besides Sonic on their brains anymore? I guess that "survey" they sent out early this year about what other "legacy IPs" we wanted to see was all just another farse, wasn't it? Sega used to be arguably the most prolific and genre-diverse publisher in the entire industry, including their dominance of the Arcades. Now they're a has-been that hasn't been what they used to be for so long that most readers here (you don't even have to be that young anymore) probably always will only ever associate their brand with Sonic, and that's a travesty.  Love this game, can't wait for more. I don't understand the Sega hate here.  @SalvorHardin I still think you‚Äôre confusing ‚Äòtime constrained‚Äô and potentially even ‚Äòtechnically incompetent‚Äô and ‚Äòpoorly organised‚Äô with ‚Äòlazy‚Äô. The outcome is the same: broken, buggy games. It‚Äôs not excusable, and I am by no means excusing it. And I don‚Äôt want you to buy the games. Please don‚Äôt buy the games. Please. But nothing is helped by misattributing the underlying cause. Perhaps it takes less mental effort to criticise the developers using a simple Calvinist moral argument (game is broken = devs fail to understand the virtue of labour), but that cuts out wider corporate structure and upper management entirely, which are the levels at which these crucial decisions are likely being made. It‚Äôs quite simply lazy to ignore them. ‚Ä¶Anyway, I expect an in-depth, fully proofread 10,000 word response outlining the reasons why you think that upper management aren‚Äôt in any way responsible for the poor performance of these games, and I‚Äôd like it within the next five minutes. If you can‚Äôt produce it, I can only conclude that you too have fallen ill to the modern affliction of ‚Äòlaziness‚Äô.  @Maxz Dude, we get it.
Your uncle works at Game Freak. You don't know what caused this whole mess. It would be really neat if you could stop condescending here.
...oh, condescending is when you talk down to someone.  @Mana_Knight Nah, it's nothing like DK64 in terms of things to collect. It IS definitely a collect-a-thon, but not an absurd one. 1) Memory tokens progress the story, and can be found still over the map in abundance. You barely have to look for them. They're everywhere.2) Field bosses drop gears, which unlock cyberspace levels (heavily encouraged, but technically not mandatory). 3) Cyberspace levels reward you with keys. Keys unlock the Emeralds.4) Collect all Emeralds to progress to the main boss.5) All collectables are available in infinite quantities. You can also get them as rewards for minigames. The loop of the game is explore maps > fight field bosses > beat cyberspace (traditional levels) > repeat until all Emeralds have been collected. Despite my criticisms of the game and the abundance of things to collect, I'll say this: Frontiers does a very good job of creating a rewarding, engaging and balanced gameplay loop. It doesn't have you running around on a treasure hunt. You're free to just experience the game in any order that you wish and it progresses naturally. Although me and others I spoke to found it got a bit long in the tooth towards the end, and we all resorted to using the minigame to get keys for the Emeralds.  @BlueBCA Thank you for explaining further! That is good to know that you can earn it in the mini games if needs be. I get a bit put off by big games which put percent completions on collecting so many things, as I am very OCD there, and feel I would HAVE to try and get 100 percent, and worry about being overwhelmed.  @Mana_Knight The only thing that Frontiers counts for 100% is the map. It's easy going.  This would imply that the second generation of Sonic lasted from 1998 to 2022, or 74% of Sonic‚Äôs entire lifetime.  @RainbowGazelle this  @Paraka Just play Lost World  @BlueBCA Ah, even better!   I can't wait for another mediocre adventure! It's sad people are praising Frontiers as Sonic's Odyssey. The bar has really been set so low it might as well be underground.  @BlueBCA Thanks for your help. Asked for it for Christmas now. Fingers crossed it will join Sonic Adventure 1+2 as super sonic special games for me!  @BlueBCA yeah I'd agree with that, that time span of 23 years is way too big to lump all the games together. The Dreamcast-PS2 era should be separate. I'd say Wii up until Forces, then this game is a new era completely.  Show Comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...
