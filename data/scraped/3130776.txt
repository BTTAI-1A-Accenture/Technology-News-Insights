With a win over the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night, the Philadelphia 76ers collected their 50th of the season. It marked the fourth time in the last six seasons the Sixers cracked 50 wins. Before the Sixers achieved a record of 52-30 in 2017-2018, it took them 16 years to finally pick up 50 wins in a single season. The last time they did it at that point was the 2000-2001 team that made a run for the NBA title before getting stopped short by the Los Angeles Lakers. When the Sixers picked up win No. 50 on Wednesday, it was the fastest way to 50 for the team since the 2000-2001 team. Although the Allen Iverson-led squad achieved 50 wins in 72 games that year compared to the 76 games it took for this year’s team, the Sixers of today have a chance to tie the older team’s regular season record. After the 2000-2001 team picked up their 50th win on March 30, 2001, they finished off the year by going 6-4. In the end, they wrapped up the season with 56 wins and 26 losses. As of Thursday, the Sixers hold a a 50-26 record. With six games left, the 76ers would have to win out to tie the record. According to Tankathon, the Sixers have the second-toughest schedule for their remaining six games, sitting behind only the New Orleans Pelicans. The chances of the Sixers winning out and tying the record is slim, but how do the two teams compare in some notable categories as the 2022-2023 playoffs approach? The early 2001 Eastern Conference Champions finished the year averaging 94.7 points per game, which ranked 15th in the league. They gave up 90.4 points per game, which allowed them to just crack the top five. Offensively, they rated 13th in the league and were rated fifth defensively. Their +4.7 net rating was their fourth-best. As for this year’s Sixers, they are putting up 115.2 points per game, which is 14th in the league. On defense, they’ve allowed 110.5 points per game, which is currently the third-best. Philly’s current offensive rating is fourth in the league, while their defensive rating is the seventh-best in the league. When it comes to net rating, it’s the same as the team that competed for a title at +4.7, which ranks them third at the moment. The Sixers will continue their schedule on Friday night with a matchup against the Toronto Raptors. And in the coming weeks, we’ll see if the Sixers can make a run similar to the 2000-2001 squad.  Justin Grasso covers the Philadelphia 76ers for All76ers, a Sports Illustrated channel.
