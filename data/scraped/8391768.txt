In 2022 cyber-attacks on healthcare services resulted in
providers struggling to operate without access to their
information technology systems and private patient
information being leaked onto the dark web.Palo Alto
Networks, a leading provider of cybersecurity services,
commissioned research which shows that Kiwis think it’s a
matter of when, not if, another cyber-attack hits the health
sector, and say they expect providers to pay a price if they
fail to stop them – particularly as more lifesaving
personal medical devices are connected to the Internet,
making them a rich target for cyber criminals.Alex
Nehmy, Director, Industry 4.0 Strategy – Asia Pacific and
Japan at Palo Alto Networks says:“Technology
continues to drive rapid improvements in healthcare to
deliver better health outcomes for Kiwis. At the same time,
cyber threats and the sophistication of cyber-attacks
continue to increase dramatically.“56% of Kiwis
surveyed said they are worried a similar attack to the one
that breached the Pinnacle Midlands Health Network in
September 2022. Sectors like healthcare will continue to be
attractive targets to cyber criminals because they can
quickly sell patient data on the dark web, while
ransomware’s ability to lock down patient care and
back-office systems make lucrative ransom payments
likely.”The research, commissioned by Palo Alto
Networks and conducted by Talbot Mills Research in November
2022, found that 50% of Kiwis are more concerned about
cybersecurity now that there is a centralised healthcare
system through Te Whatu Ora which replaces individual
District Health Boards.



“As New Zealand’s health
infrastructure undergoes a once in a generation
transformation, cyber security has never been so critical in
safeguarding health systems, information, and the privacy
and safety of patients."63% of those surveyed said
they would support policy that would fine companies that
lose customers’ data due to weak cybersecurity policies
and procedures, and 45% would support policy that would make
it illegal for organisations to pay cyber ransoms. Of those
surveyed, only 26% feel the government is investing enough
in cybersecurity.The rise of medical Internet of
Things (IoT)Digitisation is enabling brand new
capabilities for healthcare such as virtual healthcare and
remote diagnosis, but the prevalence of legacy systems is
making healthcare providers and sensitive data a soft
target, and cyber criminals will be increasingly focussing
on it.Nehmy says that, “As more Kiwis start using
Internet connected personal medical devices, such as heart
rate monitors for example, cyber criminals will look to
exploit any security vulnerabilities – and clearly that
may have serious consequences for users.“Our
research shows that 44% of Kiwis are concerned about
personal data collected from at-home medical devices being
stolen and leaked online, and 47% say they would be more
willing to use at-home devices if the security of their data
was guaranteed.“Similar to workplace safety,
cybersecurity must be a primary concern for boards,
executive teams, and business leaders. Organisations that
prioritise cybersecurity understand that it is a business
issue and not simply an information technology issue, and
that stopping cyber-attacks before they occur must be a
fundamental part of their business
operations.”About Palo Alto NetworksPalo

 Although we have not yet reached the spring selling season, we are observing early signs of growth in the market not typically associated with this time of year. This can be seen through the seasonally adjusted data, which indicates an increase of 5.4% in national sales compared to last year, which reflects a market performing above anticipated levels. Whilst the decision served as a warning to supermarkets not to take part in anticompetitive conduct, the penalty hardly reflected the impact of a lack of competition for consumers. It was just a fraction of the $7.3 billion that could have been handed down under the legislation. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is expanding a scholarship programme for tertiary students as part of its efforts to boost on-the-ground support for farmers and growers. A model designed to give an early warning of a downturn in the economy is suggesting continued weakening in the labour market with an unemployment rate that may have already reached 4.8 per cent. In New Zealand while RTD sales volumes continued to trend down, total spirit and spirit-based drink volumes passed that of wine in 2023. 50% of spirits sold globally in 2022 were at premium level or above, reflecting consumers’ growing preference to drink less and drink better. In June 2024, training organisation Competenz experienced a cyber-attack, resulting in unauthorised access to its IT system and data theft. Affected individuals have the right to make a complaint to us or the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
