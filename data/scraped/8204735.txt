Business architecture is the discipline of designing, planning and aligning the capabilities, processes, information and resources of an organization to achieve its strategic goals and deliver value to its stakeholders. However, creating and maintaining a coherent and effective business architecture is not a one-time exercise, but a continuous process that requires constant monitoring, evaluation and improvement. To do this, you need to use appropriate metrics that can help you identify the gaps, risks and opportunities in your business architecture and guide your decision-making and actions. In this article, we will discuss what are the best metrics to use and how to apply them in your business architecture practice.
 
Metrics are quantitative or qualitative measures that can indicate the performance, progress, or outcome of a specific aspect of your business architecture. Utilizing metrics can help you assess the current state and maturity of your architecture, identify gaps between your desired and actual state, evaluate the impact of initiatives and projects, monitor and control solutions execution and delivery, and communicate the value of your architecture to stakeholders. Furthermore, metrics can assist in demonstrating the benefits of your business architecture in order to gain support and feedback from sponsors.
 
Depending on your purpose, scope and audience, there are various metrics you can use to measure different aspects of your business architecture. Capability metrics, for example, measure the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of your business capabilities - the abilities that your organization needs to execute its strategy and deliver value. This could include customer satisfaction, revenue, cost, quality, productivity, and innovation. Process metrics measure the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of your business processes - the sequences of activities that produce a specific output or outcome. This could include cycle time, throughput, error rate, and waste. Information metrics measure the quality, availability and usability of your business information - the data and knowledge that support your business capabilities and processes. This could include accuracy, completeness, timeliness, relevance, and security. Finally, resource metrics measure the utilization, capacity and optimization of your business resources - the assets and enablers that support your business capabilities and processes. This could include budget, staff skills, technology infrastructure etc.
 
When selecting and defining metrics for your business architecture, it is important to ensure they are aligned with your strategy, vision, goals and objectives, and reflect the desired outcomes. The metrics should also be relevant to the context, scope and audience, address key issues, and be measurable with data and evidence. Furthermore, the metrics should be actionable to enable informed decisions and appropriate actions for improvement. Lastly, the metrics should provide timely feedback to monitor and control your business architecture.
 
Using metrics effectively in your business architecture practice requires a systematic and iterative approach. Start by defining your metrics based on purpose, scope, and audience. Use clear and consistent terminology and format, as well as document their definitions, sources, methods, and targets. Collect data from various sources like surveys or documents, and use reliable methods to ensure quality. Analyze the data with appropriate tools and identify patterns or trends. When reporting the findings, use concise language and visuals that convey the meaning of your metrics. Highlight any gaps or risks that you identified and provide recommendations to address them. Lastly, review your metrics regularly to evaluate their effectiveness and relevance for your business architecture.
