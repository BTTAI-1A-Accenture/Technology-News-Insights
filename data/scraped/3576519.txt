Epiroc DTH drill bits have an all-new face design.  This  means optimized flushing and handling of drill cuttings, and the bits have more  buttons, which increase the overall energy when drilling. There are three  different shapes to choose from to tackle different drilling needs and types of  rock: Epiroc Trubbnos, spherical, and ballistic buttons. Epiroc DTH drill bits  are produced with improved heat treatment and increased face hardness, the company  says, for a robust bit with increased service life.
