India’s telescope game can get even better Einstein theorised the existence of gravitational waves in 1916 but it was only in 2015 that America’s LIGO detectors could observe and confirm these. This week an international consortium has reported a bewitching ‘hum’ that is the sound of gravitational waves reverberating across the universe. What actually are gravitational waves? A ripple in the fabric of space and time. It sounds like science fiction and the only reason we know it’s actually fact is 100 years of scientific persistence, combined with a lot of governmental funding and international collaboration. What we now have is a completely new way of knowing the universe. Where we had only eyes, we now have ears too. Scientists from seven Indian institutes along with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune played key roles in uncovering the new and first evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves permeating the cosmos. Earlier this year GOI also gave the final approvals to LIGO-India, for which land has been acquired in Maharashtra. Given that the project’s in-principle approval had come in 2016, it should see better progress at least from here on. This is a long game, it needs strong, sustained support for science and exploration. We look up to space not only because we wonder where we came from, how we got here, and many other very human existential questions, but also for the equally human drive to identify where we can go next.
