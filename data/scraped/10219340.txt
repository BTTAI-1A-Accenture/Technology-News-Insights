Are you really making the most out of your Amazon Prime subscription? Sure, you’ve got paper towels and cat litter coming in like clockwork. But if you’re not regularly combing through the service’s streaming catalog, then you’re missing out on hundreds of hours of killer TV. Since getting into the original-content game, Prime Video has churned out some great series—award-winners such as Fleabag and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, recent faves like The Boys and The Lord Of The Rings: The Rings Of Power (which returns with its second season on August 29), and lesser-known left-turns including Patriot. And that’s not counting all of the fine shows that debuted elsewhere, like the beloved comedy Catastrophe. This list is in alphabetical order. It was last updated on August 2, 2024. It will update monthly.  Stars: Karl Urban, Antony Starr, Jack Quaid, Erin Moriarty, Dominique McElligott, Laz Alonso, Tomer Capone, Karen Fukuhara, Jessie T. Usher, Chace Crawford, Elisabeth Shue, Colby Minifie, Aya Cash, Claudia Doumit Number of seasons included with subscription: 4 Let’s be honest: If superpowers were real, then American capitalism would turn the people who have them into egomaniacal celebrities with god complexes faster than you can say, “So…is the city paying for that?” Based on Garth Ennis’ comics of the same, this show imagines a group of vigilantes intent on exposing so-called superheroes in a world where corporate overlords control them. It’s like Watchmen, only way more fun and, frankly, disgusting. Season four of the series wrapped up in July.
