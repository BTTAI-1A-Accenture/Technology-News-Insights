Director of global outreach & partnerships, IC3 Movement                         There has been a significant rise in the number of Indian students choosing to pursue higher education overseas. Recent data presented in Parliament by the government revealed a 68% rise in Indian students studying abroad over the past year, with 7,50,365 students going abroad in 2022 as opposed to 4,44,553 in 2021. This number is projected to double by 2024, reaching almost 1.8 million students. Numerous Indian students aspire to attend a foreign university each year, however, some of these applicants are turned down during the admissions process or following the visa interview. Also, many students leave a foreign country after starting a course because they can’t finish it or regret enrolling in a specific course at a particular institution. This occurs mainly because students, and their family members, frequently make mistakes that they are unaware of, which can later result in significant financial loss and stress. Here are the three typical mistakes candidates make and how to prevent them. 1. Submitting the application with only 90% of the documents ready Incomplete applications account for almost 70% of Indian students being rejected from foreign colleges and visa offices. Students believe they can submit their application if they meet nine of the 10 requirements, but that is untrue. When mailing an admissions application, students must include all the supporting documentation indicated on the university website. Students should consider every document as necessary, regardless of how minor it might seem, and double-check the list against the university website and other authorized sources. Even one missing document could result in a rejection. 2. Focus on your individual choices Looking beyond the brand and the who-went-where aspects are pertinent while selecting a college. Students should look for a college that is a good fit. Projected costs, curriculum, instruction rigor, the institution’s focus areas, and, yes, even the weather are all aspects students should consider. If the college is the right fit, chances are that the student may be the right fit for them too. 3. Essays are crucial Every day, an admissions officer reads dozens of essays. Applications must be captivating, genuine, and imaginative, and show thorough understanding of the selected college(s) to stand out. When writing supplemental essays, feeling at home at school is equally crucial. Students must put in the effort and seek wise counsel, whether starting with the personal statement for UCAS or perfecting the first draft for the Common App. Draft, rewrite, get comments, and iterate until satisfied. A common misconception among students is that they can obtain all the information online. Looking for career counselors who can assist during the application process, however, is advisable. Due to a delayed response, bad connectivity, or inaccurate or out-of-date information, students can encounter ambiguity and miss deadlines. By working with a knowledgeable ‘study abroad’ adviser, students can be sure that everything is done correctly and that all deadlines can be met.    Views expressed above are the author's own.
