The human body can be likened to a well-oiled machine, running smoothly when all its parts are functioning properly. However, what happens when one of those parts becomes defective along the way? It either needs repair through medication or replacement altogether. Unfortunately, the cost of procedures like liver transplants in India is exceptionally high, making it seemingly unattainable for a large majority of the population in India. The liver, a vital organ, plays a crucial role in the body. It aids in the detoxification of various substances, produces essential digestive biochemicals, and synthesizes proteins. Additionally, the liver carries out functions such as breaking down red blood cells, producing hormones, and regulating glycogen storage. When the liver fails, patients may require temporary solutions like dialysis. Although scientists are researching artificial livers that can function similarly to natural ones, liver transplantation remains the only permanent and long-term solution for liver failure. A liver transplant is usually needed after the liver is damaged so severely that it cannot perform normal functions. This is typically referred to as liver failure or end-stage liver disease. Some of the most prominent causes of liver disease are Alcohol-related liver disease is caused when the liver is scarred due to prolonged alcohol misuse. Hepatitis, a blood-borne virus, is another major cause of liver failure. Cases of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C usually cause the most extensive damage to the liver. Primary Biliary Cholangitis, also known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is another often misunderstood condition which can lead to progressive liver damage. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a condition that can cause long-lasting inflammation in the liver. On average, the cost of a liver transplant in India can be anywhere between INR 10 to 30 lakhs. While it is a reasonably large amount, it is fairly lower than the cost of the same procedure in other developed countries. However, since this is an average number, the actual cost of the operation can vary depending on many factors. There are three main types of liver transplant, including, Orthotopic or deceased organ donation, in which the liver has been removed from an individual who has recently passed on. This kind of liver transplant costs around INR 24 to 33 lakhs. A living donor liver transplant is where a section of the liver is removed from the live donor and given to the patient. Since the liver can regenerate its cells, the area that is transplanted and the remaining section can grow back to standard size. This is the most affordable type of liver transplant, costing about INR 19 to 29 lakhs. Split donation in which the liver of a recently diseased individual is removed, split into two and given to different patients where the liver portions grow back to their normal size. This liver transplant costs around INR 24 to 33 lakhs in India. The choice of hospital can significantly impact the cost of a liver transplant. Factors such as doctors’ consultation fees and hospital room charges, based on whether the patient selects a private, semi-private, or general ward, contribute to the overall expenses. This is where the cost of a liver transplant can differ. Patients have the option to undergo surgery at a government-aided hospital if they have a limited medical budget, or they can choose a more upscale facility at a higher cost. While there may be slight variations in the quality of service among these hospitals, it is crucial for the patient to select a hospital that offers comfort and houses doctors who are familiar with the patient’s condition. The recovery and recuperation period after the surgery requires a significant amount of time spent in the hospital, making this choice even more critical. A liver transplant cannot just be done at any time. The doctor will first consider the patient’s overall health to ensure they are fit for the surgery. Any additional health complications before or after the surgery can add to the overall cost of the liver transplant. There are several scans, blood tests, and other medical procedures before the primary surgery. Each of these tests has different prices and is usually added to the total cost of the surgery. Some patients may need to be admitted to the hospital a couple of days before they can have the surgery or while a donor is found for their liver transplant. At the same time, some patients might need to stay in the hospital longer because the doctors may not see the progress needed to discharge the patient safely. The medications you must take before and after the procedure can also substantially increase the total cost of liver transplants in India. The cost of a liver transplant can also vary based on the city where you are considering getting the procedure done. Here is a list of some of the best hospitals and the cost of liver transplants in these hospitals. Being the capital of India, Delhi is a prominent healthcare hub and provides patients with excellent healthcare. The average cost of a liver transplant in Delhi is around INR 18 lakhs.

Skilled hepatologists in these hospitals help provide patients with expert guidance and care throughout their medical journey. The 10 best liver transplant hospitals in Bangalore include: While private hospitals are known to charge exorbitant amounts, anywhere between 10 and 35 lacs, for liver transplants in recent years, government hospitals such as AIIMS and GB Pant Hospital in Delhi extend this life-saving service to the marginalised and the poor at either no cost or a nominal fee. It is speculated that most government hospitals charge, if at all, between 3 and 5 lacs, which is indeed a very nominal rate and quite affordable by most. In addition to the cost of the liver transplant surgery itself, there are other essential components that patients may need to consider, such as additional tests and medications required during the post-operative period. Since the transplanted liver is a foreign object introduced into the recipient’s body, the immune system may attempt to reject it. As a result, most liver transplant patients require immunosuppressive medications to minimize any immediate immune reactions. After the surgery, the recipient will need to undergo regular check-ups. The typical recovery time for a liver transplant is approximately 15 to 20 days. Some of the post-operative medical tests may include: Liver function tests are usually done to check whether the transplanted liver works well in the recipient’s body. The costs of these tests can be between INR 800 to 1700. Ultrasound: If the doctor finds any abnormalities in the blood tests, they may ask you to carry out an abdominal ultrasound. Usually, this test is also conducted 3 months after the liver transplant surgery. The cost of this can be anywhere between INR 4000 to 8000. Liver Biopsy: Often, a liver biopsy is only needed for doctors to assess any changes in enzymes found in the abdominal or liver image results. This test can cost anywhere between INR 8000 to 12000. Medical procedures often come with a hefty price tag, and even regular healthcare insurance may not cover all the costs, potentially leaving individuals with significant financial burdens. However, there are alternative methods to raise funds for surgeries without resorting to loans or depleting savings. Crowdfunding has emerged as a valuable avenue for raising money to cover transplant surgery. It not only provides financial support but also offers emotional encouragement to patients and their families during their challenging journey towards recovery.
