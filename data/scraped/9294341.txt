 LATEST UPDATES FROM MAY 2023 Presenting on the Future of Transportation at CoMotion MIami 2023 Transportation innovation was the theme of the M2 Startup Challenge at CoMotion Miami 2023. Our CEO Jeral Poskey presented our vision for the future of transportation and real estate. The event brought together technology, community and business leaders from around the world to design the future landscape of urban mobility.    Swyft Cities in the News As Plano, Texas celebrates its 150th year as a city, Plano Magazine wrote  about how “High-tech gondolas may be the new way to travel in West Plano's shopping districts.” The Plano City Council earlier this year approved the city’s plan to participate in the North Central Texas Council of Government’s (NCTCOG) innovative plan to bring advanced transportation technologies to the region.   The magazine noted that Swyft Cities could be used to connect areas within Plano such as Legacy West and Legacy Town Center, reducing traffic congestion as well as expanding access to regional mass transit.    How’s Parking in Your City? In April, our CEO Jeral Poskey wrote an article in Business Insider on how minimum parking requirements exact a huge toll on cities by using up land that could be used for productive purposes, making affordable housing more difficult, and making cities less sustainable. If you want to find out how your city is doing when it comes to parking, Parking Reform Network has interactive maps that shows which cities have removed or reduced minimum parking requirements. So far, more than 1400 cities have done so.   PRN also has maps that show how much land is taken up by parking in various cities. Check out your city and see how it measures up! STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES NEXT MONTH!   In upcoming issues, I look forward to seeing items that provide more details about the gondola system (still images, live-action videos from the test sites in New Zealand and elsewhere, descriptions of the intended passenger experience, estimations of construction and operating costs in various scenarios, and so forth). Now that you are at the point of discussing actual implementation with municipalities, property developers, etc., it would be nice for these newsletters to provide links to the online materials that you have used in pitches and proposals so far. Thanks, and best wishes for continued success. STRATEGIC PLANNER | DYNAMIC BUSINESS LEADER | FREELANCE WRITER | MARKETING & SALES PROFESSIONAL | PUBLIC FIGURE I spent 4 years working towards PRT implementation in Greenville, SC and we got so close to making it happen. It is time the world realizes the benefits and steps forward with this technology. Keep up the great work. If I may be of service, please advise.
