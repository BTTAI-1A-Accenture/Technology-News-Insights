 Real Estate companies are an industry rooted in building trust & long-lasting relationships. Clients simply do not want to do business with a brand they cannot trust. I believe it is crucial for all real estate companies to instill trust in their clients.  PLUS deliver the product and services that is sold on this promise! Always attempt to go "above and beyond" your clients expectations too!  I believe blockchain & smart contracts are the new technology of TRUST in the real estate industry in 2022 and beyond. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently stated:  Smart contracts take the ideas that we have in terms of financial money transfers and improve them – DRAMATICALLY. No longer do we have to rely on human agreement and manual manipulation. Once a smart contract is set up, the contract will operate on its own based on the exact parameters of the agreement.  After the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, government and wall street execs have spoken about rebuilding trust. But a lack of regulation may make that tricky. BUT I truly believe blockchain and smart contracts are two technologies that will move us from a "FTX meltdown" and help us quickly rebuild in the Bankman-Fried post-apocalyptic collapse. The CEO of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon stated in the Wall Street Journal, “blockchain offers a faster and superior way to confirm transactions related to finance, stock trading, and real estate”. In my opinion, he is spot on, and those applications are just the tip of the iceberg. To me, blockchain & smart contracts can improve: consistency, trust and security as it relates to real estate.  I also strongly believe Florida must prioritize the establishment of a robust cryptocurrency or blockchain industry in the state over the development of a regulatory framework. Having done my first NASDAQ listing in 1996, I have learned over the last three decades: Note: Today the definition of "Intangible Property" is a property without a physical existence. Examples of intangible property include patents, patent applications, trade names, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets. On blockchain, the goal of a smart contract is to simplify business and trade between both anonymous and identified parties, sometimes without the need for a middleman. Importantly, a smart contract scales down on formality and costs associated with traditional methods, without compromising on authenticity and credibility. Smart contracts present a digital alternative to paper-based contracts that most realtors still use, yielding significant benefits in reducing transaction costs, enhancing process efficiency, and ensuring the security of information. Adopting smart contracts will also make more sense in some industries than others. Smart contracts present a digital alternative to paper-based contracts, yielding significant benefits including: Additionally, I have always admired Forrester Research over the decades and certainly think their CEO George Colony nailed the definition of blockchain when he stated: This video is another great overview entitled “How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained “on blockchain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4 Having pioneered web1 and done my first NASDAQ listing in 1996, I am 100% confident that blockchain technology will ultimately revolutionize the real estate industry. AND it is already happening today! Blockchain-based platforms are streamlining the entire real estate transaction process, from start to finish, end of story!  In fact, I loved reading that even Accenture refers to Blockchain as “a new way of storing data in a distributed ledger that allows multiple stakeholders to confidently and securely share access to the same information.” After recently watching “Mini-Madoff” and the crash of FTX – I have been massively disappointed to watch how online fraud and identity theft has only been increasing since COVID-19 hit.  BUT, having been working in the tech space since 1995/6, I know, Blockchain can help mediate the trust between consumers and sellers. Especially, in todays real estate market! With increasing numbers of cases of online identify theft and fraud, a company today must aim to empower consumers to pay with digital currencies. To protect the buyers, the company must be introducing a "purchase protection" mechanism that helps minimize the risk of scams and fraud by providing full payment protection, acting as a third-party mediator during the transaction, and ensuring the delivery of the paid-for product or service. Are you wondering which real estate and banking companies are using blockchain? Here are some of the incredible companies that are using and pioneering blockchain: Founded in 2017 in New York City, RealBlocks has built an advanced alternative investment experience for fund managers and their investors worldwide through its online platform. RealBlocks is a pioneer in using Web3 Blockchain Technology to offer a fully digital, white-label solution for today’s fund managers wishing to expand their firm’s investor base by allowing them to offer more funds in more locations with lower investor minimums. PropertyClub is a premier real estate marketplace in New York City. They use blockchain tech to give you access to the best listings in NYC at the best prices. Earn crypto and cash rewards, including buyer rebates, on your next real estate transaction with PropertyClub! One of the largest real estate companies using blockchain technology is Coldwell Banker. At present, they are an active client of the company PROPY URL: https://propy.com/browse/ Basically, Coldwell is using the platform to list sellers and agents, along with offering transactions as well. More so, with this platform, they can secure all their transactions and contracts without any issues. Westfield is using blockchain for real estate bank guarantees. It’s mainly for the people who are leaseholders in the retail markets. Anyhow, Westfield’s live project will last eight-week, and they will determine if the technology works for them or not. However, they are more than optimistic that it will help them to issue commercial leases easily. RealT allows users to grow a global real estate portfolio easily and affordably through the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, investors around the globe can buy into the US real estate market through fully compliant, fractional, tokenized ownership. Powered by blockchain. Additionally, I would personally like to thank Samuel Armes, the Founder of the Florida Blockchain Business Association for the leading the discussion here in Florida on Regulatory Issues presented by #Blockchain #Technology and #Virtual #Currency" available to the public. And, as a web1 pioneer, I totally agree and support Sam's statement:  "#Florida has an opportunity to stand out through wise policy choices that will balance the needs of Florida’s businesses and allow them to thrive while enabling such businesses to easily ascertain the boundaries of acceptable conduct." I believe blockchain is poised to give the real estate industry an incredible boost and leg up into 2023. Importantly, leveraging distributed ledger technology (DLT), will increase trust through greater transparency.  By 2023, organizations using blockchain smart contracts will increase overall data quality by 50% but reduce data availability by 30%, conversely creating positive data and analytics ROI. By 2023, graph technologies will facilitate rapid contextualization for decision making in 30% of organizations worldwide Importantly, in real estate, trust of a company, website, an agent/broker, a listing — is critical. Especially after the massive crypto debacle of FTX and its wunderkind former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  Real estate blockchain & smart contracts expedite contract processes, save massive amounts of time, reduce costs AND are a very reliable way to carry out real estate transaction!  Don't you or your client require trust, transparency, and anonymity among all stakeholders?  I TRUST YOU.  ###END About Geoff De Weaver: Geoff De Weaver, CEO - Limitless USA LLC | Realtor - Luxury Real Estate Agent at Keller Williams on the Water Sarasota Talks about #brands, #marketing, #metaverse, #blockchain, #smartcontracts, #nft and #realestate  Geoff De Weaver is an award-winning Silicon Valley & Madison Avenue media executive, who has lived and worked globally (e.g., Asia, North America, South America, Europe, and Australia) with a track record of pioneering digital marketing and launching cutting edge content and technology to drive revenue, audience engagement and brand loyalty.
