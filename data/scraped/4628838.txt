   Date (MENAFN) Norfolk Southern, the railway company involved in the East Palestine train derailment last month, has revealed that some of its railcars in a different derailment had loose wheels. The Springfield, Ohio derailment happened on Sunday, and investigators discovered that a specific model and series of railcars had loose wheels, which is being regarded as an urgent safety issue. The wheels were found on recently acquired railcars from a specific manufacturer, although the company did not identify the manufacturer, or say how many of the railcars were involved in the Springfield crash. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

On the same day that Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw appeared before a Senate panel to address the East Palestine crisis, he announced the findings of the Springfield derailment. He also vowed the company would clean the East Palestine site thoroughly, and with urgency, and added that $20 million had been set aside for reimbursements and investments for families and first responders affected by the incident. Shaw has been criticized, along with state and federal officials, for their response to the East Palestine incident.

In the Springfield incident, 20 cars of a 212-car train derailed, causing around 1,000 residents to shelter in place as a precaution, while approximately 1,500 people lost power. There were no toxic chemicals involved. The Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were notified and began inspecting other cars from this series on Norfolk Southern's network.

The East Palestine incident occurred on February 3rd, when a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous materials derailed, causing 38 cars to derail, with around 10 containing hazardous materials. Hundreds of residents were evacuated, and toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, were later released in a controlled manner because of the risk of an explosion. The company has faced significant criticism over its response to the incident, with local residents concerned about the long-term health risks caused by the contamination.MENAFN12032023000045014228ID1105756321 MENAFN12032023000045014228ID1105756321 MENAFN12032023000045014228ID1105756321
