The good news is that it typically doesnât take long. And you can check on your application to see where it stands. Learn how long it might take Capital One to make a decision about your application and how you can check your application status. Key takeaways It usually doesnât take Capital One long to review your credit card application. If you apply online or by phone, you might get a quicker decision than other methods. You can check your Capital One credit card application status online or by phone. Missing information or errors on your application could cause a delay in processing.  There are two ways to check the status of your application: Online: After you submitted your application, you should have received an email from Capital One. That email contains a unique link that will take you to the application center. While there, you can review your application status. If necessary, you can also upload additional information needed to process your application. To access the application center, youâll need the last four digits of your Social Security number (SSN), your birth date and your ZIP code.  Phone: You can check the status of your Capital One credit card application anytime by calling 800-903-9177.  How long it takes Capital One to make a decision about your application typically depends on how you apply. If you apply by phone or online, youâll typically get a response within 60 seconds. If you submit a paper application, it will take longer. But no matter how you apply, Capital One generally notifies applicants of the decision in writing within seven to 10 days of receiving the application.  If youâre denied, learn more about why you may not be getting approved for a credit card.

Some new Capital One cardholders may be able to start spending and earning rewards without having to wait for a physical card to arrive in the mail. Thatâs thanks to virtual cards, which stand in for actual card numbers and can be used almost anywhere you shop or pay online. There are three primary ways to use virtual cards from Capital One: Generate virtual cards with Eno, your Capital One assistant, through the Eno browser extension. Use virtual cards through Google Pay when you shop online using Chrome or in Android apps. Access your virtual card after signing in through the Capital One Mobile app or online. If youâre curious, thereâs plenty more to read about how to use virtual cards and some of the benefits. There are a few reasons why a credit cardâs application status may be delayed: In some cases, Capital One may need to verify the information in your application or collect additional information before approving or declining your application. When you apply for a Capital One credit card, Capital One requires the following information: Full name Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)    Date of birth Physical address Estimated annual gross income Checking and/or savings account information If all the information listed above isnât included or if additional information is required, it could take longer to process your application. Accidental errors on the application may cause a delay in processing. For example, mistyping your date of birth or incorrectly inputting your address can result in mismatching information between your credit report and your application. In this case, additional details may be needed in order to process your application. Freezing your credit reports is a way to restrict access as a security measure. This can keep identity thieves from being able to use your personal information to open new accounts in your name. But having a frozen credit report can also prevent you from opening new lines of credit.  You may want to unfreeze your credit report to prevent delays. You can unfreeze your credit on a  permanent or temporary basis. But to do so you must contact each of the three credit bureaus where you originally froze your credit. Keep in mind that requesting a thaw online is typically fastest. As opposed to requesting over the phone or by mail. Capital One online applications often get a response in as few as 60 seconds. If your application is delayed, you can scroll up to learn a few reasons why. Be sure to keep an eye on the email you provided. That way if Capital One requests additional information, you can respond quickly. But if you havenât already submitted an application, there are a few things you could do to help the process run smoothly. See if youâre pre-approved. By answering a few questions and sharing some personal information, you can see which Capital One cards youâre pre-approved for. After you choose the offer thatâs best for you, you can finish your application by answering a few more questions. Pre-approval wonât harm your credit. But finishing the application does require a credit inquiry, which could temporarily drop your credit scores. Apply online. Online applications often take less time than applying via mail. You could get an answer in as few as 60 seconds. Review your application carefully. Errors in your application can cause delays in approval. As youâre filling out your application, review each field carefully. Make sure things like your name, address, birthdate and SSN are accurate. If you notice any errors, fix them before you submit your application. It typically doesnât take long for Capital One to review a credit card application. If youâre curious about the status of your application, you can easily check online or by phoneâwhichever is more convenient for you.  Once youâve been approved, check out some tips for using your credit card responsibly to build your credit.
