The project is expected to capture two million tons of CO2 annually. Paris/France – Technip Energies, together with Shell Catalysts & Technologies and Zachry Group, have been awarded a Front-End Engineering and Design (Feed) contract for a carbon capture unit project in Baytown, Texas, USA. The project will be designed to capture two million tons per annum of CO2, which represents 95 % of CO2 emissions from processed flue gas from Calpine’s Baytown Energy Center (BTEC) and a natural gas combined cycle power plant (CCGT). Technip Energies and Shell Catalysts & Technologies have a strategic alliance to collaborate on the marketing, licensing and execution of projects using Shell’s Cansolv CO2 Capture System technology. The two organizations recently strengthened this alliance, which began in 2012, to allow them to better respond to the rapidly growing carbon capture and storage (CCS) market and the need for affordable and proven solutions. Zachry’s scope in the Feed study will include outside battery limits (OSBL) engineering, which includes utility systems, loading and off-loading facilities, operation and maintenance buildings, and site preparation. Zachry will also conduct detailed construction planning and estimating for the overall project, with the ultimate development of a final EPC cost estimate and schedule development.
