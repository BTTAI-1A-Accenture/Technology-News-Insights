THE United States government recently supported the development of 20 startups that offer sustainable solutions to environmental issues in Cagayan de Oro, Dumaguete, and Manila.On July 21, the US Embassy’s American Spaces Philippines and The Spark Project concluded the Green Impact Accelerator (GIA) bootcamp, a five-month program that supported the growth and commercial viability of green startups through mentorship, networking, and crowdfunding matching.Of the 20 solutions presented, three startups were selected to receive seed funding to develop, implement, and scale up their projects: Cagayan de Oro’s Kids Who Farm, which established Food Loop, a circular food system concept and technology that helps households convert edible material waste into organic components for growing food; Dumaguete’s Plantsville Health, which developed Green LiveS, an artificial intelligence-powered system that can record and monitor Philippine cinnamon production; and Manila’s Dewaste Solutions, which created MARE!, a modular and portable materials recycling facility that promotes environmental sustainability through education and provides employment for women in waste management.“We are very excited to finally run an accelerator program that caters to enterprises that positively impact the environment,” The Spark Project CEO and founder Patch Dulay said.“I believe that programs like these not only level-up entrepreneurs and their businesses, but also connect them to a like-minded community that is eager to support their work,” Dulay added.“This program is part of the United States’ commitment to support environmental resilience and promote inclusive economic growth,” said US Embassy Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer Pauline Anderson. “The projects we saw in this program showcase the Philippine startup community and how their talents can build sustainable ecosystems and help achieve prosperity.”GIA teams will reconvene in October for the American Spaces Angel Investing Seminar where they will be matched with potential investors and benefit from seed funding opportunities.
