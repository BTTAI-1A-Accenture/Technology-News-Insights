 This will make you think. On Harmony vs Balance. In conversations, therapy sessions, personal ruminations, etc., how often have you heard: you need to find the balance between *insert one extreme here* and *insert the opposite extreme here*? All the time! Actually, I said something similar in a post from last week. However, a good friend sparked a different way of thinking about this with a single word: "Harmony". I think the word "harmony" better captures what living a fulfilled and well-rounded life looks like. Certain visualizations helped me understand this better. The word "balance" brings the image of a seesaw to mind. At any point in time, it can either be tilted to one side or the other. However, the word "harmony" brings to mind a musical chord or a symphony/orchestra. Multiple individual components, each unique on their own, come together to create an even larger, richer, and also unique sound. One reason why this analogy is so relevant is that it better captures the complexity that is often encountered in reality. A seesaw has just two ends, but in real life, there are multiple parameters and multiple competing priorities, all fighting for the top spot. Music has a similar complexity, yet it is intuitively understood and appreciated by humans across time and space. No matter how complex a musical piece is or how many instruments are involved, one can typically tell when an instrument is out of tune, a voice is off-key, or a note is mistimed, whether they are trained musicians or not (it just doesn’t feel right). Similarly when one of the components(notes) e.g. family, work, physical health, healthy relationships etc. needed for a holistic, well-rounded life (a good sounding chord or orchestral piece) is missing, there is a nagging intuition: this just doesn’t sound right. All those components need to work together to produce a well-sounding whole. This has really helped me conceptualize how I ought to live and pattern my life in the years to come. C.S Lewis talked about this same concept of harmony but in relation to virtues. He talks about how to be truly good requires a harmony of different virtues. Kindness without honesty and truth is not good for the recipient in the long run; it hides faults, inadequacies, and weaknesses and ill prepares them for the harsh realities of the world. Brutal honesty without an underlying motive of care or compassion (for the betterment of the individual) can be cruel or insensitive. Unbridled bravado or courage without training or competence can lead to great loss. Charisma without character typically ends up in betrayal/scandal. These virtues need to work together, like a musical piece. The right note or combination of notes at a particular time, in the right sequence, makes for a well-sounding score at the end. A first-century Jewish writer summarizes everything above most beautifully when he penned: “So don’t lose a minute in building on what you’ve been given, complementing your basic faith with good character, spiritual understanding, alert discipline, passionate patience, reverent wonder, warm friendliness, and generous love, each dimension fitting into and developing the others. With these qualities active and growing in your lives, no grass will grow under your feet, no day will pass without its reward……” I’ll stop here for now. I hope this inspired, challenged or educated someone. With Love, Lota. Software Engineer | Creating Solutions That Solve Real World Problems | Lateral Thinker Loved this read! Thank you Lota
