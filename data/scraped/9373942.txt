  Teachmint, a leading education infrastructure provider and creator of the Integrated School Platform, has demonstrated tremendous progress in driving the education digitization movement in India. The company announced that it has digitized schools across the length and breadth of the country, over 70% belonging to Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This includes states from J&K to Kerala, Gujarat to Manipur. 
Its immense growth in just a year is on the back of its flagship product, the Integrated School Platform, launched in late 2021 to enable schools to digitize their operations, help teachers and faculty save time, eliminate errors, increase teaching efficiency, cut operating costs and become future-ready. Since its launch in late 2021, Teachmint has served 10,000+ schools, 1.6 crore+ users and expanded to 30+ countries across South East Asia, Middle East and Africa. Further, the platform has also empowered schools to become NEP 2020-ready with its digital infra offerings, enabling schools to make data powered decisions, monitor teacher and student progress with comprehensive insights and drive real-time engagement with parents.

Commenting on the milestone, Divyansh Bordia, COO & Co-founder of Teachmint, said, “Our vision at Teachmint is to empower schools and educational institutes with our first-of-its-kind Integrated School Platform. In the past 1 year, we have seen exponential adoption of our platform, an indication of the immense acceptance of digitization among school leaders. I strongly believe that tech-integration can help schools unlock their highest potential. With NEP 2020 also putting the spotlight on digitization, we expect more and more schools to adopt technology and start reaping its benefits in the near future.”

Since its inception, Teachmint has been pioneering the education digitization movement by building the digital infrastructure for education. The company believes that SaaS has immense potential to bring in much needed transformations in the education ecosystem and drive better outcomes for all the stakeholders of a school – students, teachers, administrators and parents. As schools have reopened the past year, Teachmint has seen high adoption of its offerings, and the company strives to continue building deeper capabilities to strengthen it.

Focused on enabling schools to seamlessly incorporate NEP 2020 policies, Teachmint also recently signed a partnership with OrangeSlates, a leading educator upskilling platform, to help professional development and upskilling of school teachers across India. With this partnership, various courses are available on Teachmint’s Integrated School Platform for all its school partners, enabling educators to learn, train and upskill conveniently to learn, practice, and revisit topics as needed. Courses include a wide range of topics, such as Making the most of digital tools like Microsoft Word, Managing special education needs, Bringing Experiential Learning to Classrooms, Gamifying Assessments, Interpersonal Skills, and more.
