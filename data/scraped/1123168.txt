The purchase will triple the firm's customer base We have more newsletters We have more newsletters Belfast software company ProAptivity has bought a Bedford peer for a “six-figure” sum. The acquisition of JI Software is expected to triple ProAptivity’s customer base –bringing both Cambridge and Oxford University onto its client list – and help it achieve a target of 40% turnover growth in the next three years. Although not disclosing the financial size of the deal, it said three new employees will be joining from JI software. ProAptivity was founded in 2011 and provided software solutions for a range of public, private and third sector organisations, particularly customer relationship management technology. Niall McCaffrey, Managing Director of ProAptivity, said the deal widens the skills base for the firm. “The takeover provides ProAptivity with complementary skills to further develop our CRM transformation capabilities, develop our offering and support our ambitious growth strategy by increasing our customer base across the United Kingdom and Ireland,” he said. “The service we offer helps organisations keep information up to date, communicate with their stakeholders, fulfil compliance obligations and ensure they gain organisational insight. “We are helping our clients do incredible things, for example, we work with universities to ensure they support students with disabilities to achieve their full potential in 3rd level education. This has resulted in the reduction in the level of students that leave education due to their disabilities, the universities have been fully aware of what help and resources the individual students need and have been able to provide this assistance to ensure they flourish in their education.”
