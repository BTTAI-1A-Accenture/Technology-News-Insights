   Buy side Derivatives Markets Bank of America became the top provider of interest rate swaptions to US life insurers in the second half of 2022, overtaking Morgan Stanley, an analysis of insurance company filings by Risk.net finds. The bank’s trading relationships with insurers including Jackson National, MetLife and New York Life helped drive growth in the value of business conducted with providers of life and annuity cover. MetLife, the largest user of swaptions in the US life insurance market by notional value at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, with positions totalling $40 billion, was a flagship client of Bank of America, according to the data aggregated from industry disclosures. Bank of America’s book stood at roughly $26 billion during the same quarter. The growth of MetLife’s notional, which doubled in Q4 compared to the previous quarter, pushed the combined total of life insurers’ swaption books to $165 billion from $122 billion in Q3. That was the largest total in all four quarters included in the analysis going back to the start of last year. The full figures are available on Counterparty Radar, Risk.net’s platform that covers trading activity across 11 derivatives instruments. The tool also includes the data of US mutual funds and exchange-traded funds parsed from filings made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Deutsche Bank was the counterparty for MetLife’s largest trade in the fourth quarter – the insurer bought an $11 billion receive-fixed option on SOFR that expires in November 2024. The trade helped propel Deutsche up the dealer rankings from fourth to second place, while its share of the US life insurance market rose 7 percentage points to 15% by swaptions notional. “Go big or go home” was an apt motto for Lincoln Financial’s swaptions activity in Q4. The insurer made just two trades, both with NatWest Markets, totalling about $5 billion in gross notional. The directionality of the trades wasn’t disclosed but Lincoln sold one option to NatWest and bought another one, which could be seen as a kind of interest rate collar strategy. Morgan Stanley increased the notional value of swaptions conducted with life insurers by 40% to $22.6 billion over the fourth quarter. Brighthouse Insurance was the second most-active user of swaptions after MetLife in Q4 by notional value. Brighthouse increased the value of its swaptions book by almost 100% to $28 billion over the quarter from $14 billion in Q3. Jackson National accounted for $25 billion of swaptions notional in Q4, up 14% from the previous quarter. Other carrier’s swaptions activity remained stable, including Corebridge Financial (AIG’s former life and annuities business), New York Life and Prudential. Mizuho overtook Citi to reach sixth place in the dealer rankings, with $8 billion of trades conducted across 26 tickets. Eighth-placed Crédit Agricole is named on a greater value of US life insurer trades than Goldman Sachs, the data shows. In 13% of trades, the dealer counterparty was not disclosed. The information used in this analysis comes from US life insurer filings to state insurer commissioners. The filings include over-the-counter derivatives trades that were live at the time of the filing, and show details such as bank counterparty names, currencies, trade sizes and remaining maturity. The forms are filed to insurer commissioners on a quarterly basis, and the regulators makes the final filing of each fund’s quarter public roughly 60 days after the end of that period.  It’s important to caveat the information. While these are pro forma regulatory filings and should be accurate, mistakes and miscategorisations do occur. The data was cleaned and obvious errors excluded. As the database is updated and improved periodically, data presented may not mirror information published in previous stories. Each story reflects the most accurate representation of data at the time of publication. Information from these filings is also the basis for a new tool, Counterparty Radar, which also includes data from mutual funds and exchange-traded funds and allows users to search the filings information themselves to discover the most popular dealers and most active buy-side firms for a range of OTC derivatives. We will track these stats every quarter, so please get in touch if something doesn’t look right, or to suggest other ways to present the data: michael.paterakis@infopro-digital.com Correction, 11 April: Due to a typo, a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Lincoln Financial's two trades with NatWest Markets amounted to $50 billion in notional. The actual figure was approximately $5 billion in notional. Only users who have a paid subscription or are part of a corporate subscription are able to print or copy content.
