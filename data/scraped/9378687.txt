Carkenord Elementary learning doesn’t stop when the bell rings nor when summer vacation begins.Thanks to a couple of teachers who think outside the box, Carkenord has a writing trail and garden where students and their families, and even their neighbors can learn about plants, nature and nurturing or read outdoors anytime they want. There’s even a classroom with benches in case a parent or grandparent feels inspired to read aloud in the great outdoors.“This space here at Carkenord is the result of several grants,” said Sarah D’Agostini, who along with Kristy O’Donovan-Korte applied for three grants totaling about $5,000 to install the garden, benches and book trail.“It’s a very magical creative space and the kids have really responded to it,” D’Agostini said, while watching her children, Henry, 6, and Francesca, 3, skipping across the stones in the garden.“This one,” said Francesca, singling out a grouping of bright red flowers as her favorites.Henry agreed.They are the nicest and growing quite well due in part to the care provided by Linda Fleury, a friendly bus driver who lives in the neighborhood and has offered to help out in the garden. Although planted almost 20 years ago, it remains an experience shared by students who attend Carkenord Elementary, from the pioneering pupils who cleared the soil and installed the plants several decades ago, to the incoming students overseeing its care.Henry and Francesca D’Agostini enjoy the garden at Joseph M.

“A lot of schools use the money to buy books but we used it for this,” said D’Agostini, who shares her passion for teaching with O’Donovan-Korte.Both of them are third grade teachers who remain enthusiastic about their careers, which span some 20 years and mirror each other.“We got our masters together (Saginaw Valley University) and our educational specialist degree and Ph.D from OU (Oakland University),” O’Donovan-Korte said proudly. “We’re both highly motivated.”D’Agostini concurred.“As educators we’re always looking for new and unique ways to reach our students and make them enthusiastic about the process,” D’Agostini said, adding everyone is invited to enjoy the space writing trail, which currently features poetry that was selected by Carkenord’s third-graders including works by Robert Frost, Edgar Allen Poe and Jack Prelutsky.During their visit with Henry and Francesca, D’Agostini and O’Donovan-Korte read the poems aloud in the same animated style as they use in the classroom, a tradition that older students fondly remember.“I was looking out the window one day and saw one of our former students doing all of the motions we did during a poetry recital,” O’Donovan-Korte said, which shows it’s had an impact.Now as summer begins both teachers are urging families to stop by.“We want to remind parents that it’s here,” D’Agostini said. “So, this summer, enjoy being outdoors and reading at the same time, when you visit Carkenord Elementary’s Writing Trail.”Among the biogaphies geared for children is “Who Were the Beatles.”Great books for summer readingCarkenord Elementary’s Writing Trail features a selection of poetry but families are encouraged to bring a blanket and even their own books to read in the outdoor classroom and garden.In case you need a few suggestions on what books your child might wish to read, here are five books for summer reading suggested by D’Agostini, O’Donovan-Korte and other teachers:“The Relatives Came,” by Cynthia RylandIt’s summer and a family is about to get a visit from their relatives, who arrive in a rainbow-colored station wagon.
