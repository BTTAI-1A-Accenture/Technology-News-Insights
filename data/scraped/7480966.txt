BERLIN — A medical facility in the city of Dessau in central Germany will be temporarily used to produce the single-jab Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine over the coming three months, the manufacturer said Monday. The vaccine got conditional approval for use in Europe last week, and the production deal will see IDT Biologika suspend output of its dengue fever jab for three months and shift output to the J&J vaccine. Units will be available for worldwide production, IDT Biologika said. "Vaccine production in Europe, and in Germany, increases delivery security and is a very important signal in the current phase of the pandemic," said German Economics Minister Peter Altmaier following the announcement. The problem, as was previously reported, is that the first doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine aren't likely to hit Europe until April at the earliest. In total, the European Commission has secured 200 million doses of the vaccine, with the option to purchase 200 million more. The jab is easier to use than the three others so far approved for use in the EU because only a single dose is required for protection, and vials can be stored in a normal refrigerator for up to three months. The Germans will also get training and spare parts. Europe should look beyond space internet and start planning for a military-grade surveillance system instead. Germany and other Ukraine allies have been reluctant to allow Ukraine to hit Russia, but the latest offensive may be shifting policy. Kyiv hasn’t commented officially on the military action, but Ukrainian MP Oleksiy Goncharenko said: “Everything is according to plan.”
