 Zendesk Sell offers one centralized place to manage all your business’s contacts and leads, creating a holistic view of each. Using this data, you can personalize every interaction you have with leads. For example, by understanding the stage in which your lead is in the customer journey, you can easily create a filtered list of other leads at that stage, then send a targeted bulk email to help all of them move to the next stage of the buying journey. To make the process even easier, Zendesk Sell’s email sequences allow you to automate your emails throughout the customer journey. At first contact with a lead, you can create an introductory welcome email, then add future emails to the sequence to move leads from one stage to another until they reach the conversion (or purchase) stage, at which point a sales representative can reach out to them. Zendesk Sell’s reporting features help you to improve your current conversion rates while forecasting successes and potential failures in the future. You can, for example, view your likely revenue during a specific time period. If that forecast is low, you know to pivot your marketing strategy to boost that revenue. One way to solve problems is by accessing Zendesk Sell’s pipeline analysis reports. Here, you can detect any bottlenecks that stand in the way of leads’ progression to the conversion stage. Use this information to test how you might break through those bottlenecks to boost future revenue. Analytics reports that show all channels with which leads interact with your brand give you granular insights into where problems may lie.

 This best-of list is a result of careful evaluation of over 45 popular marketing CRMs among small businesses. To choose the top five small business marketing CRMs, we looked at the following factors: There are five basic steps to choosing the right marketing CRM for your company. They include figuring out your budget, listing what features you need, getting input on most-needed features from your team, researching your options and testing out your top CRM options as a team to land on the best one to meet your company’s needs. As a small business, your starting point to choosing a marketing CRM is figuring out how much you can spend per month or per year on the software. Many CRM companies charge per user, so break down your monthly budget on a per-user basis. Then, decide if you can pay annually. This is important because most leading CRMs offer as much as a 20% discount if you can pay annually for your software subscription. To gather a list of your required features, make a list of what you want your company to be able to do or accomplish with your marketing CRM. Some examples could be to learn more about leads or customers, attract new leads, send out segmented email sequences, automate tasks to save time, streamline communications with leads or customers, solve customer problems more efficiently or forecast revenue. From your perspective, your list of required features may be comprehensive. But your team members may feel differently. It is important to get your teams’ eyes on your list so they can add features they know to be important to meeting their company-benefiting goals. In this, be thorough. Allow team members from different parts and levels of your organization to add their own required features. Now that you have a thorough idea of the feature list you know will make your CRM most useful to meeting company goals, conduct a simple Google search on “best marketing CRMs.” Look through the resulting lists of marketing CRMs and their described features to determine two to three options that will most closely align with your budget and feature requirements. Most small business marketing CRMs have either a free starter version or a free trial. Use one of these options to test your short list of CRMs for free, then allow a sampling of your team to try out each software and give you feedback. Choose the CRM you and your team agree best meets your company’s needs.

Collected data may include people’s demographics, purchase history and interactions across digital channels, among other data points. In turn, companies gain a holistic view of each lead or customer. Businesses can then use the insights derived from this holistic view to create personalized campaigns that are more likely to lead to purchases. As a baseline capability for most marketing CRMs, using data surrounding leads’ interactions on the company website, companies can use marketing CRMs to set up automated email marketing. By basing each email sequence on leads’ likely interests, budget and where they are in the buyer’s journey, companies can nurture leads from their current point in the customer journey all the way to a purchase decision. A business could, for example, pinpoint a lead as being in the decision phase of the buyer’s journey, then create an email sequence that not only prompts them to decide to buy, but then later upsells them at appropriate times and with appropriate product pitches so customers view the upsell as a welcomed solution rather than spam. In the end, the benefits of marketing CRM capabilities are numerous. They include advanced segmentation, marketing efficiency, seamless communication, in-depth analytics and, ultimately, higher conversions, customer retention and lifetime customer values. Companies can even use collected data to forecast revenue. Likewise, if forecasts show subpar sales performance, companies can test ways proactively to solve problems before they arise. Staff Reviewer Kelly Main contributed to this article. A marketing CRM software gathers and stores data about your leads, then uses marketing tools and that data to nurture them through to a purchase. Included tools, such as email templates, automated email sequences, analytic reports showing how leads interact with your company across channels and automated campaign personalization make marketing easier, more efficient and more effective. There are numerous marketing CRMs on the market and they vary in pricing and feature set. Depending on what you’re looking for, there are marketing CRMs that are very inexpensive to use per month. On the other end of the spectrum, enterprise-level systems can cost thousands of dollars per month. Ultimately, there is a marketing CRM to fit just about any business size and budget. The best CRM for your small business depends on many factors, including your goals, industry, budget and required unique features. However, overall, Zoho CRM offers the best mix of price and features for many small businesses. Useful features include cross-channel analytics reports, forecasting capabilities, pipeline management, email marketing, automation tools and a complete view of your leads’ interests and interactions with your company. The marketing tools within many CRMs offer the ability to gather data on qualified leads, analyze that data and put that data to use to create personalized campaigns that nurture leads to a purchase. As such, a CRM can help you learn about your target markets, reach marketing goals, such as effectively targeting your audience and, in turn, boost engagement metrics and conversion rates. There are many types of CRM for different teams or needs, even though it’s traditionally used by sales teams. Look for the best marketing CRM software, which should include tools to automate marketing campaigns, or real estate CRM, which focuses on communication tools, such as click-to-call and text messaging within the app.
