Cyberpunk 2077 developer Paweł Sasko recently answered some questions from fans about the game on a Twitch stream. A viewer asked him about his opinion on fans criticizing Cyberpunk 2077’s linear story. Sasko said that he thinks it is completely justified. He thinks that players expected more from the game, even though it has a lot of quests. He also highlighted the fact that players can play the game twice and have different experiences; however, it is not enough for them. He also said that after The Witcher 3, players had many expectations with CD Projekt RED's next venture. Sasko said that CD Projekt RED could have done better with the story and said if he was in the player’s shoes, he would also expect more. YouTuber Rob Cram took a look at a few Cyberpunk 2077 mods in a recent video, such as the one that adds stock market and news to the game, as well as smart windows and the Mega Building H10. The stock market mod adds a “fully useable stock market system” that reacts according to the player’s actions. It even shows news that goes with the decisions the player makes. Another mod expands the H10 building and adds interior areas such as floors and corridors that are accessible. If you wanted a smart window similar to the one showed in the 2018 E3 Demo, then there’s a mod for that too. It adds interactive features and stock market integration via an intuitive smart window panel.
