Badji's inclusion in the Matchday 22 Team of the Matchday marks his first inclusion of the season and the 25th time an FCC player has been named this year. Saturday's 2-2 result for FCC was the first time they did not win an MLS match at TQL Stadium this season. The Orange and Blue remain atop the MLS table, six points clear of Nashville SC for the Supporter's Shield. FCC is back in action on Saturday at Charlotte FC. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. For more on Badji's selection to Team of the Matchday, and to see the full Matchday 22 team, click here.
