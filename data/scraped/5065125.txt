Beth Ross, 36, and Sarah Humber, 39, are alleged to have acted together in the thefts from the chemist in King Street, Maidstone. Officers on patrol on the road yesterday noticed a security alarm had been activated as a woman pushing a pram was walking out of the chemist. February 14 Police spoke to her and then seized a quantity of suspected stolen cosmetics. One of the officers then entered the store where members of staff directed them to a second woman who was pushing a pram towards the exit. She was stopped and more suspected stolen property was seized. Both women were detained and taken into custody.
