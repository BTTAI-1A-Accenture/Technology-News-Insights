             In November last year, I was humbled and honoured to learn that I had been awarded a Fellowship with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand.
 
Last week, I attended a Gala dinner where I was formally presented with my Fellowship certificate.  After thanking my family, my peers, my business partner and CA ANZ, I congratulated the 37 new Chartered Accountants and Accounting Technicians present at the event. I then had some messages for them that I think are appropriate to share here. 
 
Number one: Never stop growing. Keep expanding your knowledge. Seek out new skills and stay curious.
 
Number two: No one succeeds alone. Teamwork is key. Excel at working with others towards a common goal.
 
Number three: Integrity matters. Have a strong moral compass. Make decisions that align with your values.
 
Number Four: Setbacks and mistakes happen. The key is to bounce back quickly. Learn from failures and come back stronger.
 
Number Five: Above all, give back. When you're able to, help others. Mentor, volunteer, involve yourself with your community.
 
Let me know if you need help with your career. I'd love to chat.
