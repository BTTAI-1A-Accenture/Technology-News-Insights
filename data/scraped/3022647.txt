Built in 1984, the almost 120,000 square-foot building was sold by Arlington-based SkyWalker Property Partners. The building was acquired by a company headed by Howard Heald of Silver Creek Realty Advisors LLC. Brookhollow Riverside is about 90% leased. SkyWalker Property had owned the building since 2006.

SkyWalker Property also sold a McKinney office complex. Crescent Parc is a 61-unit, almost 6-acre medical and office condominium campus at 1400 N. Coit Road. The seller invested in the project starting in 2021 when it completed construction on the more than 64,000-square-foot offices. Joe Martinez and Tonya La Barbera of Legacy Commercial Realty brokered the sale. SkyWalker Property was formed in 2017 and has overseen a $200 million portfolio of office, industrial and retail properties in Texas and surrounding states. Steve Brown, Real Estate Editor.
