As a front-end designer, you need to test and optimize your web pages for performance, usability, and functionality. One of the essential tools for this task is the developer tools, also known as devtools, that are built into most modern browsers. In this article, you will learn how to use developer tools to track and analyze network requests and responses, which are the interactions between your browser and the web server that deliver the content and resources of your web page.
 
Network requests and responses are the messages that your browser sends and receives from the web server when you load or interact with a web page. They include information such as the URL, the method, the headers, the body, the status, and the size of the data exchanged. Network requests and responses can affect the speed, security, and functionality of your web page, so it is important to monitor and inspect them to identify and fix any issues or inefficiencies.

            Open the developer tools in your browser (typically by pressing F12 or right-clicking and choosing "Inspect") to monitor and examine network requests and responses. Go to the tab labeled "Network". All network activity, including requests and responses as well as the headers, status codes, and durations that go along with it, are visible to you here. In addition to analyzing performance measures like load times and file sizes, you can search for specific requests and filter requests based on their kind.

            Network requests & responses are communication between client & server, for retrieving/sending data. Typically when loading a web page via the request-response cycle:

1. Initiation: Client creates a request by sending an HTTP request to a URL.

2. Processing: Server processes the request, performs necessary operations, & generates response.

3. Delivery: Server sends the response back to the client, which may include HTML content, JSON data, or other resources.

4. Rendering: Client then interprets the response.

Requests & responses include headers & bodies. Headers provide information about the request/response, e.g. content type, encoding, & authentication details. The body of the request/response is actual data being sent or received.

            ◆ Network requests and responses are the core communication processes between a web browser (client) and a server. When a browser loads a web page, it sends requests to the server for resources like :  
✔️HTML
✔️CSS
✔️JavaScript
✔️images, and data etc ...

 ⭐The server responds with the requested content, which the browser then uses to render the page. Understanding and analyzing these requests and responses using developer tools is crucial for optimizing website performance and troubleshooting issues in frontend development. 
            Front-end Developer
            In order for a client to have access to the data it needs, for instance to render, the client should send some requests through URLs to a server which is responsible for keeping and protecting the relevant data, and in response, if the request has been sent properly and meets the server's requirements for a response to be valid, the server sends the relevant data to the client side in order to be used. 
To access developer tools, you can use a keyboard shortcut, a menu option, or a context menu option, depending on your browser and operating system. For example, on Chrome for Windows, you can press Ctrl+Shift+I, click on the three-dot menu and select More tools > Developer tools, or right-click on any element of the web page and select Inspect. Once you open developer tools, you will see a panel with various tabs, such as Elements, Console, Sources, Network, and so on. Each tab provides different features and functions for debugging and testing your web page.

            VP of Development at RELENTLESS Venture Studio
            One thing to keep in mind is that Lighthouse testing may not reflect your users' actual conditions, and therefore, their experience with your application. Lighthouse allows you to simulate real world conditions with simulated connection throttling and device emulation, but it's not the end-all, be-all for testing.

Perspective is important too: scoring 100% across all metrics is something to strive for, but may not be attainable, depending on your application's requirements. A quick Lighthouse run against a handful of major brands' sites, reveals many poor scores, despite those brands having entire teams dedicated to optimizing performance.

Also, success is transitory: performance testing must be an ongoing process, not a one-time event.
