The Department of Information and Service Management refers to the creative use of information and digital technology in business and the move from industrial to service dominant forms of production. The increased use of software and advanced analytics in private and public sectors has created a need for business graduates who can work at the interface of business and technology in various managerial or expert positions. The research at the Department of Information and Service Management is broadly divided into three disciplines: information systems science, management science and logistics, with topics such as digital service development, service networks, behavioral decision making, and data science. The department deals with adoption, use and impacts of ICT on consumers, companies, and society. Logistics focuses on operations and supply chain management. Management science deals with the application of advanced analytical methods in decision making. The department hosts also the Real-time Economy Competence Center. 
        Information Systems Science at Aalto University School of Business has a strong focus on empirical studies and active cooperation with companies. Besides theoretical contributions, ISS studies often emphasize practical relevance. 
       
        Logistics in Aalto University School of Business focuses on operations management and supply chain management including both theoretical and application oriented research.
       
        Management Science deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. The terms operations research and business analytics are sometimes used as synonyms for management science.
       
        Real-Time Economy is an environment where all the transactions between business parties are in digital format, increasingly automatically generated, and completed in real-time both from business and IT-processing perspectives.
