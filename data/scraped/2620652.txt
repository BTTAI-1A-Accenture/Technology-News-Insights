Under pressure from a swarm of activist investors, Salesforce is shedding workers after rampant hiring during the early years of the coronavirus pandemic. The software giant in January announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce and has been carrying out a rolling wave of mass layoffs since, most recently in early March. Salesforce employed nearly 80,000 people as of January 31, according to its latest annual report. In 2021, the company increased its headcount to 73,000 from 57,000. The cuts have affected a broad range of jobs, most recently sales and marketing roles dealing with Salesforce's core products and its acquired companies including Slack, Tableau, and MuleSoft. A group of activist investors, including Elliott Management and Starboard Value, has called on Salesforce to cut costs and increase its profit margins. The company is aggressively pushing forward with that plan, according to CEO Marc Benioff. This means Salesforce will most likely need to continue cutting employee-related expenses. "Improving profitability is our highest priority," Benioff said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. But Salesforce is still hiring. As of Wednesday, the company's website had more than 450 open job listings. Many of the posts were for account executives in the US or for technical support roles in India and Ireland, where hiring is typically cheaper than in the major US tech hubs like San Francisco. Salesforce is required to disclose salary offers in work-visa applications submitted to the US Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Insider reviewed data from the office, which authorizes hiring employees who have relocated to the US from abroad, then publicly releases the data. The following data, which covers the federal 2022 fiscal year, doesn't include stock grants that can significantly increase total compensation, but it is a valuable guide to Salesforce salaries for a variety of positions. Because Salesforce began its cuts in January, the following data provides a snapshot of how the company paid lavish salaries to compete for talent before the tech sector entered a historic downturn. It may not be representative of how Salesforce intends to hire or compensate employees in 2023 and beyond. The roles below are grouped by job category with guidance from the broad categories assigned by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification. Roles are listed below only if there are at least five candidates.When you are done checking out the data below, take a look at Insider's Big Tech salary database to see how much Google, Apple, Uber, Facebook, and other companies pay their workers.
