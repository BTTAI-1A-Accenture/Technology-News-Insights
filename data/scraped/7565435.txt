FOLLOW DEVELOPING TELECOMS  MTN announced it will migrate BSS and OSS applications to Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing platform, a move to tap into machine learning and AI to deliver operational efficiency across the operator’s footprint, starting with Nigeria and South Africa. Migration of the business applications to Azure is currently underway through the establishment of the MTN Group Cloud Centre of Excellence and Project Nephos. A cornerstone of the move will be the migration of MTN's core big data platform EVA, to Azure. The operator said will not only optimise infrastructure but also enable MTN to enhance its common data model, and bridge divisions across network, IT and commercial domains to tap into technology such as machine learning and AI. MTN stated hundreds of employees in Nigeria and South Africa have been trained in Azure technologies and software, with more to be trained across its other units. Professional services company Accenture will support the move by providing technology implementation, integration and support services. The African operator group previously announced it launched a proof of concept for a standalone 5G core using Azure, a move to deploy SA 5G more rapidly. “Our strategic partnership with Microsoft will enable us to transform the way we deliver products and services to our customers. We will bring the power of cloud computing to life driving development and innovation with speed, flexibility and predictable investments and operations. "We remain focused on nurturing the digital skills within MTN and in the societies, we operate in and building digital platforms to drive digital transformation across Africa and the Middle East,” said MTN Group chief information officer Nikos Angelopoulos.
