Rapid progress in technology has significantly enhanced the capabilities of EO/IR sensors. The development of high-performance, low-power electronics has facilitated the creation of smaller and more efficient EO/IR systems. This miniaturization has led to greater portability and expanded the range of military and commercial applications for EO/IR sensors and systems.  Furthermore, advancements in image processing and computer vision algorithms have revolutionized the field. These improvements enable the processing of vast amounts of data captured by EO/IR sensors, resulting in enhanced capabilities for target detection and recognition. A notable example is the Shotover M2 EO/IR system, introduced in July 2022. This highly advanced system combines EO/IR sensors with advanced stabilization technology, allowing it to deliver high-quality imagery even in challenging environments. It has been designed for various applications, including search and rescue, law enforcement, and military operations. Such advancements exemplify how technology is driving the EO/IR market and expanding its application possibilities.  Download Exclusive Sample of Report https://www.visiongain.com/report/top-20-military-eoir-systems-companies-market-2023/#download_sampe_div How has COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on the Top 20 Military Electro Optical and Infrared (EOIR) Systems Companies Report 2023 Market?  Many countries have experienced economic downturns and budgetary constraints due to the pandemic. Governments have had to allocate funds to support healthcare systems, emergency relief measures, and economic recovery efforts. As a result, defense budgets have been impacted, leading to potential cuts or delays in military procurement programs, including those related to EOIR systems.  The pandemic has disrupted global supply chains, causing delays in the production and delivery of EOIR systems. Restrictions on international trade, closure of manufacturing facilities, and logistical challenges have hampered the timely availability of critical components and equipment needed for EOIR systems. This has resulted in supply shortages and delayed project timelines.  How will this Report Benefit you?  Visiongain's 256-page report provides 88 tables and 126 charts/graphs.
