Raghuram Rajan, the renowned economist and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, has come under fire for expressing his unconventional views on India's path to progress. Rajan's statement, in which he questioned the notion of India becoming a superpower, has sparked a heated debate among the public. Responding to a query about his potential role as the country's finance minister or prime minister in the coming decade, Rajan expressed his indifference towards India attaining superpower status. He emphasised that his focus lies on fulfilling the aspirations of every Indian, in alignment with the vision of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. Raghuram Rajan said, "I don't care about India being a superpower, to me that's not the point. It's about what the father of the nation wanted, which means making every Indian happy.”  Rajan wondered how it would be possible to do that.

Social media users denounced Rajan's perspective as extreme and accused him of disregarding the welfare of millions of Indians. Some users argued that achieving superpower status entails reducing poverty, improving healthcare, and enhancing the overall quality of life for the population, which they deemed crucial for the nation's progress. Critics further questioned Rajan's apparent disregard for the contributions of other leaders and freedom fighters in shaping India's destiny, implying that his views were self-centred and dismissive of the collective efforts of the nation. The controversy surrounding Rajan earlier escalated when he published an eight-page note on India's mobile phone exports, drawing the ire of Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.  Chandrasekhar vehemently disputed Rajan's understanding of electronics supply chains, semiconductors and economics itself. He accused the economist of utilising flawed data to arrive at his conclusions and challenged his expertise in the field.
