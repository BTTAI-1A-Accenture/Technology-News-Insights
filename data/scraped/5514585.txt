 By market cap, ExxonMobil is the largest non-government-owned energy company in the world. The company was created in 1999, via a merger of Exxon and Mobil, the successors of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company. With headquarters in Irving, Texas, ExxonMobil’s core business is the exploration, production and trade of crude oil and natural gas as well as manufacturing petroleum products. ExxonMobil has been aggressively spending to finance long-term energy production. While this temporarily hurt its cash flow and led to a cut to its bond rating  in 2020, it’s banking on future oil prices rising for these investments to pay off. Market Cap  $285 billion

 Headquartered out of San Ramon, Calif., Chevron is the second largest energy company in the United States and the third largest in the world. It’s a major producer of oil and gas, a supplier of aviation fuel and owner of over 7,800 Chevron and Texaco retail gas stations. The recent rebound in travel and the global economy has been good for the company’s current prospects; at the same time it’s also investing in future low-carbon energy projects, like renewable jet fuel.

 PetroChina, based in Beijing, is the largest producer and distributor of oil and gas in China and Asia on the whole. The company was the first Chinese stock that Warren Buffett ever bought for Berkshire Hathaway, due to the company’s giant reserves, financial strength and opportunity within the growing Chinese economy. Given that PetroChina’s market cap remains modest compared to the largest American and European energy companies, it could have more room to grow, especially when oil prices and the Chinese economy fully rebound from Covid-19.

 Founded in 1907 with a current headquarters in The Hague, the Netherlands, Shell has gone through a bit of reinvention, moving its home base to the United Kingdom and changing its name to Shell. Its historic core business has been in the production and sale of oil and natural gas as well as manufacturing chemicals. In response to the collapse of energy prices during the Covid-19 pandemic, Royal Dutch Shell cut its dividend, a blow to income investors who held its stock. It also shifted a sizable share of its spending away from capital projects for oil and gas and is now focusing more on the development of renewable energy projects. Market Cap  $166 billion

 Launched in 1924 as an oil and gas company, TotalEnergies is the largest energy company in France. Its current core business focuses on finding, drilling and refining oil and gas. In 2021, however, the company announced that it would like to dramatically shift to cleaner energy sources going forward, with half of its planned capital investment budget over the next four years going toward natural gas and renewable energy. As part of this strategy shift and rebranding, it changed its name from Total to TotalEnergies in May 2021. Market Cap  $130 billion

 ConocoPhillips is an American energy company based in Houston, Texas, that focuses on oil and gas exploration and production (E&P)—the front-end of hydrocarbon production. It is the largest independent E&P company in the world. This energy giant discovers new reserves of oil and gas around the world while also developing novel technologies to extract more energy from existing reserves. The rebound in oil demand has helped its stock performance and future prospects as it can now sell its production for more. Market Cap  $99 billion

 Headquartered in the United Kingdom, BP got its start in 1909 with the discovery of oil in Iran. Since then, it’s become a global company with operations on nearly every continent and the status of one of the leading producers of oil and gas. While hydrocarbons remain BP’s main source of business—one that is doing well considering soaring energy prices—it is in the midst of a major shift to renewable energy production, with the stated goal of being a net-zero carbon producer by 2050.

 Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor operates in more than 30 countries worldwide. The Norwegian government holds a majority 67% stake in Equinor. The company changed its name in 2018, dropping “oil” in an attempt to emphasize its future as a renewable energy provider over its legacy oil and gas business. Equinor runs major offshore oil and gas projects on the continental shelf of Norway and the U.K., as well as fields in Brazil, the United States and Nigeria. It operates several major European pipelines as well, but the company sees its future growth in wind, solar and hydropower projects. Market Cap  $77 billion

Energy sector stocks come from companies focused on the production and supply of energy products to the rest of the economy. They can also include companies providing services and equipment to energy producers. Some of the top categories for energy stocks include: Note: Companies aren’t limited to one category. In fact, it’s common for companies to have hands in many different categories within the energy sector. For example, a company could handle both the extraction, refining and transportation of oil while it also invests in renewable energy projects. Huge markets that are crucial for the global economy. Energy is a major sector of the economy and accounts for trillions of dollars each year. The world economy needs power, creating sustained, long-term demand for the energy sector. Potential for high dividends or company growth. When energy prices go up, energy companies can reap the benefits, like by earning significantly more per barrel of oil, even though their costs stay about the same. This is a chance for them to pay higher dividends to investors or to invest for future growth. Growing global demand. As countries like China and India continue to develop, their need for energy will grow, too. This means there will be plenty of future demand both for existing energy sources like oil and gas as well as growing needs for alternative sources. Diverse range of investments. While oil and natural gas stocks make up the largest share of energy stocks by market cap, they don’t represent the entire sector. By investing broadly in the energy sector, you can also get exposure to green stocks like solar or wind energy companies. Possible rebound after a recession. The energy sector struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, due to less travel and overall demand. Now that the world is beginning to reopen, there could be a new surge in travel, pushing up demand and prices for the best energy stocks. Major environmental concerns. Oil, gas and coal companies are notorious for products that emit greenhouse gases, which worsen global warming. They also have other potential environmental issues, like oil spills. Not only is this an ethical concern, it also makes energy companies vulnerable to costly lawsuits, which can hurt your returns. A volatile market. Energy prices can swing widely and rapidly, depending on the state of the global economy. For example, over the past 10 years the price of crude oil has gone from as high as nearly $110 a barrel to as low as less than $20 a barrel at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The value of energy stocks tends to track energy prices, making these investments more volatile and potentially riskier than stocks in other sectors. Companies need to make big investments. It takes considerable resources to explore new sources of energy, like drilling for new oil wells, not to mention research and development for sustainable energy technology that may not always pan out. These financial drains can potentially harm your long-term returns if enough of them coalesce. Extra regulatory risk. As the world ramps up the fight against global warming, global leaders could enact more regulations limiting the use and production of some sources of energy, like fossil fuels. On the other hand, green companies often rely on government subsidies for development, which don’t always come through, creating political risks on both sides of the energy sector. Innovation and technology may reduce long-term demand. New sources of green energy, like solar, have become dramatically less expensive over the past decade. This is cutting into the demand for coal and could also start hurting demand for oil, gas and other traditional energy sectors, potentially jeopardizing their long-term value. You can buy energy stocks in a taxable brokerage account or tax-advantaged retirement account, like an individual retirement account (IRA). If you don’t already have one of these accounts—or you aren’t satisfied with your current broker—check out Forbes Advisor’s list of the best online brokerages. After careful research into the energy sector, you can purchase individual companies’ stocks using your preferred brokerage platform. Just keep in mind that even in the energy sector, individual stock picking is a risky bet—look at the range of returns in the companies above, and you can see that some have done much better than others. Read More: How To Buy Stocks That’s why experts recommend you take a diversified approach to investing. Rather than investing in just a few stocks, they say you should pick tens, hundreds or even thousands. This allows you to capture the highs of many companies while avoiding getting stuck with the pitfalls of just a few. Over time, this is designed to provide you with steady rising returns. If that sounds like a hassle, you can simplify things by investing in energy sector index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). You can find these using fund screeners at your brokerage. Or consider those that track major energy sector indexes, like the S&P 500 Energy.

			 Via Datalign Advisory Energy stocks have great potential during periods of economic growth. That makes buying energy stocks as the economy transitions from a recession to an expansion can possibly be a good investment.   Recently energy stocks have the highest dividend yield of any stock market sector, as well as the highest free-cash flow. These two statistics are connected: Companies that generate a lot of cash flow can spend a lot on dividends. The best way to invest in renewable energy is to buy mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that build portfolios of green energy companies. There are a wide variety of renewable energy funds managed according to different strategies. Some energy stocks are a good bet during a recession, but not all energy companies do well in a downturn. Utility stocks that distribute electricity and natural gas have steady revenues and cash flow, making them great stocks to own during a recession.   Oil and gas energy stocks often decline in value during a recession, because there is less demand and falling prices for their products during an economic contraction. But not every oil and gas company suffers—midstream stocks, for instance, make money from moving energy products around, and are less impacted by lower energy prices.
