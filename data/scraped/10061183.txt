(Gray News) - Disneyland will be opening a new hotel in 2024. The park announced this week that its Paradise Pier Hotel will officially transform into the Pixar Place Hotel on Jan. 30, 2024. The Pixar hotel will be the first fully Pixar-themed hotel in the nation. “Pixar Place Hotel will evoke the inspiration and humor that goes into every Pixar film while celebrating the artistic process,” the company shared. Disney officials released artist renderings of the hotel’s guest rooms and lobby. Guests will be greeted by a sculpture of the iconic Pixar Lamp balancing atop a ball in the lobby along with spotting some of their beloved Pixar characters in the beginning stages of creation floating from a bright skylight above. “The mobile will depict the beginning stages of Pixar filmmaking when animators create the characters’ designs with their most basic shapes and colors,” officials shared. When it comes to the rooms, Disneyland said they will have a modern feel while being inspired by everything moviegoers have seen in Pixar films. “From pillows inspired by the Pixar Ball to lighting reminiscent of the Pixar Lamp, there will be whimsical nods to the iconic animation studio throughout these comfortable and contemporary accommodations,” Disney officials shared. A new Great Maple restaurant will also be opening, where guests can order such items as Cajun shrimp, buttermilk fried chicken and maple bacon doughnuts. The hotel will have a redesigned pool area. Hotel guests can enjoy the Pixel Pool which will be lined with relaxing lounges, a splash pad and featuring a 186-foot-long water slide. Copyright 2023 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.
