MLB Touching Base is a monthly column highlighting the exciting happenings in baseball beyond the borders of MLB — from international leagues to amateur teams and everything in between. This month’s column will showcase the Dominican Winter League championship, a preview of the upcoming Caribbean Series and the latest updates from the world of the WBC. Hours after Tigres del Licey walked off with a record-setting Game 5 victory in the Dominican Republic Professional Baseball League championship series, their catcher, Jorge Alfaro, popped up at a gas station not far from Estadio Quisqueya. He was not alone. A crowd gathered. Alfaro, who fans have nicknamed “Aquaman” because of his long hair and resemblance to Jason Momoa, was immediately recognizable. With his hulking frame and hair, people knew Alfaro when they saw him, even in street clothes. And especially for what happened next. Advertisement It was well into the early morning in Santo Domingo, but an ad-lib game of stickball broke out between gas pumps. Cars drove in and out, but the game after the game kept going. Esmil Rogers, the ex-Yankees reliever who pitched in relief for Tigres in their run to another title, delivered again in the stickball game. Other players joined in. Fans gathered round, curious customers stopped to watch, too. Phone cameras rolled. Tigres had just won a record 23rd title and with it, Licey moved to the top of the heap in the Dominican. They now hold one more championship in the Dominican Winter League — known by its Spanish acronym, LIDOM — than their rivals, Águilas Cibaeñas. In the long and storied history of baseball in the country, Tigres are the champion of champions. Some Dominican fans understand the New York Yankees as being something like the Tigres of Major League Baseball. And Alfaro is their latest hero. The 29-year-old catcher, a native of Colombia, dominated LIDOM’s round-robin playoffs, hitting .375 through the postseason. In the championship series against Estrellas Orientales, he hit 8-for-19, with two home runs, a double, four RBIs and four runs. He was named the series MVP. In the 10th inning of the deciding match, with a runner on in a 1-1 game, Estrellas’ Ronel Blanco refused to offer Alfaro a strike. His five pitches sailed everywhere except the zone and Alfaro walked to extend the inning. The next batter, Mel Rojas Jr., punched a walk-off single to right field and Licey walked off with another title. Last week, Alfaro reportedly signed a minor-league deal with the Red Sox, joining an unsettled catching corps that may help pave a lane back into the majors. Last season with the Padres, Alfaro hit .246 over 82 games, with seven homers and 40 RBIs. He is a former top prospect for the Rangers and Phillies and before Dominican fans tagged him with a new nickname, Alfaro was known as “El Oso,” the Bear, because of his prodigious power at the plate and behind it with a strong arm. Advertisement Between the Dominican League, gas station stickball, and, soon, spring training, Alfaro’s winter rolls on. If he can crack the Red Sox roster, he will play in his eighth big-league season. And he could become only the latest player to gain momentum in LIDOM on his way to breaking out in MLB. Last season, in Orientales’ run to the LIDOM final, they were led in part by young shortstop Jeremy Peña. Less than a year later, Peña won the World Series MVP award in the Astros’ run to the title. Before Alfaro reports to Fort Myers, Fla., for spring training, he may first fly to Venezuela for more playoffs. As Dominican champions, Tigres earned a spot in the Caribbean Series, the eight-team tournament of champions that starts on Feb. 2. It will be the 65th edition of the Caribbean Series, which first competed in 1949. And, what do you know, Tigres has won the most titles, with 10, followed by, again, Águilas, with six. The teams competing include league champions from the Dominican, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Mexico, Panama, Colombia, Cuba and Curaçao. So far, those teams include Tigres (Dominican), Indios de Mayagüez (Puerto Rico), Vaqueros de Montería (Colombia), Federales de Chiriquí (Panama), Agricultores (Cuba) and WildCats KJ74 (Curaçao). The leagues in Venezuela and Mexico should crown their champions in the next few days. In Venezuela, Tiburones de La Guaira is going against Leones del Caracas in the VPBL championship series. And Game 2 saw a boost of energy. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. signed a late contract to join Tiburones as a designated hitter. And in his first game Tuesday night, Acuña smacked a solo homer to center field in the fourth inning to extend Tiburones’ lead. GÓZATELO RONALDDDDD 🙌🏻🔥 SE VAAA SE VAAAA YYYYYY🦈🥁 VAAAAMOOOOSSSSS @ronaldacunajr24  🎥: @beisbolplaycom #TiburonesReport pic.twitter.com/eAHwVpPJXY — Tiburones Report (@TiburonesReport) January 25, 2023  Leones, though, rallied to win, 8-5, and now hold a two-game lead in the series. And then Acuña immediately bowed out, announcing on Instagram after the game that he was retiring from the Venezuelan league, apparently upset by the welcome the away fans in Caracas extended him and his family. After his home run — and, to be fair, his extended celebration — some fans had to be separated from Acuña’s dad and family, according to reports from the game. Advertisement Acuña, though, was eager to play in his native home. So will we see him play for Venezuela in the coming World Baseball Classic? It appears that the answer is no. Acuña said last week that while he wants to play in the WBC, the Braves have other ideas. “I have always said that I want to represent my country,” Acuña said, “but that’s not a decision I can make. The team, the medics and the staff will take care of that.” As he came off a season-ending knee injury in July of 2021, a right ACL tear, the Braves eased him back into action last year. Of the 115 games he started, Acuña was listed as a designated hitter in 27 of them. Even then, he returned to All-Star status. Acuña’s absence would be a big blow to Venezuela, a team that traditionally stands as one of the favorites to advance out of the WBC’s group stage. Instead, they will have to contend with the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, along with Israel and Nicaragua, for one of two spots in the quarterfinals. As defending WBC champs, Team USA will be among the favorites again in March, but they aren’t coasting. One of the first moves the team made was naming Mike Trout its captain. And the Angels star soon set about recruiting a lineup. “Ever since, it was just a lot of guys that reached out and said, ‘Hey I want to be a part of this.'” Trout said last week. “Everybody wants to be a part of this because it’s going to be something special.” His first call went to Bryce Harper, who was set to play before undergoing elbow surgery this winter, then more calls rolled in. Trout will be joined by an All-Star-studded group, including NL MVP Paul Goldschmidt of the Cardinals. The roster will be finalized by Feb. 7. “The whole reason I signed up: trying to win this thing,” Trout said. “And there’s nothing else. Anything else is a failure.” Advertisement Right-hander Kodai Senga, who in December signed a five-year deal with the Mets, waffled about whether he wanted to pitch for Japan in the WBC. But he did not hide his disappointment in his former team, the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. In a since-deleted Twitter thread earlier this month, Senga said he desired to play in MLB for several years but was held back by Hawks management. They were not willing to allow him to leave, Senga said. He also said he even agreed to certain conditions, like ERA and WAR benchmarks, but was turned down. He stated that he grew to not enjoy the game. It perhaps explains Senga’s enthusiasm upon arriving in New York. “I’m very excited and happy to be in the Big Apple and join such a great team. Let’s go Mets,” he said at an introductory press conference. Japan released its 30-player roster Thursday, a list that includes the Angels’ Shohei Ohtani, Padres pitcher Yu Darvish and Cubs outfielder Seiya Suzuki. And Japan did gain another notable name: Lars Nootbaar. The 25-year-old Cardinals right fielder was born and raised in El Segundo, Calif., but qualifies to play for Japan because his mother is a native of the country. Nootbaar will be the first player in the team’s history to be born outside of Japan. Japan will sport a stacked roster that also includes Masataka Yoshida, the 29-year-old outfielder who in December signed a five-year contract with the Red Sox, and Munetaka Murakami, the 22-year-old Tokyo Yakult Swallows slugger who broke Sadaharu Oh’s single-season homer record last season, with 56. Murakami’s new three-year deal with the Swallows will allow him to move to MLB in 2025. And he’s already stated his preference for a landing spot. “Ideally, I’d like to play for a West Coast team,” Murakami said earlier this month in a televised interview in Japan. “But I’m also interested in the New York Yankees.” Advertisement They were playing stickball in Santo Domingo the other night, but the traditional street game in the Dominican Republic is called La Plaquita, which means “little plate.” (You may be familiar with this if you read the new rules proposals Levi Weaver and I did earlier this month.) Kids (or adults, whoever) make home plate out of a crimped license plate (or folded cardboard, whatever works) that is propped up on an edge behind the batter. The pitcher’s job is to knock over la plaquita. The batter’s job is to protect la plaquita by hitting the ball. Bounced pitches are routine. This is the game Vladimir Guerrero Sr., played as a kid to learn his — how should we say — aggressive approach to a wide strike zone. A few more updates from around the world of baseball: • South Korea’s WBC roster appears to be set, after the additions of Cardinals second baseman Tommy Edman, Pirates first baseman Ji-Man Choi and Padres infielder Ha-Seong Kim. • It required MLB to lobby for a license from the U.S. government, but Cuban major-leaguers who live stateside will be allowed to play for Cuba in the WBC. On Thursday, Cuba released its roster and third baseman Yoan Moncada and center fielder Luis Robert of the White Sox are the only current major leaguers included. • Longtime Astros utilityman Marwin Gonzalez, who played with the Yankees last season, will move to Osaka after signing a one-year deal with the Orix Buffaloes of NPB. • Adam McKillican is a world traveler. The native of Canada is a right-hander in the Rockies organization who played last season in High-A Spokane and this winter for the Adelaide Giants in Australia. • Thunder Bay, Ontario will host the 2024 Women’s Baseball World Cup finals. • And finally, the Reds this month signed lefty Dominic Scheffler when the international free agency period opened. At 6-foot-4, he throws a 94-95 mph fastball. And if Scheffler can reach the major leagues, he would become just the second player in MLB’s history to be born in Switzerland. As it stands, the only Swiss-born player in the majors was Otto Hess, who played for the Cleveland Naps and Boston Braves in the early 1900s.
