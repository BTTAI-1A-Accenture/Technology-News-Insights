Eventually, we'll arrive at Domingo German, who may be literally perfect, but only in this one way: He went a full nine innings without allowing a baserunner Wednesday. Whoop-de. I don't want to say it's not a big deal. He's only the 24th pitcher in major-league history to do it and the first since Felix Hernandez in 2012. But it's not like the list is a who's who of aces. Some of the others to accomplish the feat in the not-so-distant past include Philip Humber and Dallas Braden. And also Armando Galarraga, though he didn't get credit for his. So from a historical perspective, yes, it's a big huge deal. From German's personal perspective, of course it's a big deal. He gets a photographic moment and a story to pass down through the generations. But I'm in the forecasting business, OK? And from that perspective, I'm obligated to point out how imperfect German is. In the two starts leading up to this one, he had allowed 15 earned runs over 5 1/3 innings. Yikes. Â© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.
