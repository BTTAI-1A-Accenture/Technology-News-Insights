Meanwhile, responding to Gehlotâs tweet, the PMO tweeted, âIn accordance with protocol, you have been duly invited and your speech was also slotted. But, your office said you will not be able to join.â âDuring PMâs previous visits as well you have always been invited and you have also graced those programmes with your presence. You are most welcome to join todayâs programme. Your name is very much there on the plaque of the development works as well. Unless you have any physical discomfort owing to your recent injury, your presence will be deeply valued,â the PMO added. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the ‘red diary’ will reveal secrets that would ruin Congress in the upcoming polls. Addressing a rally at Sikar in Rajasthan, the Prime Minister said that the Congress has only runÂ âLoot ki dukaanâÂ andÂ âJhooth ka bazaarâÂ in Rajasthan in the name of running government. The âred diaryâ is a fresh product of the Congressâ âloot ki dukanâ. It is said that the âdark deedsâ of the Congress are recorded in the diary, which will defeat the party in elections in the state, Modi said. The âred diaryâ was recently produced by the now-dismissed Congress leader Rajendra Gudha in the state assembly. He claimed the diary contained the details of the alleged irregular financial transactions of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Find us on YouTube is on YouTube Copyright @ 2024.
