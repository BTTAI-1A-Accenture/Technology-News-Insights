or Remember me or TORONTO, Nov. 14, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clairvest Group Inc. (TSX: CVG) today reported results for the fiscal 2023 second quarter and six months ended September 30, 2022 and material events subsequent to quarter end. (All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated) Highlights Clairvest’s book value was $1,194.2 million or $79.48 per share as at September 30, 2022, compared with $1,156.0 million or $76.80 per share as at June 30, 2022. The increase in book value for the quarter was attributable to net income for the quarter of $40.1 million, or $2.66 per share. The net increase arose from an increase in the valuation of Clairvest’s private equity investment portfolio. In July 2022, Clairvest together with CEP VI made a US$40.0 million equity investment in Star Waste, which was previously announced in the first quarter press release. Clairvest’s portion of the investment was US$10.8 million (C$14.2 million). In July 2022, and as previously announced in the first quarter press release, Clairvest and CEP V completed the partial realization of Meriplex. At closing, Clairvest and CEP V received cash proceeds totaling US$169.1 million while continuing to own approximately 18% of Meriplex. Clairvest’s portion of the cash proceeds was US$56.7 million and it retained a 5.5% ownership interest in Meriplex. In August 2022, and as previously announced in the first quarter press release, NovaSource Power Services completed a US$100 million equity raise where a third-party investor acquired a minority ownership in the company. Subsequent to the transaction, NovaSource Power Services repaid the bridge loans previously advanced by Clairvest and CEP VI. In September 2022, Clairvest and CEP VI made a $100 million minority equity investment to support the merger and recapitalization of Alberta-based Roger Insurance and British Columbia-based CapriCMW forming a combined entity operating as Acera Insurance. Clairvest’s portion of the investment was $27.1 million. Subsequent to quarter end, Top Aces completed an equity raise from new and existing investors. As part of this transaction, Clairvest made an incremental $17.9 million equity investment in Top Aces. As at September 30, 2022, Clairvest had US$27.6 million in loans advanced to Top Aces which was repaid in full in conjunction with the equity raise. “Over the quarter, there have been positive developments both in our portfolio and on the capital deployment front. Most notably, we are thrilled to partner with over 350 employee owners and support Acera Insurance on its path to become the largest independent Canadian insurance brokerage of choice,” said Ken Rotman, CEO of Clairvest. “Despite the macroeconomic backdrop, our portfolio companies in aggregate continue to demonstrate strong financial performance. We will continue to stay disciplined in our underwriting process and capitalize on unique opportunities to back owner-operators.”
