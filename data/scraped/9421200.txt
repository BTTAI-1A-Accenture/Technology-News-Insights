Want to up your putt-putt game? Daytona Beach is one of 13 places planned for a PopStroke golf center, a company owned in part by Tiger Woods, the company has announced. The location has not been announced, but they're driving for next year. This fast-growing family golf entertainment chain only begins with mini-golf. There is also a full-service restaurant, craft kitchens, outdoor dining areas, outdoor games, an ice cream parlor and a self-contained playground next to a sports bar so you can watch the kids without missing the game. But the jewels of the venue are the two upscale, curated putting courses designed by Woods and his TGR Design team, with rolling greens and scaled-down sandtraps to bring the Masters to your family outing. Tiny green jackets not included. He's a co-owner. After the first PopStroke location opened in Port St. Lucie in 2019 Woods was brought on as a co-owner. Woods' TGR Design team redid the Port St. Lucie course and went on to design all the new ones.  Need a break?

"PopStroke continues to use golf to bring families and friends together in a fun, welcoming environment,” said Woods. “I am excited to see PopStroke expanding into these new cities.” 'Putt-putt golf on steroids':How Tuscaloosa landed Tiger Woods' PopStroke PopStroke partner:PopStroke, Tiger Woods welcome TaylorMade with deal pushing company value to $650 million The Jupiter-based business was founded by former Wall Street banker Greg Bartoli in 2017. PopStroke is TopGolf for the family. TopGolf offers the dining, drinking and golf experience, but caters more to golfers and casual players. It's a full-swing experience with a massive driving range and plenty of mini-games to interest even non-golfers. TopGolf is where you go with your buddies, your spouse, or on a date (if they're into it). PopStroke takes mini-golf and elevates it to new heights. The Woods-designed course gets you away from the standard wood-framed, green-carpeted holes of your childhood and puts you on synthetic turf with realistic holes, sand bunkers and simulated areas of rough. PopStroke is for family night. Or day. Both places lean heavily into technology to make things interesting. With TopGolf, each ball is electronically tracked so you, your friends and even a trainer, if you wish, can see how you're doing on big screens in real time. PopStroke has an app you can use to keep the group score, order food and drinks to be delivered right to you, anywhere on the course, and more. And they don't skimp on the gear. You can bring your own clubs, or TopGolf offers the latest Callaway golf clubs. (Originally an investor, Top Golf was purchased by Calloway in 2020.) PopStroke offers TaylorMade rental putters and you get a special edition TaylorMade golf ball to use and then take home as a keepsake. The rates change, from location to location, and not all options are available at every PopStroke. Generally speaking: IDs are required for military and students. Pricey? Bartoli thinks it's worth it. "I think people still want to have family entertainment and do things together," he said. "And our ability to provide an experience for all ages sets us apart." The first one was in Port St. Lucie. Since then, the company has opened locations in Sarasota, Fort Myers, Orlando and Tampa/Wesley Chapel. There also are PopStrokes in Glendale, Arizona, and Houston/Katy, Texas. Three more are under construction in Scottsdale, Delray Beach, and Tuscaloosa, and the Las Vegas location is expected to break ground in May, according to a press release. All are expected to open this year. More have been announced for 2024 including Daytona Beach, Wellington, another in Orlando and West Palm Beach. Around the country, next year will see PopStrokes in Nashville, San Antonio, Myrtle Beach, North Dallas, and College Station. "We are seeing huge consumer demand to bring our immersive experience into new cities. PopStroke was created to bring people together across all ages and skill levels through the game of golf. We are thrilled to expand our reach and share the PopStroke experience with new guests," Bartoli said.
