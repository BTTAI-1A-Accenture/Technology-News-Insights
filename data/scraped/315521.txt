 Now  57  Sun  77  Mon  75 by The National Desk TOPICS: WASHINGTON (TND) — The Ford executive chair calls on auto workers to end the auto workers strike.  Former White House Economic Advisor Steve Moore joined The National Desk’s Dee Dee Gatton to discuss the issue. “This strike has gone on for several months, and there's no question that its costing Ford and GM a lot of money in terms of the reduction and production of new cars,” he said. “Meanwhile, you have a situation where the auto companies are really struggling in power because they've invested very, very heavily, billions and billions of dollars in electric vehicles. Americans are buying those electric vehicles nearly at the pace that the companies had thought and that means they're losing money.” Ford's Executive Chairman Bill Ford called for an end of the strike saying that could cost the company the ability to invest in the future. This comes a month after autoworkers walked off the job initiating the start of the strike. Moore says if these companies continue to lose money, the workers will not have a job to return to. “These auto workers need to be attentive to what's happening to the company that they work for. If it's not a profitable company, they're going to have to eventually layoff people,” Moore said. “So it's a very precarious situation for both to work the tens of thousands of workers that are on strike, but also the company and its investors as well.”
