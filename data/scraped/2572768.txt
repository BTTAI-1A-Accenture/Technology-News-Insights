 Now that the 2023 Lantern Rite kicked off in Genshin Impact, Marco “Meatball” Domenico confirmed he voices a character named Dvorak in the game. Once someone takes and begins the “A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune” questline, they’ll encounter Dvorak and Yaoyao outside Qingce. Here’s Marco Meatball’s official announcement. Dvorak is an NPC musician from Fontaine, the next region heading to Genshin Impact. He’s looking to learn the truth about an encounter his ancestor had, while also trying to bring the Iridescence Tour music festival to other regions. With the Lantern Rite kicking off, he gets a chance to further both goals.  Wow. While you're walking around Liyue and the Lantern Rite Festival, you'll meet Dvorak, a conductor and musician from Fontaine. I can't believe me: an opera singer for a decade, gets to play a musician in @GenshinImpact thank you to @ChrisFaiella and @FormosaInteract . pic.twitter.com/lR9eoJw2tx — MarcoMeatball (@Marcodmeatball) January 19, 2023   Here’s a video in which Marco Meatball goes over his Genshin Impact appearance.
