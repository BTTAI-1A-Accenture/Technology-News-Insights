SALT LAKE CITY — Florida football starting center Kingsley Eguakun in out for tonight's game at No. 14 Utah. Eguakun emerged from the tunnel pregame in shorts and a walking boot on his right leg. The injury ends a string of 26 straight starts over the past two seasons for the 6-foot-5, 300-pound Eguakun for the Florida Gators. He was named to the Rimington Award watch list over the offseason, given to the nation's top center. Last season, Eguakun started all 13 games for an offensive line that blocked the run game to 5.5 yards per carry, which ranked fourth in program history and sixth in the FBS. In addition, UF's 17 sacks allowed in 2022 tied for the 27th-fewest in the Power Five and fourth in the SEC.  How to watch:What channel is Florida vs. Utah on today?
