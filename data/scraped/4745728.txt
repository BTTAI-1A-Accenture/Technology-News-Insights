Published on By Austin Faani, popular Nigerian filmmaker and actress, Chacha Ekeâs husband says religion has done more harm than good in Africa. Faani stated this while revealing some of the sacrifices he made when his wife was mentally ill. Speaking at the Meticulous People Foundation Outreach, a foundation that deals with mental illness, owned by Chacha, Faani recounted how a pastor deceived him into sacrificing goats in a bid to heal his wife. Sharing the video on her Instagram page, Chacha Eke wrote: “The universe knew I would need ‘saving’ and so they sent ‘Austin Faani’ my way.” He said: “I’m a very religious person but I believe religion has done more harm to Africans than anything else. “In November 2012, I took her to a church because I told the pastor that my father-in-law killed a lot of cows for her, he said I should kill something for her. So I ran to Abraka market and bought a big goat for her but at the end of the day, the same thing kept happening to her.” Video:     A post shared by ChaCha Eke Faani (@chachaekefaani)  âDude was ready to sacrifice it all for meâ – Tonto Dikeh sad over Solidstarâs mental health Insecurity: Kate Henshaw urges FG to scrap NYSC ‘I’m frontman of Africaâs most successful band’ – Seun Kuti boasts Launch of vaccine initiative in Paris missed opportunity for Africa- Amref Africa can help the rest of the world – Tinubu ‘Women’ re not treated properly in Africa’ – Joeboy Airlines’ cargo demand: Africa-Asia market outperforms North America, Middle East in April 2024 Nigeria regains position as largest crude oil producer in Africa – OPEC Copyright Â© Daily Post Media Ltd
