    Breaking down the most popular channels on live streaming platforms like YouTube TV, Hulu Live and Fubo.
   If you're thinking about leaving cable behind, a live TV streaming service may be a good option for you. Contract-free pricing, wide channel selections and the ability to watch on multiple devices are all factors that can make these services competitive compared to traditional TV or cable. You can stream sports, premium channels or prime-time TV, and not only do these platforms offer a broader lineup of channels compared with antennas, but they also provide the convenience of watching on your computer or mobile device.  Right now, there are six main services to pick from (we're not including smaller ones): YouTube TV, Hulu Plus Live TV, Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, Fubo and Philo. But what really counts is the variety of channels they offer, right? We've analyzed their primary channel lineups to help you decide which one may fit your needs.

All of them offer different lineups of channels for various prices.          Below you'll find a chart that shows the top 100 channels across all six services, but note that not each service has a worthy 100. There are actually seven listed because Sling TV has two different "base" tiers, Orange and Blue. And if you're wondering, I chose which "top" channels made the cut. Sorry, AXS TV, Discovery Life, GSN and Universal HD. Remember that Philo now offers a new package for newcomers that costs $28 per month and bundles in AMC Plus. If you're a current customer, you can keep your current plan and still pay $25.  Fubo now offers the YES Network at no extra charge for baseball. And Hulu's live TV offering now includes the MLB Network. We'll also note Fubo's big loss of Warner Bros. Discovery channels such as Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, HGTV, Food Network, OWN, TLC, Magnolia Network and Cartoon Network may make it less appealing. But if you want to get rid of cable, there are numerous live TV streaming choices available. Sling TV's basic packages are $40 in most cities. But costs continue to go up. Fubo's price for its basic plan is $80, which is the same price as DirecTV Stream's base plan. YouTube TV costs $73 per month, and Hulu's live offering is currently $77. Beware that Hulu plus Live TV will go up in price in October, making its basic package the most expensive at $83 per month.  Those changes are reflected in the chart below where applicable.    Some more stuff to know about the chart:           A series of price hikes has brought a number of additional channels to Hulu, including PBS and access to Disney Plus and ESPN Plus, at a $77 price tag. Its channel selection isn't as robust as YouTube TV, yet it's Hulu's significant catalog of on-demand content which sets it apart. Exclusive titles such as Shōgun, The Bear and Only Murders in the Building give it a content advantage no other service can match.  Live TV subscribers also receive unlimited DVR that includes fast-forwarding and on-demand playback -- at no additional cost. It's a move that has aligned Hulu with its competitors in terms of features, but the channel lineup may still be a deciding factor. It's $4 more than YouTube TV which has more channels, but the access to Disney Plus and ESPN Plus may make it a more appealing choice for you. Read our Hulu Plus Live TV review. With an excellent channel selection, easy-to-use interface and best-in-class cloud DVR, the $73 per month YouTube TV is one of the best cable TV replacements. It offers a $20 4K upgrade, but the downside is there isn't much to watch at present unless you watch select channels. If you don't mind paying a bit more than the Sling TVs of the world, or want to watch live NBA games, YouTube TV offers a high standard of live TV streaming. Read our YouTube TV review. If you want to save a little money and don't mind missing out on local channels, Sling TV is the best of the budget services. Its Orange and Blue packages start at $40 per month, and you can combine them for a monthly rate of $55 ($60 in some regions). The Orange option nets you one stream, while Blue gives you three. It's not as comprehensive or as easy to navigate as YouTube, but with a bit of work, including adding an antenna or an AirTV 2 DVR, it's an unbeatable value. We'll also add that the service offers local channels such as ABC and CBS in some regions where the monthly rate is $45. Read our Sling TV review. DirecTV Stream is tied with Fubo as the most expensive, and its stiffest competition is still Hulu Plus Live TV and YouTube TV. The service does have its pluses, though -- for example, it includes the flipper-friendly ability to swipe left and right to change channels. Additionally, it includes some channels some other services can't, including nearly 250 PBS stations nationwide. The $80 Entertainment package may suit your needs with its 75-plus channels. But for cord-cutters who want to follow their local NBA or MLB team, DirecTV Stream's $109 Choice package is our live TV streaming pick because it has access to more regional sports networks than the competition. Nonetheless, you'll want to make sure your channel is included here, and not available on one of our preferred picks, before you pony up. Read our DirecTV Stream review. There's a lot to like about Fubo -- it offers a wide selection of channels and its sports focus makes it especially attractive to soccer fans or NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. It's also a great choice for NFL fans, since it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, that offer NFL Network and optional RedZone. As of February 2024, Fubo is charging more for its service and access to Bally Sports RSNs. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Warner Bros. Discovery networks, including HGTV, Food Network, Cartoon Network, CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content, in particular NBA, NHL and MLB. Those missing channels, and the $80 price tag, makes it less attractive than YouTube TV for most viewers. Read our Fubo review. Philo raised its price from $25 to $28 for new subscribers and added an AMC Plus bundle, and it's still a cheap live TV streaming service with a variety of channels. But it lacks sports channels, local stations and big-name news networks -- although Cheddar and BBC news are available. Philo offers bread-and-butter cable staples like Comedy Channel, Nickelodeon and Magnolia Network, and specializes in lifestyle and reality programming. It's also one of the cheapest live services that streams Paramount, home of Yellowstone, and it includes a cloud DVR and optional add-ons from Epix and Starz. We think most people are better off paying another $12 for Sling TV's superior service, but if Philo has every channel you want, it's a decent deal. Read our Philo review.
