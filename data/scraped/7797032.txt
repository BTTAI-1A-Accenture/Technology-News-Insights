Regarding the Orsted Ocean Wind I energy project off the New Jersey coast: Do you find it shocking that a foreign company would be given federal tax credits to develop a wind farm to produce clean energy? Calm yourself. Oil and gas companies have been given 100 percent credits for drilling costs for decades. Although the direct costs of drilling equipment are depreciated over seven years, certain operating costs are 100 percent deductible over the life of a project. Orsted may be registered as a Danish corporation, but it is owned by shareholders who can be from anywhere. When America was building its railroads 200 years ago, many of the investors and buyers of railroad bonds were European.
