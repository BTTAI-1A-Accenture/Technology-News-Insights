 Greetings Friends,  Vote with your wallet to watch where your money goes . . . unbiased education wins! To contribute to science visit iNaturalist!  All aboard The Butterfly Bus ¬© as we journey for change! Commit to discovering fascinating facts about our natural world. Our storu starts with the lifestyle of Danaus plexippus as it depends on the oyamel (Abies religiosa) or sacred fir tree. The Sierra Madre Mountains of central Mexico the destination . . .  Monarchs shelter in place from December to March yearly - clinging to trees for protection from the cold and rainy seasons. Every Spring, the Eastern Monarch butterfly relies on the intelligent design of its wings to successfully complete an epic journey northeast of Mexico. Using a solar compass; an annual clock (in their antennae) AND while gliding on air currents, millions of these strong flyers depart from Angangueo, Michoac√°n. Before the colony dies eggs are laid to offer us the NXT GEN of flying fertilizers. This new generation hatches; matures, and continues to fly north - repeating this life cycle up to four times. Allowing the great and great-grandchildren of the original colony to eco-tour seasonal U.S. destinations.  We specialize in establishing innovative pathways to progress without punishment towards positive change. Science plays a lead role in our diplomacy by clustering academic interest areas of science, art, and mathematics. Biological and geological aspects of our practice are explored through a pro-social learning lens. Your support is requested to open the door of activity! The essence of your contribution is to cultivate stewards for healthy ecosystems.  According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the monarch has been considered an endangered species. The monarch butterfly has been placed on the IUCN‚Äôs ‚Äúred list‚Äù of threatened species and is also considered a candidate for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Endangered Species Act.  A 2011 survey found that 6.4 million Florida residents and nonresidents, 16 years old and older participated in some sort of wildlife-recreation activity (i.e., fishing, hunting, or wildlife watching)and spent $9.0 billion (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Nearly half of Americans participated in at least one outdoor recreation activity in 2015, which equates to 142.4 million participants, who went on almost 12 billion outdoor outings (The Outdoor Foundation 2016). Americans spend $887 billion annually participating in outdoor recreation supporting 7.6 million American jobs (Outdoor Industry Association 2017). About 20% of total international travel focuses on nature as an attraction (UNWTO 2014). Documenting citizen science centers our work around the identification and exploration of coastal regions. We aim to offer authentic experiences in the great outdoors! Serving biodiversity hotspots across Canada and the United Kingdom; North, Central, South America, and outlying island territories. Activities are designed for both upland and along the coast, seaside, seacoast, and seashore; on international waters and oceans. Offering a deep dive into behaviorism and constructivism via study of threatened and endangered people, places, AND living organisms!  https://www.iNaturalist.org/projects/red-list-butterfly-study Copyright ¬© 2023 Certified Naturalist.
