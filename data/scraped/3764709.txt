Molly RingwaldÂ wouldn't forget about the Brat Pack.Â  TheÂ "The Breakfast Club"Â actress recentlyÂ had a reunion with costarÂ Ally SheedyÂ on the set ofÂ Freeform'sÂ "Single Drunk Female." But it wasn't just a set visit for these two stars â€” Ringwald will beÂ guest starring in a season two episode of the comedy, which follows Samantha Fink (Sofia Black-D'Elia), a 20-something alcoholicÂ who'sÂ forced to move back in with overbearing mother Carol (Sheedy) in order to sober up and avoid jail time.

"Acting with Ally Sheedy is like being with a member of my family," RingwaldÂ toldÂ Entertainment WeeklyÂ Dec. 17.Â "We have so much history we barely need to even speak. The challenge is trying not to cry. Getting to be on set with her again was one of the best parts of my year."

I delight in her company so working on our episode together was a joy. And I think she's brilliantâ€¦ so there's that! Very grateful for her work on our show." Ringwald will be playing Carol's sister-in-law Alice who, according toÂ EW, is Sam's "perfect" favorite aunt. Alice always knows how to do thingsÂ justÂ a bit better than Carol, which, of course, gets under Carol's skin.  But the rivalry doesn't continue off-set. On Dec. 4, Ringwald posted a sweet snap of her and SheedyÂ hugging at an end-of-year dinner.Â  A post shared by Molly RingwaldğŸ§¿ (@mollyringwald) "Early Christmas present-dinner," sheÂ captioned the pic.
