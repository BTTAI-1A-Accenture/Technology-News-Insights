     Super Bowl LVII is set. The final game of the 2022-23 season will be played between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs after both teams won their respective conference title games on Jan. 29. The Eagles defeated the San Francisco 49ers in a 31-7 blowout. The 49ers lost Brock Purdy early and rushing touchdowns from Jalen Hurts, Miles Sanders and Boston Scott pushed the Eagles past one of the best defenses in football. San Francisco never really got going after the Purdy injury. The Chiefs edged the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20. Patrick Mahomes was great even with a high-ankle sprain. His gallop at the end of the game, which drew a penalty, helped set up Harrison Butker’s game-winning field goal. Kansas City was able to do enough to keep Joe Burrow at bay. The matchup will feature the two best teams in the league. Both teams earned first-round byes. However, now the real challenges will begin. How will Mahomes’ ankle heal before the game? Will the Chiefs’ offensive line be able to hold the pass rush? Will Hurts be able to replicate his performance in the biggest game of his career?
