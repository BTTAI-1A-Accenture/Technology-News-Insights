Designed for manufacturing, engineering, utility, physical security, facility management, contracting and construction sectors, SpotCast enables instructional and safety videos to be embedded on QR Code stickers. SaferMe,  a workforce safety company, has announced the launch of SpotCast, a new  video sticker platform. SpotCast enables instructional and safety videos to be embedded on QR Code stickers. The sticker is placed on any piece  of equipment, and employees simply scan it with their smartphone or tablet and  watch the embedded video. No sign-up is required.   SpotCast  solves the challenge of delivering instructional videos to  employees, at the right time and in the right place. Markets for the product  include manufacturing, engineering, utility, physical security, facility  management, contracting and construction sectors. “The  type of instructions that employees really require involves more than just  reading a manual, or listening to a verbal instruction,” says Clint Van  Marrewijk, CEO and founder of SaferMe. “Doing  a job for the first time can be difficult, or dangerous, or both. Next to  in-person training, video is the best instructional medium by far, for a  business environment. Training managers can’t be right next to someone all the  time, to show employees exactly what to do. That’s where video comes in.” SpotCast  is already delivering results in Europe and New Zealand, where it is being used  to create training and risk management videos that communicate ‘how  to’ messages. Content  creators require minimal training on how to use the platform. The stickers that are unique to each company are  ordered from SaferMe, and once the SpotCast stickers arrive, the user follows  a three-step process: 1.     The sticker is placed on any piece of equipment or in  any preferred location. 2.      The QR Code sticker is then scanned, and the user is  prompted to record their video. 3.      The video is uploaded to the QR Code and becomes  active. The next time someone scans the SpotCast sticker, the recorded training  video will play on the users’ phone.   SpotCast  can be updated with new videos at any time, and the stickers are durable,  waterproof, sunproof and tear-proof.
