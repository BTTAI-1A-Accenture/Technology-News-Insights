Crisis lines are available for anyone experiencing mental health-related distress, whether that is thoughts of suicide, a mental health or substance use crisis, or any other kind of emotional distress. The use of a crisis line is different from 911 in that 911 focuses on dispatching emergency medical services, or the fire or police departments as needed, often in cases of imminent danger. Hospice of the Valley operates grief support groups that are both in person and virtual and don't cost anything.
