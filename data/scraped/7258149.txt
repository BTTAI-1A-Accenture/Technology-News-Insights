Fox News Digital spoke with founder and dog trainer Brooke Corson about Ike’s responsibilities as a facility dog. "He’ll not only help boost morale, he’s also another modality for improving mental health on the ship," she said. The program from Mutts With A Mission is "very new." Ike will work alongside his handler to provide services such as alerting to the anxiety of others and responding to tragedies onboard in one-on-one cases, according to Corson.

"We really want to make sure they get the job they’re best at and [where] they’re happiest." It’s clear that Ike "loves being aboard the Wasp," Corson shared. "He loves the energy of the ship.
