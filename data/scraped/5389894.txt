First Team Club Tickets & Museum Download the official FC Barcelona App Barça got the job done against Aalborg of Denmark in a tight game in which the home side found their touch towards the end. Dika Mem led the scoring with 9 and Barça continue unbeaten with 9 wins and a draw The game was preceded by a show of support for Aitor Ariño who has undergone surgery and is likely to be out for some time. Barça were by no means flowing early on, but especially thanks to goal from Wanne and saves from Nielsen they had a one-goal lead on the quarter hour. But neither side could amass any kind of meaningful lead, with  Pálmarsson, Hoxer Hangaard and goalkeeper Aggefors among the standout players for the visitors The difference was rarely any bigger than one goal, and the biggest game.changer seemed to the decision to send Pérez de Vargas into the Barça goal. The replacement was inspired and at last we got to see a sizeable blaugrana lead. At 27-24, it looked like Barça had finally found a way, and thankfully that did indeed prove to be the case.
