The following year, a 16-year-old Pittsburg girl was shot and killed at that location, allegedly by her boyfriend, authorities said.Last year, four people were arrested and charged with stripping a patron nude and torturing him during a dispute inside an illegal casino. In that case, the evidence included surveillance camera footage set up within the casino, ostensibly for patrons’ protection, court records show.
