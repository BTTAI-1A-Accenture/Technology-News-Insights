Westpac New Zealand (Westpac NZ)[i]
has reported a 33% fall in net profit[ii]
for the six months ended 31 March 2023, compared with the
same period last year, but says its underlying performance
has been stable.Last year’s one-off sale of Westpac
Life[iii]
not being repeated and a lift in impairment provisions,
including an overlay for financial impacts of severe weather
in the North Island, had contributed to the decrease in net
profit.Excluding the sale of Westpac Life and other
notable items, net profit was down 15%, compared with the
same period last year.Chief Executive Catherine
McGrath said Westpac NZ had made good progress supporting
customers’ home ownership, business growth and savings
aspirations during the reporting period. It had also offered
significant support to customers affected by Cyclone
Gabrielle and flooding.“We’ve seen some really
positive momentum during the reporting period.“More
New Zealanders have chosen to become Westpac customers, and
we have grown mortgage lending by 5%, business lending by 4%
and deposits by 2%.“We’re in a stable and
well-capitalised position and are well-placed to support our
customers.”



While Westpac NZ had delivered a stable
performance during the half year period, the weakening
economic cycle and impact of severe weather had been felt in
the financial result.Ms McGrath said there was not
yet clarity about several key issues for homeowners and
businesses severely impacted by Cyclone Gabrielle and
flooding in the North Island.“As soon as the
outlook is clearer, we will be able to work with our
customers to agree the best way we can support them over the
longer term. Due to the current uncertainty, we have made a
weather event impairment overlay.”She said another
factor within the $154 million impairment charge was the
deteriorating economic outlook impacting households and
businesses.“Our economists are forecasting a
recession this year. The global outlook remains uncertain
and funding markets are moving around. In addition,
inflation and consumer spending remain high, increasing the
risks of a hard landing.“The rising cost of living
has squeezed households and interest rates have risen
quickly. While we are not currently seeing significant
numbers of customers requiring hardship assistance, demand
is slowly increasing, and we expect it to rise further as
the outlook worsens.”Customer supportMs
McGrath said Westpac NZ had introduced new programmes to
identify and contact customers who may need extra
support.Employees had begun proactively calling
600 customers per month, who had been identified as being at
higher risk of encountering financial stress.The
bank was writing to about 7,000 customers per month who were
coming off a fixed-rate home loan to let them know they
could lock in a new rate 60 days before expiry, to give them
certainty about repayments.About 1,000 of those
home loan customers facing the largest increases in
repayments or thought to need extra guidance were receiving
follow-up phone calls.Ms McGrath said the
majority of New Zealand household and business customers
were generally coping well and encouraged anyone feeling
under strain to reach out to Westpac NZ for
help.“We recognise cashflows are getting tighter.
Last month we led the market in setting a special 3-year
fixed mortgage rate of 5.99% for eligible customers, so that
borrowers could choose a competitive rate that also provided
certainty around repayments.”Cyclone & flood
assistanceMs McGrath said Westpac NZ’s teams had
worked hard to provide assistance to customers affected by
flooding and Cyclone Gabrielle.“We’ve already
paid more than $3.75 million[iv]
in direct financial support to customers and communities
that felt the force of the summer’s severe weather,
including cash grants of $2,500 to affected business
customers. We also provided a range of interest-free lending
support to eligible businesses and
households.“Businesses told us the immediate cash
grants provided a kickstart to help them through a difficult
time, with many struggling with issues like damage to
premises, loss of stock and booking
cancellations.“We’ve paid out most of our $1
million pool of targeted donations to a range of support
organisations helping their communities, including iwi,
rural support trusts and mayoral relief funds, with
remaining funds to be paid in coming months.“We
were also the first major bank to announce that temporary
overdrafts for eligible households, enabled through a
Government regulatory exemption[v],
would be offered interest-free.”Key
Financials(All comparisons are for the six months

much of the extra spending has gone on risk, regulatory and
technology projects that will set us up strongly to deliver
for customers in coming years,” said Ms
McGrath.Funds under management in the Westpac
KiwiSaver Scheme[vi]
increased 3% year-on-year, to $9.6 billion as at 31 March
2023. The average Westpac KiwiSaver Scheme balance increased
3% over the same period to $22,647.Together
GreaterMs McGrath said Westpac NZ remained focussed
on addressing the big challenges facing New
Zealand.“Our release in April[vii]
of the Westpac NZ Access to Banking in Aotearoa
Report shone a light on the challenges faced by some New
Zealanders in getting a bank account.“Banks have a
part to play in making access easier. One highlight has been
working with Oranga Tamariki and VOYCE-Whakarongo Mai
towards making it easier for youths in care to sign up for
an account.“This follows work we have done with the
Department of Corrections to make it easier for prisoners
nearing release to get a bank account.”Ms McGrath
said the severity of this year’s storms had driven home
the need to respond to climate change.“Our Westpac
Warm Up loan allows mortgage holders to borrow up to $40,000
interest-free over five years to make their home warmer,
drier and more energy efficient. It’s proved popular with
$73 million lent to more than 6,000 customers.“We
also worked with Lincoln University[viii]
to release a major new report and information fact sheets
late last year to help farmers and growers understand the
impact of climate change, so they can plan for the
future.“We are preparing to roll out a Sustainable
Agribusiness Loan following an earlier pilot of this
initiative.“These areas of work will equip our
agribusiness customers to make practical decisions that
factor in the growing impact of climate change.”Ms
McGrath said her team was also proud it had launched a new
partnership with NZ Landcare Trust to improve water quality,
and had also significantly increased support for Community
Law Centres o Aotearoa.[i]

A model designed to give an early warning of a downturn in the economy is suggesting continued weakening in the labour market with an unemployment rate that may have already reached 4.8 per cent. In New Zealand while RTD sales volumes continued to trend down, total spirit and spirit-based drink volumes passed that of wine in 2023. 50% of spirits sold globally in 2022 were at premium level or above, reflecting consumers’ growing preference to drink less and drink better.

Te Papa is ensuring New Zealanders will always be able to come through its doors for free, by introducing an entry fee for international visitors from September. Te Papa will begin charging an entry fee of $35 for international visitors. The charge will apply from Tuesday 17 September 2024 to international visitors aged 16 years and older.
