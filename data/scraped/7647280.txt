The availability of medical marijuana remains on hold in Alabama as the legal fight continues over the process used to select companies for the lucrative licenses. Montgomery County Circuit Judge James Anderson on Thursday rejected a request from the Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission to postpone a court hearing related to accusations that commissioners improperly deliberated in private before selecting the winning companies on Aug. 10. Anderson said the court hearing will go forward next week. The commission asked for a delay to allow the commission to meet again and select new winners without going into executive session. A lawyer for the commission argued a new vote would moot any concerns about the prior meeting. ALABAMA BLOCKED FROM ISSUING MARIJUANA PERMITS FOLLOWING ACCUSATIONS THAT A COMMISSION DELIBERATED ILLEGALLY "While AMCC disagrees with said criticism and contends that its actions during the meeting of August 10 were at all times in accordance with law, it nevertheless understands that these unnecessary challenges are costing precious time for Alabama citizens who need medical cannabis," William H. Webster, a lawyer for the commission, wrote in a court filing. A legal battle over the distribution of medical marijuana licenses in Alabama has been ongoing since the substance became legal in 2021.

JUDGE ASKED TO BLOCK ALABAMA FROM ISSUING MEDICAL MARIJUANA LICENSES Will Somerville, an attorney representing Alabama Always, which did not receive a license, said the selection process has been plagued with problems, including how companies were scored and how meetings were conducted. "The entire process has been shrouded in secrecy. That's not how government is supposed to work in this country," Somerville told reporters.
