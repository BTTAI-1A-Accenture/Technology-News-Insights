With ViewTrade Securities obtaining its carry broker status, ViewTrade’s financial services clients now have a choice to open accounts with clearing firms, brokers and bank custodians connected to ViewTrade’s technology, utilize the carry broker technology to carry their own customer accounts or have ViewTrade Securities, Inc. open, maintain, and carry their customer accounts directly to create an even more seamless and cost-effective customer experience of integrated front, middle, and now back office technology and services. “ViewTrade has seen tremendous growth and adoption of our solutions by a spectrum of market participants and service providers around the world, and the ability to offer carry services through our broker-dealer expands our solution set even further,” said James StClair, President of ViewTrade Securities, Inc. “Our enhanced registration status allows ViewTrade Securities to provide a host of books and records, custody, corporate action, cashiering, confirm, statement, tax and other services directly, giving us greater flexibility in providing global services to our financial services and fintech clients and their customers.” ViewTrade provides technology, support and brokerage services that enable financial services clients to quickly launch or enhance a retail investing experience. Committed to providing seamless and low-cost solutions, ViewTrade’s innovation in products and services is guided by client demand and developed in concert with its financial services clients. “In today's highly competitive market, our clients are looking for ways to streamline, reduce complexity, and obtain turnkey and highly scalable solutions that allow them to focus resources on developing and delivering the edge that sets them apart from the competition. Allowing ViewTrade Securities to carry customer accounts enables our clients to obtain end-to-end, fully integrated solutions from ViewTrade Holding as a single source provider, a real advantage that also comes with an excellent client experience,” said Anthony Petrilli, CEO of ViewTrade Holding Corp.
