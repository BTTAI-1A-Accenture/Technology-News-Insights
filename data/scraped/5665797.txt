  source A good story is a balm for the soul. It can teach you a lesson, fix your mood, or make you forget your worries. In a way, a good story is like online roulette apps which are so captivating that you often focus on them and them alone – just like a story would make you do.  Now, if you do want to try roulette, then you will probably start with Roulette77 for Australian players. But if you want to check out some of the best video games with the best storytelling, then you should read on! The story of a plague that has invaded the mortal realms from other dimensions is perhaps a little drab, but the vividness of character and world-building more than make up for it. Dragon Age is a game with brilliant story-telling that is not weak in any of its permutations. There have been several versions of the game that continue to expand and build upon the action, creating a beautiful, meaningful, and immersive turn-based strategy that brings around one of the most epic RPG sceneries of all times. Players who love the Dragon Age franchise have plenty to be happy about as the game lives on with its latest iteration – Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, a worthwhile continuation of the epic saga. Cowboys, gun-slinging, poker, and the great prairies of the Wild West. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a massive undertaking by the studio behind the game to create a world that defies sandboxiness in video games. The idea here is to completely empower players to explore the Wild West and create a gameplay experience that is never the same. So far, Red Dead Redemption has been able to drive a powerful storytelling precisely because players in the game are not bound by a particular story or plot. Rather, all players are going to influence the world of Red Dead Redemption 2 and shape it in a way that they enjoy – or try to in the very least. So far as storytelling goes, Red Dead Redemption is one of the best games of the past years to have achieved a significant milestone.  Portal 2 is one of the most captivating games when it comes to story. True, you won’t find the long AI narratives, the baked-and-ready explanations of the plot, but you will get the idea. You will be given hints, you will notice posters on the wall, computer logs, and read up on other bits and bobs that come your way. The new story of the sequel is set between 50 and 50,000 years after the events in the original game. The game focuses on two robotic characters and a computer, GLaDOS. The game is focused on solving puzzles using special traveling devices that open portals that connect different spaces together and create a wormhole of sorts. Although working on a small scale, these portals make it possible to drive the action forward. The second game also introduces Aperture founder Cave Johnson. Aperture is the laboratory and scientific facilities that have made it possible for players to use various products for the betterment of mankind and more.  It’s hard to say no to the God of War franchise. Even people who are somewhat unfamiliar with consoles and video games have been engrossed by how fun this game is. The mythological background that the developers have put into the game has allowed for changing and captivating settings throughout the game’s different iterations – from Dante’s Inferno to the Ragnarök, there have been so many different titles to try and enjoy! In each of them, the protagonist, that is you, takes on some of the most fearsome deities who have decided to wipe humanity and only you – a true hero – can stem their tide. The God of War series originated in 2005 and it is still one of the best games when it comes to storytelling.  » Latest game announcements
