 Hello Quite some time ago a wrote an article about hardening Windows Devices, now it's time for a similar approach for macOS Devices. I won't repeat much on the why's and rather go straight to practical part of it. I really want to emphasise that this is based on great and awesome community content which I'll reference here. The most legwork I repurposed here was done by Mischa van der Bent and his version of the  CIS-Script which you can find here.  One missing piece was the custom scoring of the CIS Benchmarks which is based on a plist-file generated by another script and which is consumed during reporting and remediation. But I didn't have to reinvent the wheel here either, but was able to stitch the pieces together by using a version made for macOS Catalina and published on JAMF's github-repo here. In this script an admin can configure the custom scoring for the benchmark by simply editing each OrgScore and set them to true or false as desired. When executed, this script generates the custom org_security_score.plist which is then consumed by the actual reporting-and-remediation script.  Therefore, we're having the following ingredients: What does it do?  You can find the two payloads and the JumpCloud Command itself here. Assembled in a JumpCloud Command it looks like this: From my experience during testing, the execution never exceeded 3 minutes, but to play it save I'm setting a timeout after 5min here.  One recommendation: All settings which you can manage on a macOS-based device via MDM-policies (like Patching, Screen Lock, Password Policies etc.) shall be done this way as they are much more tamper-proof in that case. The report indicates which settings are managed via MDM/Profile and which aren't.  Disclaimer (as usual): Handle with caution and iterate your way through each setting. You might need to dig in deep and test a lot before you gonna apply this to your whole fleet. Hardening procedures can be fairly disruptive for users and their daily experience and might even be counterproductive - potentially leading to circumvention attempts and even increased Shadow IT.  A good starting point is here: macOS Security Compliance Project  When you pivot the latest Guidance for macOS Ventura, you can find highly detailed PDF's on every single configuration item.  Thanks for reading (and sharing) Juergen
