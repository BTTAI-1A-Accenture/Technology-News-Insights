The play follows younger versions of the show's characters, including Jim Hopper and Joyce Maldonado. "Young Jim Hopper's car won't start, Bob Newby's sister won't take his radio show seriously and Joyce Maldonado just wants to graduate and get the hell out of town. When new student Henry Creel arrives, his family finds that a fresh start isn't so easy... and the shadows of the past have a very long reach," an official synopsis reads. Oscar Lloyd will play Hopper, with Isabella Pappas as Joyce, Christopher Buckley as Bob Newby, Patrick Vaill as Dr. Brenner, Louis McCartney as Henry Creel, Ella Karuna Williams as Patty Newby, Michael Jibson as Victor Creel and Lauren Ward as Virginia Creel.
