 The article at this link https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-capacity-market-reform-reserve-margin/643598/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202023-02-27%20Utility%20Dive%20Newsletter%20%5Bissue:48353%5D&utm_term=Utility%20Dive describes the more formal commencement of PJM’s recent effort to modify, again, its wholesale electric market design.  PJM has awakened to the probability that it will not have sufficient dispatchable electric generating resources to keep the lights on.   Not so long ago, PJM was assuring the public and state leaders that PJM was long on generation resources, there was no need for states to extend financial support to nuclear plants for reliability purposes and that such actions would distort the operation of PJM's well-functioning, robust, wholesale electric market. That same PJM is now scrambling, again, to fix, again, the PJM wholesale electric market design. While I am among those who shared PJM’s past snapshot view of the relative adequacy of generation resources within the PJM region, I also contemporaneously asserted that PJM’s market design was a problem that was going to threaten future reliability. This threat arises largely because of: (1) market advantages extended (sometimes through mandates) to “renewable” resources to facilitate “decarbonization” (advantages that produce relative disadvantages for nuclear, coal and natural gas plants at a time of increasing electricity demand); and, (2) the physical inability of PJM to rely on intermittent  generation when it is needed to satisfy demand. Since then, the PJM region has continued to incentivize, in some cases through mandates, generating technologies that are not “dispatchable” when needed to satisfy demand and this continues to accelerate retirement of dispatchable generating resources.  In some cases, the accelerated retirement of thermal units is also being encouraged by the relentless quest of vertically integrated, investor owned, electric utilities to grow the net book value of their "rate base" and earnings.  It is not a question of whether these forces will cause physical reliability problems but when!   Whatever reforms PJM may propose for FERC approval will provoke a big fight at a federal agency that has displayed little willingness or ability to value objective and critical analysis over political convenience. Increasingly, there is a risk that FERC will do nothing because of an inability to assemble a majority vote. Delaying future capacity auctions until FERC approves proposed reforms (as suggested by PJM’s board, per the article) will make things worse in my opinion. For what it may be worth, delaying future capacity auctions (as suggested by PJM’s Board per the article) will make it almost impossible for Ohio and other states to set default retail generation supply prices through the use of the current competitive bidding process.  (Ohio retail electric customers not obtaining generation supply from a competitive supplier and residential customers receiving bill payment assistance have generation supply prices set through this competitive bidding process.)  PJM’s awakening report on reliability (link in the article referenced above) is available here https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/special-reports/2023/energy-transition-in-pjm-resource-retirements-replacements-and-risks.ashx  From the PJM Report Executive Summary (emphasis added):  Our research highlights four trends below that we believe, in combination, present increasing reliability risks during the transition, due to a potential timing mismatch between resource retirements, load growth and the pace of new generation entry under a possible “low new entry” scenario:  · The growth rate of electricity demand is likely to continue to increase from electrification coupled with the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.  · Thermal generators are retiring at a rapid pace due to government and private sector policies as well as economics.  · Retirements are at risk of outpacing the construction of new resources, due to a combination of industry forces, including siting and supply chain, whose long-term impacts are not fully known.  · PJM’s interconnection queue is composed primarily of intermittent and limited-duration resources. Given the operating characteristics of these resources, we need multiple megawatts of these resources to replace 1 MW of thermal generation.  The primary means by which PJM might keep enough thermal generating resources in the game are financial – PJM will raise prices paid to thermal units to provide a profit motive that is aligned with PJM’s evolving reliability targets. PJM will not consider the price or bill impacts for customers; wholesale electric pricing is subject to FERC’s exclusive jurisdiction (states can make this problem worse but they can’t fix this problem). Neither FERC nor PJM have authority to order retiring thermal plants to continue operating.  While PJM and FERC may be able to require investment in incremental transmission capacity, more transmission capacity is not a prudent substitute for dispatchable generation resources properly located.  One more thing.  PJM’s electric market design features a uniform clearing price methodology.  This means that all generators get paid the highest price paid to any generator that offers supply needed to keep the lights on. The uniform clearing price approach will significantly increase the total amount of revenue that will be collected from customers. Government efforts to limit domestic natural gas exploration and production will feed the negative consumer and inflationary impacts of PJM’s uniform clearing price methodology. Was this reliability problem predictable?  Yes. Was it predicted? Yes. For decades, municipal electric utilities and larger customers have urged FERC and PJM to modify the wholesale electric market to make the market a residual market rather than a central market with captive customers. Unless and until customers have a convenient ability to act, through bilateral contracts free of service area limitations, on their own reliability, technology and price preferences, the yin and yang will not rest in complimentary positions. Welcome to another teachable moment. Electricity System Economics Consultant There’s that common ground I suspected we had all along! Very well stated, Sam Randazzo. 

My take is that the single clearing price energy auction design worked great and served the dual purpose of marginal cost recovery and investment incentive for lowest cost new capacity resources when needed – prior to subsidies and mandates for intermittent resources. It remains my contention that the single clearing price LMP energy market contains a de facto capacity payment in its progressive gross margins scheme -  but that those capacity-like (investment inducing) payments are prorated by the inverse of fuel cost - AND THAT allows intermittent resources to capitalize on what should be considered capacity payments, siphoning and suppressing the “energy” revenue pool and the revenue requirement of existing capacity resources. Taylor and I describe and ague this and propose two fair and executable solutions in our comments to FERC docket AD 21–10-000... 

And I’d love to get your thoughts on those comments if you have time.
