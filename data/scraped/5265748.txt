						 There were scenes of wild delight in Castlebar on Thursday evening when Crossmolina captured the Mayo U-16A title for the first time in more than three decades. The 4-11 to 2-10 win over Castlebar Mitchels sent team captain Kobe McDonald up the steps to collect the cup in front of jubilant, celebrating supporters. The Deel boys had to come from behind to win the title after trailing early in the game. They soon stopped the rot and were just a point adrift at half time before surging into the lead after the resumption and sealing the deal in the closing stages. Mitchels were impressive early on with Joe Forry, Harry McHale, Matthew Flannelly, Patrick Garvey and Conor Kavanagh to the fore. They built up a seven-point lead but Crossomlina powered back into it, fueled by the impressive Oisin Deane and McDonald. The gap was down to one at the interval, 2-6 to 2-5, and the boys in maroon took charge after the resumption with two goals from McDonald. Mitchels tried to get back into it but a penalty save by full-back Esmond Maughan stalled their revival and Crossmolina never looked in trouble after that as they closed in on their first title in three decades. Full match report and after-match reaction in Tuesday's Mayo News. 4 To continue reading this article, please subscribe and support local journalism!
