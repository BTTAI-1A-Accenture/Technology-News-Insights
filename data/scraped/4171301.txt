Animal agriculture and its byproducts like leather are leading contributors to climate change.  It’s been estimated that the production of one leather bag requires the clearing of just under a quarter acre of land to provide feed for the cattle needed. Then there is the tanning process to consider which yields its own set of harmful impacts including carcinogens and water contamination. Uncaged Innovations is a biomaterials company that has developed its own proprietary sustainable leather alternative using plant-based inputs.  The material has been developed with eco-friendliness in mind, does not involve any harm to animals, and only uses responsibly sourced elements. Uncaged Innovations can produce a variety of different leather types and textures in mere hours that have the same texture and feel as animal leather while shaving years off of the production process. The process also reduces the quantity of materials needed as there are no unusable patches as a result of natural markings that are not considered aesthetically appropriate for use.  Uncaged’s bioleather is versatile enough to be used in fashion accessories, automobiles, and home applications. AlleyWatch caught up with Uncaged Innovations CEO and Cofounder Stephanie Downs to learn more about the business, the company’s strategic plans, latest round of funding, which brings the total funding raised to $2.3M, and much, much more… Who were your investors and how much did you raise?

Our investors include InMotion Ventures, the investment arm of Jaguar Land Rover, VegInvest, Stray Dog Capital, Alwyn Capital, GlassWall Syndicate, and Hack Capital. Their support and belief in our vision validate the potential of our business model and the value of our vegan bio-leather technology.

With a pre-seed round totaling $2 million in funding, we are well-positioned to drive innovation, expand our capabilities, and make a lasting impact in the market.

Tell us about the product or service that Uncaged Innovations offers. Our product is a bio-leather. BioLeather is a sustainable leather alternative made from plant based-ingredients including grain by-products. The idea was sparked after studying leather fibrils at the ultrastructure and molecular levels. UNCAGED’s bio-interfusion process extracts grain protein molecules and fuses them with other plant-based elements to create a new material that replicates leather. Our mission is to revolutionize the industries of fashion accessories, automobiles, and home goods by providing a vegan alternative to traditional leather. We take pride in producing high-quality bio-leather that is not only stylish but also aligned with our core values of being eco-friendly, sustainable, and cruelty-free.

We envision a future where fashion accessories, automobiles, and home goods can be enjoyed without causing harm to animals or the planet.

My journey toward animal welfare began over two decades ago, but the true turning point came in 1999 when I embarked on my first entrepreneurial venture. Those initial years were filled with excitement and curiosity. However, I needed to give back and find solace in the chaos of entrepreneurship. I decided to volunteer at an animal shelter and little did I know that this simple act of kindness would change my life forever. Immersed in the animal rescue world, I quickly developed an unwavering passion. Witnessing the impact of my involvement and the difference I could make by taking action ignited a fire within me. However, it was a single moment, while enjoying a pork sandwich at a barbecue restaurant, that sparked a profound realization. Here I was, dedicating my time to help animals while simultaneously consuming another form of animal life. Intrigued and compelled to learn more, I delved into online videos that shed light on the realities of animal agriculture. The experience stirred my conscience, and in 2002, I embraced vegetarianism. A few years later, I transitioned to a vegan lifestyle, aligning my actions with my values. This pivotal shift opened a new path for me, one where I could leverage my business acumen to make a tangible difference in the lives of animals. I began assisting animal welfare groups in their outreach efforts to global brands, providing valuable insights into animals and the supply chain. Specifically, I advised companies on how they could remove animals from their supply chains, advocating for compassionate alternatives. The synergy between my passion for animals and my business expertise deepened my understanding of social enterprises, leading me to embark on a new venture—UNCAGED Innovations.

One of the biggest challenges we faced while raising capital, especially in uncertain market conditions, was the increased risk aversion among investors. During economic uncertainty, investors tend to be more cautious and selective in their investment decisions. This can make it challenging to secure funding for a business. Additionally, uncertain market conditions may lead to decreased investor confidence and a reluctance to commit to long-term investments. Investors may be more hesitant to take on new ventures or require more thorough due diligence before deciding. Furthermore, the competition for funding can intensify during uncertain times. With many businesses seeking capital to sustain or grow their operations, the pool of available funding may become more limited. This can create a more competitive landscape, making it crucial to effectively differentiate a business and articulate its unique value proposition. Navigating these challenges requires careful planning and preparation. So, we learned how important it is to build strong relationships with potential investors, demonstrate a solid track record, and showcase our ability to adapt to changing market conditions to instill confidence. While raising capital in uncertain market conditions can be challenging, it is not insurmountable as we did successfully. With a well-thought-out strategy, a compelling business case, and perseverance, we overcame these challenges and secured the necessary funding to support our business goals.
