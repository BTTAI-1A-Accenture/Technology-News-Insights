The global Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) market can be segmented by product type, technology, application, end users and regions. Based on product type, the market is segmented into ex-vivo positive selection, in-vivo positive selection, negative selection, microchips & single spiral micro channel.
On the basis of technology into CTC detection methods, CTC enrichment methods and CTC analysis. The market is segmented by application into Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) biomarkers development, cancer stem cell research, tumorgenesis research and other applications. The market is further segmented by end users into research institutions, hospitals & clinics and diagnostic centers.
CTC are cancerous cells that gets detached from the original spot of the cancer and spread throughout the body through the vascular system. These cells acts as the“seed” for cancer metastases. The highly adverse prognosis for cancer with metastasis has emerged in a rising interest in circulating tumor cells, as they act as an early caution for cancer metastasis.
By region, the globalcirculating tumor cells market scope is segmented into North America, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, out of which, North America accounts for the largest regional market for circulating tumor cell, owing to the high prevalence of cancer in the region. The early adoption of innovative technologies, and the established healthcare sector in the region, especially in the U.S., are primary factors contributing to market growth.
Europe is the second largest region in the global CTC market, on the back of increasing expenditure by the government towards research and development activities to expand the diagnosis and treatment facilities offered to consumers, especially for cancer affected patients. The Asia Pacific is anticipated to have significant growth on account of high growth rate is attributable to the emerging economies such as India and China, which serve as opportunities for market growth, owing to the rising prevalence of cancer, and technological advancements. Vendors identify the importance of this region, particularly in China, India and are working towards penetrating the region by strengthening their sales and distribution networks.
  Rising Cases of Oncology Related Diseases  
Global cancer liability is increasing at an alarming rate, and thus, cancer therapies must be modified in accordance to regional and national priorities. According to the World Cancer Research Fund, in 2018, there were an estimated 18 million cancer cases around the world, out of which, 9.5 million cases were in men and 8.5 million in women. Rising cases of chronic oncology diseases that depend on CTC detection and analysis, as it has enormous potential in real-time monitoring of cancer therapy over methods like imaging technologies and tumor tissue biopsy.
However, CTC tests are expensive since they combine multiple enrichment and detection steps, which involve various assays, instruments, systems, and test kits. This may hamper the growth of the market. Additionally, unmet medical needs in developing regions and a critical lack of appropriate medical facilities in weak economies pose a challenge to the growth of the market.
This report also provides the existing competitive scenario of some of the key players of the global circulating tumor cells market which includes company profiling of key companies: Clearbridge BioMedics, Janssen Diagnostics, LLC, Canopus Biosciences Ltd.,, Apocell,,Advanced Cell Diagnostics,, Miltenyi Biotech Cynvenio Biosystems,, AdnaGen,, Biocep,, Creatv Microtech, Ikonisys, Rarecells Diagnostics, and Nanostring Technologies.
