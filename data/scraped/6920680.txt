Expert Reviewed Updated: Aug 3, 2024, 5:26pm A registered agent is required if you plan to legally form a limited liability corporation (LLC) or corporation in any U.S. state. The purpose of a registered agent is to receive all legal documents for a company, which are often of a confidential and/or proprietary nature. Having a registered agent receive such documents offsite (as is usually the case) prevents any potentially embarrassing or confidential situation from occurring at the main office. While businesses may appoint their own registered agent, many choose to hire one through a registered agent service, which offers professional and affordable services. To find the best registered agent service, I analyzed the 15 leading providers and industry and compared pricing, features, customer support quality and overall reputation.

 Rocket Lawyer is a reliable resource for creating and signing legal documents. It’s also a great way to connect with attorneys and receive legal advice. As such, it’s unsurprising that many businesses rely on Rocket Lawyer to help establish new businesses and maintain compliance through registered agent services. To start, I completed an online form that asked for my full name, the name of my business and contact information. Rocket Lawyer directed me to a page that said they would reach out to me regarding my interest. At this point, I learned that Rocket Lawyer uses its agent’s address for public records; this is highly convenient for keeping your business address private and avoiding any unwanted spam sent your way through third parties. Rocket Lawyer’s registered agent fee is among the most expensive at $249.99 annually. However, you can reduce costs by signing up for Rocket Legal+, which costs $19.99 monthly, billed annually. This brings your registered agent fee down to $124.99 each year. While this does represent some savings, the additional membership fees might not represent cost-effectiveness if you aren’t using Rocket Lawyer features outside the registered agent (RA) service. When you sign up for registered agent service through Rocket Lawyer or begin forming a business through the website, for which you will need an RA, you should expect a call or email from a Rocket Lawyer team member, as this was my experience. Rocket Lawyer is highly proactive in getting you signed up for its service. If you need to reach out for assistance, you can contact a team member by chat, email, or phone. Rocket Lawyer has a solid reputation on the web, thanks to thousands of positive reviews. Many of the customers mentioned good experiences with customer support. For instance, I spotted a review in which a customer had difficulty understanding plan details, but a live agent eventually helped them understand the items included in their order. A few dissatisfied customers, meanwhile, said they had trouble canceling service during or following a free trial period. Steve Strauss, our advisory board member, adds that “Rocket Layer has been around since the early days of the Internet and is a well-known, trusted small business resource.” Learn More: Read our complete Rocket Lawyer review.

 If you operate a company in multiple states, you need an agent in each state in that you operate, which can be rather complex if you are left to rely on multiple providers. However, with Northwest Registered Agent you can hire an agent in up to 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. Additionally, Northwest offered me a free business domain for a year and access to legal advice. I was also asked if I wanted to send lawsuit information directly to my attorney; if you select yes, remember to include the lawyer’s email address. There was also an offer to let Northwest file mandatory Beneficial Ownership Information on my behalf. I was required to create an account later in the sign-up process; though this is common, it would be nice to have the option to continue as a guest. Later, I could select various add-ons, such as a business email, website and phone service, all available at no upfront cost. I also appreciated the choice to get compliance filing for up to 46 jurisdictions simultaneously. Northwest Registered Agent charges $125 annually for service in each state, though the more states where you request their services, the better the per-state rate. For instance, the $125 per state charge stayed the same until I selected five states, at which point the rate dropped to $100 per jurisdiction. If you are a nationwide business needing a registered agent in every state, it would cost about $5,000 per year. If you need help, you can contact Northwest Registered Agent by phone or by submitting a contact form on the website. In my experience, its support is notoriously—and reliably—top-notch. It’s not only very friendly and helpful, but quick to answer any questions or solve any issues. Northwest Registered Agent received much praise from entrepreneurs new to the business formation process and obtaining a registered agent and found its service very helpful. Other positive reviews came from business owners who required agents across multiple states and found Northwest’s service very convenient. On the other hand, some customers complained that the website was “buggy” and others were upset about fees they felt weren’t adequately explained before getting charged. Chris Townsend, expert marketing consultant of Three Movers, shared his thoughts as well: “Northwest Registered Agent is not only a well-known company but also one of the top registered agent services in the market today. In my opinion, the most impressive aspect of Northwest is its personalized service and excellent customer support, which is undoubtedly one of the best. They follow the one-on-one approach in serving different clients, thus they clearly understand an individual client’s needs.” Learn More: Read our Northwest Registered Agent review.

 In addition to offering registered agent services, ZenBusiness provides a range of features and add-ons to help business owners quickly launch new companies or keep them compliant. In addition to a registered agent, ZenBusiness has a “Worry-Free” compliance add-on that, when combined with an agent, ensures that any state or legal obligations get handled year over year. The sign-up process with ZenBusiness felt similar to communicating with someone through a mobile chat. ZenBusiness briefly explained that it would handle all official mail. The form allowed me to choose agent service in multiple states while clarifying my home state and the type of business entity for which I would need an agent. Based on my experience with its process, getting a registered agent through ZenBusiness is simple and easy, making it ideal for newer business owners. ZenBusiness charges $199 per year for registered agent service. This should not get confused with the “Worry-Free” compliance add-on, which is also $199 and gets bundled into business formation packages. ZenBusiness’s fee is pricier than alternatives, especially if combined with the compliance add-on. However, it should still be considered, as it could work well for a business owner with a more generous budget. You can reach a member of the ZenBusiness support team by phone, email, chat, or by filling out a website contact form. ZenBusiness enjoys a good reputation among most customers, with many writing glowing comments regarding the customer support they received while either setting up a new business or attempting to use it as a registered agent. While a few customers weren’t as impressed by customer service agents, I found that much of the dissatisfaction seemed to center on fees or the difficulty of ending ZenBusiness subscription services. Steve Strauss, our advisory board member, added: “ZenBusiness is a newcomer to the game, but with backing from Mark Cuban, you can bet it’s top-notch.” Learn More: Read our full ZenBusiness review.

 At first glance, LegalZoom might feel similar to Rocket Lawyer in that it is a diversified legal resource for individuals and companies rather than specializing in all matters related to business formation. However, LegalZoom offers a more centralized space for registering new businesses, keeping them compliant and also protecting your brand. LegalZoom’s order process is swift and simple. I completed all the relevant information, including payment information, within a few minutes. LegalZoom showed exactly what I would be paying and also informed me of a few crucial details, such as that the rate would renew annually and that I could cancel their RA service by phone or online. You cannot cancel your registered agent service with LegalZoom without filing the necessary paperwork to replace the business with a new agent. This isn’t exclusive to LegalZoom; rather, it’s a requirement by all states to have an RA in place, but it is nice to see this vital information shared before customers sign up for the service. Jonathan Feniak, General Attorney at LLC Attorney, finds a few reasons to like LegalZoom: “The platform’s clear instructions and variety of service offerings make it an appealing choice for new business owners. A noteworthy aspect is their robust customer service, which can answer queries promptly and efficiently.” LegalZoom charges $249 per year for its registered agent service, which makes it a little pricier than some alternatives. It is more or less an add-on service; I noted that it wasn’t included as a bundle in any of its formation packages, so you would need to include it as an upfront cost if you planned to establish a new business and want to include a registered agent. You can reach LegalZoom’s support team by phone or chat. If you prefer self-service or have more general questions that don’t require direct help, LegalZoom has a huge library of articles that offer guidance on how to build or maintain your business. If you are looking for financial assistance, LegalZoom provides grants to small businesses thanks to a partnership with BA, WNBA and NBA G League. LegalZoom’s overall reputation skews positive, thanks to thousands of online customer reviews. Satisfied clients appreciated the fast and easy process and praised the support team. I even saw a customer who initially rated the company one star but adjusted their feedback to four stars thanks to properly addressing their issues. Learn More: Read our complete LegalZoom review.

 Bizee, formerly Incfile, is primarily a business formation company, though it also provides registered agent services for clients. You can get this as a standalone option or as part of a formation package. If you establish your business through Bizee, you will not be charged for your first year of registered agent service. During the order process, I was asked to provide details such as my name and phone number, with a note that my number would be necessary for obtaining additional information or updating me regarding the status of my order. As a business is required to maintain a registered agent, you cannot simply cancel and risk letting representation lapse. As a courtesy, Bizee offers to assist with your change of registered agent process by filing all related documents on your behalf. Javier Muniz, the CTO of LLC Attorney, shared his thoughts on the platform with us: “Bizee offers intuitive dashboards and a strong focus on customer support, making it a viable option for small businesses requiring hands-on, personal assistance.” Bizee’s $119 annual fee for registered agents puts it in an affordable price range for most businesses. If you choose to form an LLC or corporation through Bizee, you get a registered agent free for your first year, making it a great way to start a new business venture while keeping initial costs fairly low. In addition to having live support agents available by phone, you can get assistance through the live chat option on the website. Since support is live, rather than a bot, you may not be able to get immediate assistance if you use the chat box outside of regular business hours. As Bizee was previously known as Incfile, most existing reviews are based on customer feedback associated with the old name. There are tens of thousands of ratings for the company available online, with much of the feedback being very positive. Customers happy with Bizee mentioned how quick and easy the process was and how well the sales and support team helped them get the most from purchased features. The negative feedback I found often had to do with difficulty reaching someone or struggling to get around automated channels to directly engage Bizee agents. Others were unsatisfied with the speed of the process and what they felt to be a lack of adequate communication. Learn More: Read our complete Bizee review.

 Harbor Compliance differs from the other brands on this list in that it focuses on offering solutions that help businesses maintain good standing and follow government regulations. It provides registered agent services and assists with other essential compliance needs, such as obtaining business licenses and filing annual reports. Sign-up is relatively easy; you may choose a registered agent across multiple jurisdictions at a time. What impressed me the most was the ability to select Harbor Compliance as your registered agent for up to 10 years. While this may not be ideal for those wary of long-term contracts, this is a very convenient option if you prefer to have your registered agent services sorted for the next several years. Chris Townsend, expert marketing consultant of Three Movers, shared his thoughts on the service: “Harbor Compliance is one of the most holistic registered agent services available in the market and aims to offer a comprehensive spectrum of compliance services not just for small businesses but also for large ones. They provide us with a variety of such services, including annual reports, corporate filing and making sure tax and regulatory deadlines are met in several states.” Harbor Compliance charges just $99 per year for a registered agent, making it highly affordable and a great low-cost choice for small businesses or new entrepreneurs. Additionally, the company provides a volume discount that reduces its annual fee by 10% if you agree to terms between two and 10 years. Harbor Compliance is available by phone, email and fax and has a help center to answer common questions. If you want to learn about your company’s compliance quality, Harbor Compliance also has a scoring system that searches public databases to determine your current status and detect potential gaps. I couldn’t find as many customer reviews for Harbor Compliance as most of the services on this list, though from what I did see, the feedback is mostly positive. Satisfied customers appreciated the streamlined process and felt it saved them time and money. Others found them to be knowledgeable and efficient. Meanwhile, unhappy customers repeatedly referenced difficulty connecting with service team members to correct errors or get updates on their service. Learn More: Read our Harbor Compliance review.

 For budget-conscious business owners, Inc Authority represents good value for money. Not only does it offer a $0 base fee for creating an LLC, but Inc Authority also offers premium add-ons for free, including EIN obtainment and a full year of registered agent service for no added cost. Whether Inc Authority offered registered agent services as a standalone feature wasn’t immediately easy to confirm; the related blog page to which I was directed talked about registered agents in general and almost exclusively focused on upselling Inc Authority’s LLC formation services. It would have been a great chance to break down year-over-year costs beyond the first free year available with the standard and premium bundles. David Brillant, a tax, trust and estate attorney at Brillant Law Firm, shared his thoughts onthe service: “Inc Authority offers a straightforward and accessible registered agent service that is ideal for entrepreneurs who are just starting out and need basic, reliable compliance at an affordable cost. Their user-friendly interface and customer support make the process less daunting for new business owners.” If you use Inc Authority as a registered agent, you will ultimately pay $179 annually. If you want to keep upfront fees low while starting a new business, you can delay this cost by getting a standard or premium package with Inc Authority and a registered agent free through your first year. If you need customer support, you can submit a request through the form on the “Contact Us” page or call. If calling, know that Inc Authority’s live agents operate between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. PST. Inc Authority has a largely positive reputation, with tens of thousands of customer reviews available across the web. Happy customers all mentioned their appreciation for the brand’s customer service and how helpful sales and customer support members were in guiding new entrepreneurs through the sign-up process. Inc Authority’s highest praise came from those particularly new to owning their own business. A few customers encountered issues, with complaints ranging from missing forms to unexplained charges. I noticed that some problems were partially caused by customer confusion, so Inc Authority could have explained pricing and package features better. Though most customers seemed to have a good experience, it may be worth confirming the exact details of what you would be paying for to avoid unnecessary problems.

 If you are pressed for time or prefer to see items processed as quickly as possible, SunDoc Filings might be a good choice for your business. The company is a nationwide brand capable of promptly handling critical state, legal and tax documents, and depending on which services you need, it may be possible to move through their system in as little as 24 hours. Javier Muniz, CTO of LLC Attorney, also noted SunDoc’s fast service: “SunDoc Filings impresses with speedy processing times. Its efficiency can be crucial for businesses wanting to hit the ground running.” Signing up with SunDoc was relatively easy and fast; placing an order took only a few minutes. I appreciated that there was a chat option available in case I had any questions before purchase. I could also add comments related to the order to provide SunDoc Filing with additional or essential information. SunDoc Filing charges $159 per year for registered agent service. You can pay for this as a standalone feature or part of the business formation process. When I went through the checkout process, SunDoc charged $149 for a registered agent, a $10 discount. You can get support from SunDoc Filings by phone or email. Interestingly, SunDoc provides ways to contact sales and service team members directly. This is an excellent approach for assuring you work with the same person throughout the sales process or that you can directly communicate any service issues to the same person rather than randomly getting assigned to an agent. It also lets you confidently share who you were satisfied or unhappy with by name, which is good for transparency. I was able to locate thousands of reviews for SunDoc Filing, most of which are very positive. Many customers praised SunDoc for being fast and efficient and said they heard back immediately when they reached out to support team members. Negative feedback came from a few customers who weren’t pleased with the items received or felt that the process didn’t move as fast as they preferred; a few mentioned payment issues. When reviewing unhappy customer responses, I did note that members of the SunDoc staff responded to those comments directly with further clarification. Learn More: Read our SunDoc Filing review.

 Incorporate.com offers a simple, no-fuss solution for registered agent service. It also has a tool called CSCNavigator that provides automated alerts when filings are due. When I ordered the registered agent service, it was available as a standalone service and an add-on as part of a business formation process. Unfortunately, there were no apparent discounts, which some competitors offer. Moreover, I noticed that Incorporate.com charges a fee to file a “change of registered agent” form with the state, but such a filing is not necessary for first-time business filings. That aside, Incorporate.com provides a simple and fast process that should work for most customers, especially those new to maintaining their company’s good standing. David Brillant, a tax, trust and estate attorney at Brillant Law Firm, shared his thoughts on the service: “Incorporate.com excels in providing a robust service that ensures legal compliance across various states, which is crucial for businesses with a multi-state presence. Their alert system for legal and tax document deadlines is particularly valuable, helping businesses avoid penalties.” Incorporate.com provides a straightforward price of $235 per year for a registered agent. While there are less expensive choices, Incorporate.com should still be considered as a simple and fast option. If cost is an issue, there are more budget-friendly services available. I appreciate that Incorporate.com provides customer support services for those who have new orders and those who are calling about an existing order. This distinction is useful for avoiding a backlog of customers who have different needs and are at different parts of the purchasing process. It is difficult to find a wide range of customer reviews for Incorporate.com or CSC, as it is sometimes known. The overall impression of the brand is mixed, with dissatisfied customers claiming that features are overpriced or that it is hard to cancel services. Learn More: Read our Incorporate.com review.

 Swyft Filings provides registered agents and other compliance tools to business owners, in addition to filing the RA paperwork on your behalf. If you are worried about additional costs on top of what you’ll pay for formation or registered agent fees, Swyft offers savings in free shipping and no-cost electronic deliveries of any documents and paperwork your agent needs to send to you. In addition to registered agents, Swyft provides compliance support through obtainment of business licenses and permits. Andrew Pierce, CEO of LLC Attorney, finds Swyft’s compliance top notch: “Swyft Filings stands above the crowd with a comprehensive compliance guarantee that ensures business entities abide by state requirements.” Swyft Filings costs $199 per year for a registered agent; you can also file to change your registered agent to Swyft, which costs $149. It’s unclear if changing your agent results in a service discount, as this was presented as an annual charge rather than a one-time fee to switch registered agents. Swyft Filings didn’t give any explanations during checkout. I would have liked more transparency here, as it could cause wary customers to reconsider switching agents. If you need assistance, you can call or start a chat with the support team. I sent a message through the chat, and though I was told to expect a response in about an hour, I only waited a few moments. I asked a follow-up question regarding the cost of switching registered agents, as it seemed strange to me that this was presented as an annual fee instead of a one-time filing cost. Unfortunately, I was not given a direct answer via the chat box. The way my questions were answered felt bot-like or scripted. It might be better to reach out by phone to ensure you speak to a live agent. Swyft Filings has a positive reputation and has garnered thousands of customer reviews. Those who were pleased with Swyft shared positive interactions with sales or support team members and felt the company is professionally run. The negative feedback I found mentioned difficulty in canceling services. Some customers were unhappy with their inability to get a refund. Learn More: Read our Swyft Filings review.

  Learn how we evaluate company formation services. A registered agent is a person who receives important legal and tax documents on behalf of your company. Business owners use registered agents to ensure legal documents are received and handled appropriately. All businesses registered with a state must have a registered agent. Formal business entities, including LLCs and corporations, are required by law to designate a registered agent for their business. You can choose to serve as your own registered agent or purchase registered agent services. Going with a service provider over doing it yourself has several pros and cons. According to small business author and advisory board member Steve Strauss, while all of the above reasons are equally valid, “the best reason to hire a reputable registered agent is the privacy factor. Especially when it comes to the service of legal documents, that is the sort of thing that any corporation wants to keep private and confidential. That is exactly what a registered agent provides.” Ask an expert Brette Sember, J.D. Contributor Steve Strauss Small Business Expert Kelly Reilly Editorial Director If you plan to be available at your business address every business day, all year, being your own registered agent is possible. However, this responsibility, in addition to running your business, can be too much for many people. A registered agent provider ensures that your business is protected and that any important notices are delivered so you don’t miss something crucial. Contributor No. The best reason to hire a reputable registered agent is the privacy factor. Especially when it comes to the service of legal documents, that is the sort of thing that any corporation wants to keep private and confidential. That is exactly what a registered agent provides. Small Business Expert I wouldn’t recommend it. Not only does it take time and energy away from you focusing on the most important areas of your business, but it also creates opportunities for costly errors if you make a mistake.

You may also want to consider other legal services that are offered by the provider, as many businesses prefer to consolidate their legal matters with one legal representative. This Forbes Advisor list of the best registered agent services is a terrific place to start your search for your registered agent. When hiring a registered agent, be sure the provider you select delivers the solutions you need. Here are the essential services you should expect from your registered agent: Each state has slightly different requirements for who can and cannot serve as a registered agent. In all states, registered agents must be 18 years or older and maintain a physical address in the state; P.O. boxes are not allowed. The chart below highlights the main requirements, though you will need to consult with your state for exact regulations. *Maine requires that corporations and LLCs have an agent of service of process. When shopping for registered agent services, you may wonder if there’s a big difference between going with a local vs. a national service provider. Going with a national provider offers a few advantages for companies conducting business in multiple states. Most national registered agent services can support you in every state you are registered to conduct business as a corporation or LLC. If your business is registered in multiple states, you’ll need an agent in each state. Having one service provider that can cover you in all the states in which you operate is not only efficient for you, it may help you save money as some registered agencies offer discounts for multiple-state registrations. If you only plan to form a business in a single state, you may prefer to go with a local registered agent provider. Fees vary among local providers, as do their capabilities; however, you may be able to obtain services from a local agency for less money—sometimes half or even less—than you’d pay a national provider. Before selecting a local provider, be sure to check out customer reviews on its Google Business Profile or other local customer review sites, as service quality varies considerably. All registered agent services use software to scan, upload and store legal, tax and other documents on behalf of their clients. Clients can then access these documents through a secure, private portal. However, the ease of accessing these documents can vary between different service providers. You want to verify you can quickly and easily retrieve your documents whenever you need them. Investigate the software the registered agent service uses and ask for a preview of the dashboard you will use for document management. This preview of what to expect can help you evaluate whether the software is user-friendly and offers the features you need to manage your documents effectively. By choosing a service provider with easy-to-use software, you can avoid frustration, save time and ensure that you always have the documents you need at your fingertips.

 How much a registered agent costs will vary according to your needs and budget. If you reside within the state where you plan to establish a business and are over 18, you could act as your own agent in most circumstances. However, if that is not practical, you must hire a third party. Below is a range of such services and their prices; some providers may charge as little as $0 through the first year if you get a registered agent while forming a new business entity. State Registered Agent Services Guides 
 A registered agent is someone you designate to receive specific types of documents—typically legal, state, regulatory and tax-related—on your behalf. Then, your agent shares those documents with you by scanning and uploading them to an online portal or forwarding them to your address. A registered agent may call you or send you a text message if they receive an urgent message, such as a court document or upcoming deadline notice. If your business is registered with a state, you need to appoint a registered agent, sometimes called a statutory agent. You can act as a registered agent for your business. To do so, you’ll need a street address where you can be contacted on behalf of your business as states will not accept post office boxes for registered agents. Registered agents must have a physical address capable of accepting mail during business hours. The process for changing your registered agent varies by state but usually involves filing a state-specific change of registered agent statement. This form can usually be obtained through your state’s main website portal for businesses. While some states don’t charge to make the change, others require a modest standard or expedited filing fee, typically between $10 and $75. Registered agents may assume limited liability for business costs resulting from the delayed transmission of legal documents. For instance, if a legal document is obtained by the agent but not communicated to the represented business promptly, and the business suffers financial losses as a result of this delay, the agent may be held liable. For specific liability questions in your situation, we recommend you consult your attorney. Registered agent rules vary by state. While it’s more common to have your business address be different than your registered agent’s, in some states, you can use your agent’s address as your business address. You cannot use your registered agent’s address as your business address when applying for an EIN. When you hire registered agent services, that agent is not a member of your LLC. Some LLC owners choose to serve as the registered agent for their business.
