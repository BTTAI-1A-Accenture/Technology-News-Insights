During last week’s Carroll Chamber of Commerce annual banquet, Journey Senior Services was named the 2022 New Business of the year. The Business awards were developed to encourage and showcase chamber businesses that strive for excellence. The New Business award celebrates a company that started within the last five years. Ted Garringer, principal at Kuemper Catholic, presented the award. He says Journey is an outstanding facility dedicated to providing meaningful service for individuals with memory loss. Garringer says Journey supports the community’s hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics. Nancy Snyder, who runs the facility, says this award has come as a surprise. Kenney Snyder says Journey Senior Services could not exist without the many businesses in Carroll. Other award recipients from Monday’s Carroll Chamber of Commerce banquet include: Citizen of the year, Matt Greteman; Heritage Business, Dahn and Woodhouse Funeral Home; Public Service Rod Roberts, Public Service Sharon Olerich, and Humanitarians Kellan’s Kingdom.  Be the first to know latest important news & events directly to your inbox.
