Bored as well as broke? We’ve got good news for you. This September, there’s a slew of markets, fairs, performances, talks and workshops to keep you entertained and informed at zero cost. Look forward to the Singapore River Festival 2023, a Sanrio-themed garden wonderland light-up, and a special FEASTival (their pun, not ours) coming to a shopping mall (hopefully) near you. Here’s your guide to the top 36 free things to do in September 2023.

No, it’s not just pretty lights by the Singapore River to make you go “ooh, pretty!”. The Singapore River Festival 2023 is bringing you live music, augmented reality (AR) experiences, and experiential food workshops, and Japanese pop culture-themed events. Visit the Singapore River Festival website to see what events you can look forward to. My personal favourite highlight of the Singapore River Festival 2023 is a weekend (23–24 Sep) of pet-friendly activities by the river, including a best-dressed pet competition, a merchandise bazaar, pet health checks, and talks by veterinary professionals. Calling all furry, feathered, or scaly friends! Crane at Joo Chiat is opening up their doors to you on Sept 9 and 10, 2023 for a weekend of yummy treats, fun playtime, and cute pet accessories. Like many of the other weekend fairs on this list, all vendors at Pets Weekend will be small businesses in Singapore so you can #supportlocal.

Or an entire bedsheet set for the same price? Giant is having a mega clearance sale with all kinds of items offered at 1 of these 6 price points: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $40. These include: The only catch is that these sales are only happening at 5 outlets: Tampines Hypermarket, IMM, Sembawang Shopping Centre, Loyang Point, and Pioneer Mall.

This September, these worlds collide in the best way possible at VivoCity's Skypark with Garden of Lights. It's a nightly light-up wonderland featuring light installations of everyone's favourite Sanrio cuties, including Cinnamoroll, Gudetama, My Melody, and-of course-Hello Kitty. Get your cameras ready and head there early to take advantage of the photo ops. The exhibit is open from 10am to 10pm daily, although the Sanrio garden wonderland only lights up from 6.30pm onwards. Garden of Lights Everyone wants a safe space where you can just be you, and be supported. Not everyone has such spaces in their lives—but everyone deserves them. That’s why Growth Collective SG has organised Growth Circles, 2-hour sessions for individuals to connect meaningfully and feel empowered by each other. It’s about showing support, being present, and ultimately building a world where no one feels alone. Here’s how a month’s worth of Growth Circle sessions looks like: These are the Growth Circles sessions in September:  "Mental Wellness Begins with All of Us"-that's the theme of this year's Beyond the Label (BTL) Festival. Held at Jewel Changi Airport this year, the festival will feature educational workshops, games, fireside chats, and music/dance performances that aim to get you thinking and talking about mental health. The idea behind the theme is that mental wellness is a shared responsibility, and we all have a part to play in our homes, workplaces and common spaces.

Families for Life (FFL) Family Singalong Picnic One of my closest friends used to use the dating app Tinder-not to date, but to make friends. She would chat with people on the app-filtering out any creeps, of course-and actually made some meaningful friendships from her efforts. These days, there's an easier, non-virtual way to make friends. Friendzone hosts community-building gatherings for young adults to connect with each other and develop friendships. They believe ​​that Singapore is, and I quote, "full of diversity and interesting people that just haven't met yet". If you don't agree, maybe you should give one of their sessions a try. This month, they have two free sessions you can attend. Remember to respect that these are friend-making events, not dating ones. Westies, we hope you’re hungry. From now till Sept 10, 2023, Jurong Point is hosting the FEASTival Fair.

Across many strands of different cultures and backgrounds, we can “thread through” communities to celebrate diversity. How do we do that? And as we promote interconnectedness, is individuality lost? You’ll have to go down to TEDxNTU 2023 to find out. TEDxNTU 2023: Threading Through Singapore Design Week (SDW) showcases the best of local design and creativity.

The theme is a celebration of how Singapore design makes lives better, tackles challenges, and shapes our future.

When it comes to interior design, there’s no better place to explore this than the Singapore Interior Design Festival (SIDFest). [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CvwosfjvXwX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==[/embed] This year, the festival includes its annual flagship conference SID Convention 2023 on 23 Sep 2023, at the Sands Expo Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, as well as 5 SIDFest 2023 Symposiums that touch on topics like sustainability and AI in design business.

Every Sunday evening, tucked away in Bali Lane, you can get a taste of live jazz jams at The Jazz Loft @ Blu Jaz Café at no cover charge. Called the Sunday Jam Sessions, each session opens with pianist Rachma Lim and her trio. Then, homegrown and international jazz stars take the stage—some familiar faces already well established in the jazz world, and some up and coming jazz musicians paving the way for a new wave of jazz. You never really know exactly who you’ll get to hear (to our knowledge, they don’t publish this anywhere), but perhaps the mystery is part of the appeal. Just like jazz improv, every iteration is unique. Sunday Jam Session at The Jazz Loft Whether you’re a seasoned runner or just getting started, the Puma Run Club is a great community to help you meet your running goals. Remember how in 2.4km runs in school, you’d pick a fit person ahead of you to try to keep up with?

After you’re done, the pacers will also lead you in a cool down to end off the session. So really all you need to do is to show up for yourself and give it your best shot!
