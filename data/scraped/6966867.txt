 The World Economic Forum's Artificial Intelligence for Agriculture Innovation (AI4AI) initiative aims to transform the agriculture sector in India by promoting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies. Led by the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (C4IR) India and the Platform for Shaping the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the initiative brings together government, academia and business representatives to collaborate on the development and implementation of innovative solutions in the agriculture sector. Through AI4AI, the Saagu Baagu pilot was launched in partnership with the Government of Telangana, making it the first Indian state to implement a framework for scaling up emerging technologies and improving productivity, efficiency and sustainability in the agriculture sector. The pilot is driven by C4IR India, Government of Telangana and Digital Green in collaboration with three agricultural technology businesses: AgNext, Krishitantra and Kalgudi. As of January 2023, more than 7,000 farmers have enrolled in the pilot project, with a focus on chili producers. These farmers are receiving support in the form of various AI technologies, including sowing quality testing, soil testing, crop health monitoring, window prediction and tillage estimation, as well as accessing new customers and suppliers in different geographies.
