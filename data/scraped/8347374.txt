Today PNG Power Ltd has significant overdue payments to Puma Energy that remain unpaid. Puma Energy in a statement said some of the overdue payments are more than 90 days past their due date, despite repeated reminders. “This means that PNG Power is well beyond its credit limit and is failing to abide by the agreed contractual terms,” Puma said. “Following a lengthy process of requesting payment, which PNG Power declined to do, we have been unfortunately forced to reduce supply of fuel until such payment is made. “We have made every effort to continue fuel supplies and minimise the impact on the public. “This includes maintaining the supply for essential services within key locations even though we have significant overdues.” PNG Power chief executive officer, Obed Batia, in a statement said that PNG Power will ensure to source fuel to be delivered to its power stations so power can be restored. “Furhermore PPL is working to ensure all its other smaller centres are supplied with fuel to get them running.” He said this when Wewak, Aitape and Alotau were experiencing load-shedding after Puma put out a ‘no supply’ notice to PNG Power. He said Puma has agreed to start supply on Wednesday, February 1, 2023. However, Puma said the statement issued by PNG Power on Wednesday which stated that Puma intended to re-start supply of fuel to PNG Power is unfortunately incorrect, due to a lack of payment. Puma Energy raised these concerns after PNG Power released a statement on Wednesday saying that the load-shedding experienced in Wewak, Aitape and Alotau is due to lack of fuel supply, which prompted frustrated residents in Wewak to attack the Puma Energy manager in Wewak. “The violence against a member of Puma Energy staff in Wewak, East Sepik Province, that transpired due to PNG Power’s overdue debt, is totally unacceptable and we look to the relevant authorities to investigate the incident,” Puma said.
