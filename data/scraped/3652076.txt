It's always a good day when you can celebrate the bonus gift. In the case of Deion Sanders and his relationship with Aflac, it was something unexpected that made his day on Friday.  The world-renowned insurance giant gave Coach Prime a new set of wheels to whip around campus ahead of the big matchup with USC. A custom Prime golf cart with Aflac branding on the tail gate was presented to him. Sanders has been a spokesman for the company since his days at Jackson State in 2021.  
 “I’m loving Aflac right now,” Sanders said in an Instagram post. 
 According to a rep from Aflac, the cart is a pretty sweet ride to say the least. It's equipted with leather seats, a built in cooler, under the seat storage, and a relaxed sound system. The right touch with gold rims to fit Coach Prime's "Ain't Hard to Find" mentality. Let's hope CU campus police doesn't ticket his new whip before he has a chance to break it in. Sanders has needed a golf cart ever since he went through a few rounds of blood clot surgeries. It has been a signature of his during his time in Boulder.  Colorado hosts No. 8 USC on Saturday.
