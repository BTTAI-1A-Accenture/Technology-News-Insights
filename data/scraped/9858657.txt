Microsoft and electronic medical records giant Epic Systems announced a collaboration earlier this week to bring GPT-4, the latest version of OpenAI’s large language models, into health systems. It’s being offered as part of Microsoft’s cloud platform Azure, as the tech company looks to increase market share among healthcare cloud users. “My perception of Microsoft's greater healthcare strategy is that they really want to be the infrastructure platform for healthcare,” says Alexander Lennox-Miller, lead healthcare IT research analyst at CB Insights. While cloud adoption in healthcare is still early, many hospital systems have a multi-cloud approach, which means they use more than one vendor. The coming arms race will be all about finding ways to make products “more sticky” – and one way for Microsoft to do that is to ensure that its generative AI “plays really nice” with the electronic medical record, since data exchange across different software systems is one of the industry’s biggest headaches. In the future, that could be “a really strong reason not to jump ship,” he says. The big questions swirling around the use of this technology have been around the accuracy and fairness of the underlying algorithms and these test cases will provide evidence of how they perform in real-world settings. The first application includes using generative AI to draft responses to patient messages and is being tested by UC San Diego Health, UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, and Stanford Health Care. Another application will help with data analysis that helps hospitals find trends among their broader patient population.
