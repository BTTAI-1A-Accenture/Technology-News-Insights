These pages  aim to provide simple, easy to follow guidance and advice on the risks of  exposure to noise, specific to engineering industries, and gives possible  solutions to some common noise problems in engineering. Where it is  reasonably practicable to do so, employers must reduce noise exposure by means
  other than  the provision of hearing protection. A person's overall noise exposure may come directly from an individual machine,   but noise from other machinery or processes elsewhere in the workshop may also   contribute to this. This means that as well as a machine operator  people at risk include those working nearby, for example, maintenance fitters,  cleaners, fork lift truck drivers and shop floor supervisors.  Below are some  examples of typical everyday noise levels and noise levels for a selection of  engineering processes where no steps have been taken to reduce noise are given  below: Inspectors  often comment that the noisiest item in a workshop is the radio. 
Do  you have a noise problem at work?
 If  you know you have a noise problem then the section on managing  noise risk and specific advice for employers/managers will be  useful. The section on how to protect  your workers includes help with health surveillance.
