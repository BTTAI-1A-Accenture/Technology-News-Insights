   Date (MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq)  Covina, Sept. 18, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Overview of the Network automation Market:   Network automation is a transformative approach to managing and controlling computer networks by using software, scripts, and other automated processes to perform tasks that traditionally required manual intervention. It aims to streamline network management, improve efficiency, reduce human error, and enable the rapid deployment of network services. Automation can optimize network resource usage, contributing to energy efficiency in data centers and network infrastructure. The growth of remote work has increased the demand for secure and automated remote access solutions which further facilitated the demand for   Network Automation Market  growth.   Key Findings:     In April 2022, Gluware launches RPA to simplify network automation workflow. The newest addition to Gluware's intelligent network automation package, Network Robotic Process Automation (RPA), is made to assist network engineers and operators in creating process-oriented automations rather than automating single operations in a labor-intensive coding manner. Network RPA's primary purpose is to make the integration of several automated tasks into workflows simpler.   In October 2022, Nokia launched app marketplace for broadband network automation. Seven new apps for network assistance, network insights, and network automation are now available in the Altiplano Application Marketplace. Nokia apps as well as third-party and operator-built apps will be available on Marketplace. In conjunction, the Altiplano Developer Portal and SDK for app developers are made available.
