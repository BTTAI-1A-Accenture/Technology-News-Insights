19th Aug, 2024 The Early Response Service provided by Universal Care Services avoids unnecessary hospital admissions by supporting people at home with care. The Home Discharge Service provided by Nationwide Care Services supports people when they are discharged from hospital, so they can come home as soon as they are able to. It provides up to six weeks free care supporting people to regain as much independence as possible.   Coun Tony Dicicco, cabinet member for Adult Social Care and Health, said: “These urgent community response services are really good news for Solihull residents and our health partners, as well as for the two local care providers. “The services were piloted by Universal Care Services and Nationwide Care Services during the pandemic as we responded to changing regulations and pressures on the health service, particularly around hospital discharges. “Having gone through a competitive tender process, the providers have been awarded the contracts to deliver support the same day the request is made, with dedicated care teams for our residents.
