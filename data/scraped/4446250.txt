To support America's future generation of leaders, guests can round up their purchases each time they visit a Casey's store.  "Learning is the foundation to sparking curiosity and creating brighter futures for kids," said Katie Petru, director, communications and community at Casey's. "Through our Cash for Classrooms program, we're helping bring meaningful projects and innovative initiatives to life, in Casey's communities now and for years to come." Since 2020, the program has raised $3 million for students, families and educators through a combination of the round-up donations and Casey's partnership with LIFEWTR. Grants have been awarded to more than 250 schools across the c-store chain's 16-state footprint. In 2022, 79 grants were awarded to K-12 public and nonprofit, private schools in 75 Casey's communities. The funding priorities through the program include projects supporting physical improvements, material needs, teacher support and community engagement initiatives in the areas Casey's serves.  The 2023 grant application opens in October and is available here. Cenex, in partnership with Pinnacle Cooperative, awarded Prairie Grit Adaptive Sports with a $25,000 Hometown Pride grant for its commitment to building an inclusive community and its core work to help those impacted by physical and mental disabilities participate in sports and recreational activities to enhance the lives of those who are differently abled. The nonprofit creates opportunities for children and adults with a wide range of abilities to participate in sports activities through adaptive tools and programming, removing the barriers that can make it difficult to play or engage within their community. The $25,000 Hometown Pride grant will help the organization to purchase additional sports wheelchairs, eliminating the high financial burden for those unable to participate without adaptive equipment, according to the organization. To date, Cenex has invested more than $475,000 in local organizations since the Hometown Pride grant initiative began in 2019.  Cenex is the energy brand of CHS Inc.

Dole is actively encouraging other companies with a presence in Hawaii to provide financial and other assistance to those impacted by the Maui fires and hopes its own donations can serve as an example for future efforts, the company stated.
