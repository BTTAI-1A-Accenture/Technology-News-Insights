The Department of Information and Communications Technology signed an agreement with telecom operators to establish a standardized connectivity rating system to elevate internet quality in the Philippines. It said the memorandum of understanding with Globe, PLDT, Smart, DITO and Converge exemplifies the collaborative drive of all stakeholders in pushing for inclusive national progress. “The benefits of having a nationwide benchmark for internet quality in a particular area could not be overstated. For businesses and public institutions, the Connectivity Index Rating will allow them to optimize their connectivity requirements based on the volume of user-traffic that they accommodate in their area,” DICT Secretary Ivan John Uy said. Uy said the Connectivity Index Rating would push businesses to innovate and invest in quality connectivity solutions that will increase brand recognition and expand their customer base. “More importantly, the Connectivity Index Rating is aligned with the directive of President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. to accelerate the digital transformation of the country by raising awareness on the availability, quality and consistency of internet connectivity in buildings used for public purposes,” he said. © All Rights Reserved, Newspaper Theme.
