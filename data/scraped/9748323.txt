Nebraska state senators will consider a bill Monday that will lay the framework for peer-to-peer vehicle-sharing programs.  Services like 'Turo' allow people to book vehicles from 'hosts'. LB 446 would ensure every trip is covered by state-mandated minimum insurance in Nebraska.  The bill would also require certain notice for vehicle owners that have liens attached, require certain records to be kept and imposes certain license requirements on the driver.  The Banking, Commerce and Insurance committee will hear testimony on the proposal when it meets at 1:30 p.m. Monday.
