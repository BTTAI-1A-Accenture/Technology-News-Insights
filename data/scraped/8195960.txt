 What is Circularity? Circularity is a system of production and consumption that focuses on reducing waste, increasing resource productivity, and promoting a circular economy. Circularity is a concept that involves designing products with the intention of reducing the waste they create at every stage of their life cycle. A circular economy is the antithesis of a linear economy, where resources are extracted from the earth and sent straight to landfill. It is based on the idea that we can create products and services designed with longevity in mind while also reducing our reliance on finite natural resources. Circularity in the built environment is about creating a new way of building with the circular materials that surround us. It is about designing products that can be reused, repaired, and recycled at the end of their useful lives. The circular economy and how it can be applied to the built environment The circular economy is a system in which waste is eliminated and resources are regenerated. It is an approach to resource management that focuses on closing loops to keep products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times. Introducing circularity in the construction industry begins with a transformation of the linear model into a circular one. Instead of extracting and wasting resources, the industry needs to adapt to building products that are reusable, repairable, and recyclable. Polycare Modular Building Technology drives this transformation toward circularity in the built environment. Polycare Approach to Circularity in the Built Environment We shift away from linear value chains and design regenerative new processes that push products designed for the future. The principles of Reuse, Recycle, and Repair guide us in everything we do. Production The production of the Polycare Modular Blocks does not require cement, and the geopolymers are made from secondary raw materials. Instead of using scare sand, other industrial waste products such as fly ash, foundry sands, slags, and other flowable materials are used as fillers. Overall, there are 80% fewer CO2 emissions than with conventional concrete. This paves the way for the construction industry to significantly reduce its carbon footprint. Designs The shift to design for disassembly is the most important paradigm shift needed today. Buildings should be modular and built in a way that allows the reuse of their components. We see a future of reuse and repair, creating new possibilities and unseen flexibility for future buildings to contribute to the circular economy. Polycare designs are customized through co-creation and standard designs off the shelf. Design is also made easier with our software Polybuilder, and every structure has its digital twin, which enables future deconstruction and reuse. Transportation Short transport routes due to local production and 70% less weight to be transported for a "house in a box"—everything you need on-site. Construction site No mortar or glue is needed because the blocks fit together like Legos. This allows for a short construction time and no emissions or waste on sites. In addition, there is no heavy machinery required on site. Re-usage Dismantling instead of demolishing buildings enables the reuse of the Polyblocks. This creates new revenue streams and a material bank. This in turn also reduces waste and the end of the lifecycle. Through these approaches, circularity is integrated into the building industry. Leading to material circularity and longevity instead of ending up in landfills.
