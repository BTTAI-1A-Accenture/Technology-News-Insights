Battery technology encompasses the design, development, and production of energy storage devices that convert chemical energy into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions. Batteries are crucial in a wide range of applications, from portable electronics like smartphones and laptops to electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage systems that facilitate the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. The most common types of batteries include lead-acid, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, and lithium-ion, with lithium-ion batteries being the most prevalent in modern applications due to their high energy density, low self-discharge, and long cycle life.
