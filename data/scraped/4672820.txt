The Toffees suffered a 3-1 loss at the hands of Manchester United in the FA Cup recently. Hence, they will be desperate to produce a much-improved display versus the Saints this weekend. Frank Lampard will probably opt for a 4-3-3 formation and could make some changes to his starting XI for this game. We can expect Dominic Calvert-Lewin to lead the line for the Merseyside club in the final third while Neal Maupay makes way for him and drops to the bench. Defence Jordan Pickford will function in goal for the Toffees after conceding three goals in his last appearance. Lampard could name a back three of Ben Godfrey, Conor Coady and James Tarkowski as they focus on keeping the opposition at bay throughout the game. All three of them need to defend their penalty box with conviction if Everton are to earn a clean sheet this weekend. Michael Keane is unlikely to recover in time for this game. However, Mason Holgate will provide cover for the centre-back positions on the bench. Goodison Park Midfield Idrissa Gueye and Amadou Onana will anchor the midfield for the Merseyside outfit as they try to make life difficult for the Saints at the centre of the park. Vitaliy Mykolenko will probably retain his spot on the left flank while Seamus Coleman tries to put in a hard-working performance as the right wing-back. Both of them need to be solid when defending at the back so that they can restrict the opposition attackers from creating too many opportunities from the wide areas. Abdoulaye Doucoure will be named on the bench as he waits for his chance to shine in the second 45 minutes if Lampard opts to call upon his services. Attack Demarai Gray will function as the left-sided wide player while Dwight McNeil hopes to catch the eye as the right-winger. Dominic Calvert-Lewin will lead the charge for Everton on the attacking end of the pitch. The English striker has to find a way to cause a few problems for the Southampton defenders this weekend. Neal Maupay will have to settle for a spot on the bench and might come on to make an impact in the latter stages of the game if needed.
