To further protect its customers in instances where their phones have been stolen, Digicel has announced that it is collaborating on an industry solution to block stolen phones from accessing all local mobile networks.  The move represents a significant step in an industry wide effort to prevent the sale of stolen phones. “The word here is that, very soon, stolen phones will no longer work on any network in Jamaica. We are enhancing this assurance by working diligently through collaboration with the Ministry of Science, Energy and Technology and industry stakeholders,” declared CEO of Digicel Jamaica Jabbor Kayumov. Already, Digicel customers are able to report loss or theft of their phones; however, the devices are only blocked on its network. By supporting a cross-network solution, stolen phones will be disabled and included in a national database that would prevent them from being reconnected to any network. “There is significant need for this now, considering that more robberies today involve the theft of a cellphone, with some incidents leading to injury and even death. This cannot be allowed to continue,” Kayumov remarked. In addition to cross-network blocking, Kayumov is urging smartphone users to download and use apps that may help to track their devices and protect their data in the event of phone theft. Above all, the Digicel CEO is urging persons to report all instances of phone theft to the police. HOUSE RULES
