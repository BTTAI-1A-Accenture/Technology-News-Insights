(PRESS RELEASE) MILAN, 10-Oct-2023 — /EuropaWire/ — Intesa Sanpaolo is continuing its process of adopting innovative artificial intelligence solutions, in line with the objectives of the Group’s digital transformation programme – guided by CEO Carlo Messina – set out in the 2022-2025 Business Plan. The Chief Institutional Affairs and External Communication Officer (CIAECO) Area, headed by Stefano Lucchini, has launched a new project, conceived by the Group Regulatory Evolution Agenda Department with the support of Deloitte Risk Advisory, to digitalise and evolve its operating model for setting the Group’s Regulatory Agenda. Intesa Sanpaolo thus becomes the first European bank to use artificial intelligence for regulatory analysis. Thanks to the collaboration with the Italian start-up Aptus.AI – the technology partner found to be the best fit among leading reg-tech companies worldwide – the Bank will evolve its operating model, making the Group’s regulatory agenda-setting processes more efficient and faster. This will help handle the growing volume of new national and international regulations, the analysis of their impact on activities, the identification of risk areas in correlation with the Group’s internal regulations and the automatic, customised creation of document collections for specific professional profiles. The Aptus.AI technology makes it possible to create a machine-readable version of digital documents that can be adapted to different types of text content. The new electronic format provides interactive access to regulatory data, saving time and aiding decision-making. The CIAECO Area was among the first to work in synergy with the Chief Data, AI, Innovation and Technology Area led by Massimo Proverbio in AI initiatives. In recent months, this collaboration led to the creation of Lisa (Linguistic Intelligence for Supervisory Awareness), a machine-learning tool designed by the Group Supervisory Strategic Steering Department to help read and quickly process thousands of publications on banking supervision. “The Regulatory Agenda has become an indispensable corporate governance tool in formulating the strategic choices of a Group like ours, which operates in various business sectors and markets,” commented Marcello Mentini, Executive Head of Group Regulatory Evolution Agenda. “We realised that our agenda-setting process needed to be strengthened. The support of artificial intelligence will allow our people to focus their work on high value-added analysis activities, and the collaboration with Aptus.Ai will enable us to contribute both to the digitalisation of the Group and to the growth of one of Italy’s best technology start-ups, supporting an excellent new local company.” Media Contact: Intesa Sanpaolo
