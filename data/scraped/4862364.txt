Civil Service United head coach Franco Ndawa has quit his job with eight months remaining on his two-year contract. The coach and Civo general secretary Ronald Chiwaula confirmed the development yesterday. Said Ndawa: “I sent my resignation letter to Civo management and they have accepted it. I am going to MDF where I have been assigned other duties.” However, he could not explain whether he will coach one of the four Malawi Defence Force (MDF) teams in the TNM Super League, saying he was not ready to disclose details of his duties. Chiwaula yesterday described Ndawa’s move as shocking. However, he said the former Nyasa Big Bullets and Mighty Mukuru Wanderers coach has left a legacy as one of their best coaches. “We have accepted his resignation with pain. However, we have to move on. We will greatly miss his services and we wish him all the best in his next endeavours,” Chiwaula said. He further said the club’s executive committee will next week decide Ndawa’s replacement. Ndawa joined Civo in 2018 on a three-year contract after the outfit replaced Epac FC upon relegation from the Super League in 2017. His contract was extended by two years in 2021 the side finished within the top eight brackets in the elite league. In the just-ended season, the Office of the President and Cabinet-sponsored outfit also finished eighth with 45 points, 23 behind eventual champions Nyasa Big Bullets.
