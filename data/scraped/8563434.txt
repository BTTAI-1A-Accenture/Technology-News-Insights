Twitter CEO Elon Musk, 51, had some bad blood with Taylor Swift fans Friday after he posted a series of bizarre tweets about the “Anti-Hero” singer. The string of tweets began with Musk’s reply to Dogecoin creator Billy Markus, 40, who tweeted about Swift. “taylor swift rules and if you disagree you’ll be kicked off the internet i’m pretty sure,” the bitcoin founder wrote. Musk responded, “Her limbic resonance skill is exceptional.” According to PsychMechanics, “limbic resonance” refers to “a state of deep emotional and physiological connection between two people.” The eccentric CEO later responded to a four-image collage tweeted from Swift’s official account, posting a simple cigarette emoji, which some users took to mean that Musk thinks the “Evermore” singer was “smoking” hot. In a third response, this time to a tweet asking if Musk and the 33-year-old singer would make a cute couple, Musk responded with a crying laughing emoji.  The Post reached out to Musk and Swift for comment. Many of Swift’s die-hard fans were seeing “Red,” with several telling Musk to “go to horny jail.” “GET A JOB STAY AWAY FROM HER YOU CREEP,” slammed one Swiftie. “Leave her alone,” tweeted another fan. “Don’t ever tweet to Taylor again,” threatened a third fan. Her limbic resonance skill is exceptional Other users were more accepting of Musk being a Swiftie. “You just want a break up song written about you, right,” laughed one user. “Taylor’s next album will now be titled ‘Mars,'” another person tweeted to the SpaceX founder. “Did you just shoot your shot my guy,” a third person said. The string of tweets came as Swift opened her highly anticipated, and expensive, Eras tour  this weekend in Glendale, Arizona.  Advertisement
