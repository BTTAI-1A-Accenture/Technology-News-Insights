Save to Favorites Are you passionate about  tech gadgets, phones and computers? Patient, knowledgeable, and compassionate volunteers are needed to help aging adults in our on-site Computer/Tech Lab. Volunteers assist older adults 1:1 with various devices, including desktops (in our lab), laptops, tablets and phones, on all operating systems.  Sample questions from older adults may include "How do I use email and how can I FaceTime and use social media with my grandchildren?", "How do I organize my photos?", "How do I use my new gadget?" and "How do I find or organize my files?" We are expanding our in-person hours in the near future. We are in immediate need of a volunteer for every Thur sday from 2-4 pm. We are  also in need of volunteers willing to  substitute when someone is on vacation.
