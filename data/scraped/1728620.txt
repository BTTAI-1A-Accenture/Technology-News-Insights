British Transport Police officers were called on December 7, 2022, after reports that human bones had been discovered. Specialist teams conducted a search of the scene and found the skeletal remains of one person, who is estimated to have been there for more than seven years. Following the results of a post-mortem exam and extensive forensic enquiries, officers have said they are now looking to identify the person so they can inform their family. The bones are believed to belong to a male who was at least 50 years of age and was likely to be white and 5ft 7in tall. Anthropological exams identified that the man could be from the UK, Europe, Indian Subcontinent, North Africa, or Middle East.  They were wearing size seven Hush Puppies shoes, dark brown trousers with a brown belt, a dark-coloured Henley and Knight Jacket, and a grey and black striped jumper. A 'New Zealand' keyring with a kiwi bird image on it and two Sekonda wrist watches were found in their possession at the scene in Brackley Park in Hull, East Yorkshire.  A British Transport Police spokesperson said: "Detectives are hoping someone might recognise these items and come forward to assist their investigation. While they continue to undertake further forensic work and missing person enquiries to identify him, how he came to be at the location, and how he died. Anyone with information is asked to contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 465 of 07/12/22."
