It's still just the all-weather meetings for Friday racing tips and they feature selections from Southwell and Kempton. talkSPORT have gone through the race cards and form so you don’t have to, with betting tips from all the racing across the UK. talkSPORT BET - Get up to £25 free bets PLUS 25 Free Spins - CLAIM HERE* Bang On The Bell has shown some good form of late and looks a great price to take on each-way but the main punt goes to Pockley at 7/2. Under Franny Norton the gelding won by a head at Newcastle in a Class 3 and comes back in class with 5lb claimer Mark Winn on board. Only up 2lb for that and has been close up on his last five appearances, all over 5f and 6f. As the bottom weight has a slight weight advantage that may play in his favour if he's continuing on the form of shown of late. A long-shot swinger, trifecta or exacta could include those two horses and La Roca Del Fuego who also seems to be a massive price considering his win at Chelmsford earlier this month. William Buick and Charlie Appleby combine on a promising looking two-year-old and the trainer's runners at Kempton can never really be ignored when he wins here 35% of the time out of 170 runners. This is a great price for a horse given a huge amount of weight in this competitive Class 2 race. Aidan Keeley takes another 5lb off too and this six-year-old has a 36% strike rate at this track and shouldn't be ignored to justify favouritism on that basis alone. May Sonic also loves it at Kempton with a slightly better win-rate at 38%, and as an 18/1 price could be a huge winner if Total Commitment can't make it to the line. He's down 9lb in the weights since last seen here over 6f in a Class 2 and could be really dangerous under a 7lb claimer taking even more crucial weight off.
