UTSA faculty and staff recently visited Los Angeles as part of a roadshow to strengthen relationships between higher education institutions with diverse student populations and employers in the film industry. AUGUST 11, 2023 — To strengthen relationships between higher education institutions with diverse student populations and employers in the film industry, the UTSA University Career Center recently hosted a roadshow in Los Angeles for members of the Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Career Collaborative, a consortium of 14 Hispanic Serving Institutions across the country with Latino-majority student populations. The roadshow created an opportunity for institutions in the collaborative to engage with high-demand employers. While there, senior leaders from the UTSA Career Center networked with employers such as Google, Riot Games, Nvidia, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, ActiveCampaign and Netflix, introduced them to its new Film Studies Program and advocated for UTSA graduates seeking to build careers in high-demand film industries. The networking opportunity further advances UTSA’s vision to become a Hispanic thriving institution.  Representatives from UTSA recently met with Netflix and other Los Angeles film leaders to introduce them to the university's new Film Studies Program and advocated for UTSA graduates seeking to build careers in high-demand film industries. Joshua Gutierrez has actively partnered with the UTSA University Career Center since his role as Google’s Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) outreach lead. He was instrumental in setting up the HSI Career Collaborative’s Los Angeles roadshow, which was hosted by Netflix, where he currently serves as the pathways engagement programs lead. While in Los Angeles, UTSA faculty members Sean Kelly (Interdisciplinary School for Engagement in the Humanities), Paul Ardoin (associate professor and director of the Film/Media Studies Program) and Guillermina Zabala Suarez (professor of practice in the Film/Media Studies Program) introduced employers to its Hispanic Student Film Incubator. Launched in fall 2022, the incubator is ensuring that students from all backgrounds are able to pursue great opportunities as filmmakers and content creators. The Los Angeles roadshow was the second in a series organized by the HSI Career Collaborative. In June, the Collaborative hosted a roadshow in Chicago, where members met with employers from various industries such as AbbVie, PepsiCo, John Deere, Constellation Brands and McDonald's Corp. to advocate for graduates in a variety of degree programs. “The HSI Career Collaborative has undertaken the initiative of organizing this roadshow with the aim of providing our esteemed member HSIs with an exceptional platform. This program serves as a unique opportunity for our members to engage with prominent employers in crucial markets, fostering valuable connections that benefit both UTSA and all HSIs,” said Mario Vela ’04, ’08, UTSA assistant vice provost of career-engaged learning. “The roadshow aims to facilitate not only employment prospects on behalf of our students and alumni but also the enrichment of curriculum offerings through these meaningful relationships. We are thankful to Joshua Gutierrez and Michael Orozco Jr., program manager of talent acquisition for strategic programs at Netflix, for their partnership and commitment to HSIs.”  UTSA's representatives were welcomed to Netflix HQ on Sunset Boulevard in the heart of Los Angeles. UTSA is currently organizing a roadshow in Washington, D.C. for the HSI Career Collaborative. It will be hosted this October by the federal government and attended by 200 federal agencies. While there, Vela will introduce the HSI Career Collaborative to the federal employers in attendance. The University Career Center supports students, alumni, employers and parents through resources and events that help all members of the UTSA community accomplish their career goals. It develops unique ways to engage with students and alumni to promote their skills and provides opportunities that support their career development. The employers and markets invited to participate in UTSA’s roadshows are identified with feedback from the University Career Center’s Student Advisory Board and student surveys. â
