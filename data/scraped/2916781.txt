It's been almost two years in the making for Jo-Lynn Pizzeria to open back up to make the town's favorite treat for people who love their pies. Customer Chelsi Swank said she had been "so excited. We have been waiting for this moment." â€œI live right next door, been waiting for it to open," Kathy Montanery, another customer said. It's a big deal for the locally-owned family business after a fire destroyed it back in June of 2021.Even through the tough times, the people of Liberty Borough kept the Staab family motivated to reopen the shop. "It was the community that kept us going. We had so much support from everybody," said Nicole Staab, manager and daughter of Jo-Lynn's owner. Crews were popping pizzas in the ovens on Liberty Way to please the crowds waiting outside for a slice. "There was a line around the parking lot," said Tammy Sever, another manager and daughter of the owner. The owner, Jodi Staab, says they've been "slinging pies" for decades, so this re-grand opening means so much. "I didn't realize how much we are family," Staab said. "I thought we were just a pizza shop and serving the community, but everyone came, and I just can't say thank you enough." And the hard work to get it back open honors her father who opened up the shop in 1972. "My dad started this, and I'm following in his footsteps, which I'm very proud to," Staab said. "He's just a wonderful man." The pizza shop closes at 9 p.m., with the grand re-opening going on until then.
