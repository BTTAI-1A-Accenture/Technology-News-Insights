Published  on By PlayStation Plus' February 2023 freebies have been leaked ahead of Sony's official announcement. It's common knowledge that, on an average month, Sony announces the next batch of games for its PlayStation Plus platform on the final Wednesday before the first Tuesday of the forthcoming month. If we're to go by this, then technically, the lineup for February should receive a formal announcement on the 1st. As it turns out, a credible source has already jumped ahead and leaked the next four freebies in full. The only issue is, as this is stemming directly from social media, it's easy to take everything with a grain of salt. That said, leaker “billbil-kun” has been on the money in the past, which leads us to believe that there is some level of plausibility here. Anyway, according to the source, subscribers of both the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers will receive the following games on the first Tuesday of February: As noted on the post, Mafia: Definitive Edition could be swapped out for another game closer to the announcement date. According to the source, this is down to the fact that Mafia will be region-locked, and will therefore need replacing. As for what it'll be is still a mystery, though. Either way, PlayStation will be lifting the veil on the lineup over the next few days. You will be able to get a hold of the above games between February 7th and March 6th. Also, don't forget that the following games will only be available until the 7th:   So, what do you make of the latest freebies? Let us know over on our socials here or down in the comments below.
