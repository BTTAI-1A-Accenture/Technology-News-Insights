Despite a troubling elbow injury threatening another possible Tommy John surgery, current Halos superstar Shohei Ohtani had some encouraging news shared through his agent about his status for next season.  Though one side of his game has surely been affected on the mound, whatever team signs Ohtani to their roster can expect the unicorn to have appearances at the plate in his normal DH role next season. Much speculation has been held on the status for Ohtani's elbow after a tear in his UCL was discovered in what ended up being his final start for the Angels in 2023.  Hearing that his graft is still intact is a great sign for his two-way future as many doubted he would ever pitch again.  Knowing that he will not only return to hitting, but also the mound in the near future for any franchise he decides to suit up for will be a joy for baseball fans everywhere.  Anaheim might not be where Ohtani continues this greatness though, as the Angels haven't fielded a playoff team in his seven years with the franchise.  Though Ohtani had his first Tommy John surgery after his 2018 Rookie of the Year campaign, he still returned to hit and pitch full time in 2020 with the former aspect of his game continuing in 2019.  One of, if not, the best hitters in the league, even if Ohtani doesn't receive the record breaking contract he was projected to get for both his pitching and abilities at the plate, he should still get paid handsomely wherever he goes.  Many suitors have already supposedly lined up to sign the Japanese unicorn and the Angels are one of them.  If this is truly it for Ohtani as a Halo, his tenure with the franchise certainly won't be forgotten as one of the greatest MLB has ever seen to begin his time in the show.  Caleb is a recent graduate of Cal Poly Pomona with his B.S in Communications through Multimedia Journalism.
