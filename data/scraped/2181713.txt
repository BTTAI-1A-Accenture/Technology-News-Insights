Ola’s first electric car is intended to have over 500km range on a single charge. Published On Jun 15, 2023 03:09:00 PM 32,357 Views    By Saptarshi Mondal Share -             It’s been a while since there's been any news of Indian EV start-up Ola Electric's upcoming EV four-wheeler, but a leaked patent image now gives us a first look at its complete design. The car, as seen in the image, is likely in the concept stage and has visual ties to previous teasers, although the final production-spec model's looks could differ. Let’s take a closer look. A first glance at the design of Ola's EV four-wheeler reveals a rather minimalistic design language with the overall shape resembling the Tesla Model S and Model 3. It’s a traditional sedan silhouette with a coupe-like roofline at the rear. The body panels are rounded and smoothened, perhaps to aid aerodynamic efficiency, while the wheels are pushed out towards the edges, thereby increasing its wheelbase and helping Ola package a larger battery. As is typical to EVs, there’s no grille, but the smoothened front bumper makes up the entire fascia with a couple of air intakes on either side. The headlamp assembly is right above the bumper and comprises sleek, horizontal lamps at either end connected via what will likely be an LED light bar. Previous teasers have hinted at stacked horizontal blocks for the LED Daytime Running Lamps, with the light bar stretching the entire width of the car. The bonnet also features some gentle sculpturing. In profile, there seems to be a prominent air vent aft of the front fender and a scooped front door with flush door handles, with the car likely featuring cameras instead of traditional wing mirrors. The window line appears pinched at both ends, and it also gets dual-tone aero-optimised wheels. The patent image also suggests a dual-tone effect for the roof with previous teasers even hinting at a full glass roof. There’s, however, no glimpse of the rear styling yet. Interestingly, Ola has previously shown various details through a series of online teasers, the last of which even depicted a high-riding crossover. At this stage, therefore, it’s unclear whether there will be one or multiple body styles. Ola had also teased the interior of its upcoming four-wheeler, which showed an octagonal, two-spoke steering wheel with haptic controls, a free-standing digital instrument cluster and a massive, landscape-oriented touchscreen with a floating design at the centre. The teaser hinted at a very minimalist design that will likely be devoid of physical controls. You can read more about it here. Technical details on Ola’s upcoming electric car remain scant for now, but it will likely employ a 70-80kWh battery pack with a range of over 500km. The brand has previously also said that it's aiming for a sub-4 second 0-100kph sprint time and a drag coefficient of 0.21Cd. The EV will also get assisted driving capabilities and keyless and handleless doors, and will be powered by Ola's in-house MoveOS software. The car is due in 2024 and we know that Ola is not targeting the budget segment. It is instead going premium with its first electric car, with a starting price that's likely upwards of Rs 25 lakh.
