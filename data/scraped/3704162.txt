Search Share    Narvik, Norway-based aquaculture technology firm Probotic has created a hole-detection system designed to prevent salmon escapes. Its Hole Detection System performs daily automated net-pen inspections, with its detection and analysis capabilities augmented by artificial intelligence. "We are thrilled to show how our innovative Hole Detection system works for the fish farming industry,” Probotic CEO Mikkel Pedersen said in a press release. “By combining AI and automation, we are revolutionizing how fish pen nets are inspected and maintained, ultimately contributing to a safer and healthier future for the industry and consumers." The system was developed in partnership with Ballangen Sjøfarm and was funded by the Norwegian Fisheries and Aquaculture Industry Research Fund. Peterdsen said the hole-detection system will be integrated with Probotic's autonomous underwater robot, Probot, to perform daily net inspections and provide real-time alerts on detected holes. Probotic recently completed a study with Akvaplan Niva, Ballangen Sjøfarm, and Cermaq, showing  Probot use had no adverse effects on fish mortality or appetite compared to traditional net-cleaning methods using highly pressurized water. "We have overcome some of the biggest potential challenges for the system and are now scaling testing also including new fish farmers," Pedersen said. "We are also preparing for a commercial pilot later this year, which we hope will enable us to bring our technology to the market and revolutionize how we clean and inspect fish pen nets."
