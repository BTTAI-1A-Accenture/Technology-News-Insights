Aiyuk finished with a modest fantasy line as quarterback Brock Purdy spread the ball around to all of his star playmakers in the blowout victory. Aiyuk's 58 receiving yards wound up being the game high for wideouts from either team Sunday and ranked only behind tight end George Kittle, who had 67 yards to go along with his three touchdown grabs. The fourth-year receiver is now averaging 97.5 yards over four active games this season after gaining 59.7 per game during his breakout campaign last year. Aiyuk and the undefeated 49ers will head out on the road in Week 6 to face the Browns next Sunday. Â© 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. All Rights Reserved.
