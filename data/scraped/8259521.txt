Hollywood Casino at Greektown to Open Market Express with Amazon Technology Hollywood Casino at Greektown has unveiled Market Express, a new grab-and-go market powered by Amazonâs Just Walk Out technology and Amazon One, marking the debut of both technologies in Detroit. Located in the propertyâs casual dining Monroe Market food hall, the new in-casino mini market enables visitors to purchase what they want without having to stop to checkout. To enter Hollywood Casino at Greektownâs new 400-square-foot Market Express, guests simply insert their credit card or hover their palm over an Amazon One device at the entry gates and begin shopping. As they make their selections of snacks and refreshments, Amazonâs Just Walk Out technology determines what they take from, or return to, the store shelves. Upon exit, the credit card they inserted at the entry gate or linked to their Amazon One ID will be charged for the items they took. The technology is designed to offer an effortless and convenient retail experience, free from check-out lines. To sign up to Amazon One, interested shoppers can enroll at an Amazon One device kiosk located outside the store. âAt Hollywood Casino at Greektown, the customer experience is at the heart of everything we do, so being able to offer this innovative, convenient and seamless retail experience for our guests is certainly a win,â says John Drake, general manager of Hollywood Casino at Greektown. âWeâre thrilled to work with Amazon to bring this cutting-edge technology to Detroiters for the first time.â Dilip Kumar, vice president at AWS Applications, says: âHollywood Casino at Greektown wanted to provide a place in Monroe Market for guests to grab their refreshments as quickly and easily as possible, so itâs been a very fitting collaboration for us. Hollywood Casino at Greektown is firmly focused on enhancing customer experience, particularly in busy areas of the venue, and weâre excited for guests to enjoy Amazonâs Just Walk Out technology and Amazon One during their stay.â Credit Unions in Maryland, Texas, Illinois Implement Bankjoy Platform Bankjoy, a Detroit-based digital banking provider, announced that three credit unions implemented its business banking platform to provide their business members with a best-in-class digital banking experience.

Pistons Owner Tom Gores to Provide 10K+ Toys, Bicycles, Tablets to Michigan Families Thanks to a generous contribution from Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores, more than 10,000 toys, bicycles, and tablets will be distributed to families in Detroit, Flint, and surrounding neighborhoods this holiday season. U.S. Marines and volunteers of the Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program will host a special gift event for families and children in Detroit today while Voices for Children will be coordinating a similar event in Flint on Dec. 15.Â  Gores is also supporting The Salvation Army Downriver Corps with an additional $25,000 donation. Tricycles with helmets will be gifted to all children under three. Children ages 4-7 will receive bicycles with helmets. Youth ages 8-10 will receive drones and those ages 11-13 will receive tablets. âAll children should experience the joy of receiving gifts during the holiday season,â Gores says. âThereâs nothing better than children smiling and experiencing real joy. We started doing this many years ago and Iâm pleased that we continue to help families during this special time of year. We are excited and honored to partner with these great organizations that are doing important work for Michigan youth.â Gores and his wife Holly support a number of Detroit-area causes focused on improving the quality of life for families in need and contributing to the revitalization of the region and the state.Â  They both grew up in the area and quietly have supported holiday toy distributions across Michigan since 2006 and delivered more than 145,000 gifts to families, according to a spokesperson for Gores. The Gores familyâs partnership with Toys for Tots began in 2009 and has delivered more than 125,000 toys to more than 60,000 children. Prior to aligning with Toys for Tots, Gores supported similar gift-giving programs through other organizations. After supporting the programs as a âSecret Santaâ for seven years, Gores agreed in 2013 to be identified in order to encourage others to join in with contributions of their own. âFinding a present under the tree on Christmas morning is an experience every child deserves,â says Ted Silvester, a retired Marine colonel who is vice president of the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation. âTom and Holly Gores have certainly gone above and beyond to help us bring that joy to children whose families have suffered so much. This has been an especially difficult year to raise support and collect toys, so Tom and Hollyâs effort in support of the Marine Toys for Tots programs in Michigan will fulfill the Christmas holiday dreams of thousands of less fortunate children who otherwise might have been forgotten.â Royal Park Hotel in Rochester Rolls Out Holiday Specials The Royal Park Hotel in Rochester is offering festive favorites again this holiday season, including its nationally recognized Buddy the Elf-inspired suite in partnership with Makerâs Mark.
