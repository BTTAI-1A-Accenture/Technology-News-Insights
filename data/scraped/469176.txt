 Stocks, also known as shares, are units of ownership in a company that provide the opportunity for investors to make a profit if the company’s share price rises. With inflation hitting a 40-year high of over 10% last year, it’s become increasingly challenging for investors to achieve inflation-beating returns from their money. And while interest rates are more appealing for savers than a year ago, money held in savings accounts is still losing value in real terms each year. As a result, investors are looking to equity investments in their quest for above-inflation returns, with shares potentially able to deliver significantly higher average returns than cash over the long term. That said, investing in shares is also higher risk with the potential to lose, as well as make, money. Although some shares have delivered eye-catching gains, others have languished in the red with investors suffering substantial losses. To help investors navigate through the options, we asked our panel of experts which stocks are worthy of consideration and why. Their choices are set out below (in alphabetic order) and span a range of industry and geographic sectors, as well as large-cap and smaller-cap companies. Meanwhile, our FAQs section takes a closer look at investing in shares. Featured Partner Offer 1 eToro Invest in global and local stocks with ZERO commission *Other fees apply.

 Booking Holdings is a leading provider of online travel services, listed on the Nasdaq and headquartered in the United States. The company operates in more than 220 countries under a range of brands including Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Rentalcars.com, KAYAK and OpenTable. Booking Holdings aims to deliver a ‘connected trip’ experience by offering customers a ‘one-stop shop’ for flight, car rental, hotel and restaurant bookings. It’s also developing its capability to automatically reschedule reservations, for example, hotel and restaurant bookings after flight delays. Rob Burgeman, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, comments: “Booking Holdings is the global leader in online travel reservation (measured by revenue), operating in an oligopoly [a market with a small number of firms] alongside Expedia and AirBnB in developed markets. “While cyclical in nature, the company captures several longer-term trends: increasing penetration of online travel reservations, expanding middle class in emerging economies and the rise in alternative accommodation.” Although the slowdown in consumer spending is likely to impact the travel sector, the company’s ‘value’ brands should retain their appeal to cost-conscious travellers. Mr Burgeman adds: “A population starved of travel opportunities following the outbreak of Covid are embracing some of the options now available to them and this would look to support Bookings Holdings for several years to come.” £0.87

 Centamin is a gold mining company, quoted on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in Jersey. The company has mining operations in Egypt and Cote d’Ivoire, together with exploration activities at different stages of progression in Egypt, the Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Its flagship asset, the Sukari Gold Mine in Egypt, started production almost 15 years ago and aims to produce 500,000 ounces of gold a year. However, the mine suffered setbacks in 2020, with output falling due to subsidence and other issues. Unsurprisingly, this had a knock-on effect on Centamin’s share price, which halved in value. Having mounted somewhat of a recovery in the second half of last year, the share price has continued to slide this year as falling earnings per share failed to impress investors. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, comments: “The Egyptian gold miner has struggled with legal challenges since Covid, but with signs of progress on that front and a solid outlook for gold prices, it seems there is a more optimistic outlook in store.” However, given the company’s fortunes are heavily tied to gold prices, investors should expect volatility along the way. Gold is currently trading at near-record prices so it remains to be seen whether demand for the shiny metal will hold firm. £4.35

 easyJet is an airline and package holiday provider, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in the UK. Unsurprisingly, easyJet was hit hard by the pandemic travel restrictions, with its share price still trading at a third of its pre-pandemic high of more than £12. However, the company has gradually restored normal operations, with capacity expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of September.  The company’s half-year results revealed another pre-tax loss, however, there were encouraging signs elsewhere.  Ancillary revenue increased by more than 80% year-on-year, with passengers spending more money on baggage, seat reservations and on-board services. And it reported strong growth in the package holidays business, which is expected to hit the milestone of annual profit before tax of £100 million earlier than forecast. However, it hasn’t all been clear skies for the airline operator. James Lowen, co-manager of the JO Hambro UK Equity Income Fund, comments: “Several factors continue to hold back the full recovery of the airline sector, from staff shortages to delays in equipment delivery.  “But recovery is still pushing forward and traffic should be back to pre-Covid levels by 2025. Fare revenue is as good as it has ever been, while ancillary revenue is nearly double what it was pre-pandemic and is expected to continue to grow.” Looking ahead, the company hopes that redeploying aircraft to its more profitable routes to Portugal and the Greek islands will continue to boost earnings. The holidays arm is also aiming to expand into Europe, starting with Switzerland, France and Germany. That said, the company may face mounting headwinds as rising interest rates reduce disposable incomes. Investors will be hoping that the company continues to deliver against expectations despite a mixed outlook. £3.15

 Haleon is a consumer healthcare company that was spun out of GSK in mid-2022. It’s headquartered in the UK and listed on the London Stock Exchange. The company is a leading global provider of healthcare products, covering oral health, pain relief and respiratory and digestive health. Some of its best-known brands include Panadol, Voltarol, Sensodyne and Centrum, and it operates in more than 100 countries. RBC Brewin Dolphin’s Rob Burgeman comments: “Within its operating arena, there are high barriers to entry (whether through regulation or through distribution ties) and almost two-third of its categories enjoy large ‘competitive moats’. “It has pricing power – premium products tend to be more resilient to inflation – and also is more innovative than its peers, spending substantially more on research and development.” Mr Burgess highlights the company’s relatively high levels of debt, following the demerger, but believes that its robust cashflow should help to reduce this. Haleon has achieved strong growth in its share price since the demerger and demand for its products is likely to be fairly resilient in an economic downturn. It may therefore benefit from the increase in investor appetite for more defensive companies. £59.76

 InterContinental Hotels is a global hospitality company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in the UK. The company operates around 6,000 mid-range and luxury hotels in over 100 countries, the majority of which are in the Americas, followed by Europe and Asia. It manages hotels on behalf of third-party owners and franchises its brands, including Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Six Senses. Although the pandemic lockdowns took their toll on InterContinental’s earnings, the company’s share price has recovered strongly to recently hit an all-time high. It’s also delivered growth in occupancy levels and revenue per available room, despite inflationary cost pressures. IHG is a cash-generative business and has returned excess funds to shareholders in the form of dividends and a share buyback program. A potential headwind is the slowdown in consumer spending on discretionary items such as travel, however, IHG expects demand to be more resilient due to their focus on a higher-income customer base. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, comments: “The reopening of the Chinese economy should provide a fresh boost for economies in Asia, and release pent-up demand that should drive revenue for the group, helping to provide some much-needed growth as recession fears loom.” £7.81

 Keller is a specialist geotechnical contractor, and is listed on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in the UK. Clive Beagles, co-manager of JO Hambro’s UK Equity Income Fund, comments: “Keller is the world’s largest ‘geotechnical’ specialist contractor. It does things like put piles in the ground to form the foundations of buildings.” Over 60% of the company’s revenue comes from North America, followed by around a quarter from Europe and the remainder from Asia and the Middle East. Sector-wise, revenue is split (more or less) equally across the infrastructure and public buildings, power and industrial, residential and commercial sectors. While the economic outlook may be more challenging for the residential sector, the company has recently secured contracts for The Line project in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. This cutting-edge smart city aims to accommodate nine million people in a space of just 34 square kilometers. Mr Beagles comments: “Keller is expected to do well from infrastructure required for onshoring and decarbonisation. It is working on three liquified natural gas terminals in the Gulf of Mexico and expects £130 million in sales for the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia.”  In terms of share price, it’s been somewhat of a mixed bag over the past few years but investors have been rewarded with total returns of nearly 20% over the last year. It’s also currently trading on a dividend yield of 5% which may appeal to income-seekers. $64

 PayPal is a digital payment platform, which is listed on the Nasdaq and headquartered in the US. The company is the largest global online payment provider with a market share of more than 40%, according to Statista. PayPal has 400 million active consumer accounts, 35 million merchant accounts and processes $1.4 trillion of payments a year. In addition to its core business, recent initiatives include the roll out of its ‘tap to go’ Venmo app for merchants, in addition to a long-term strategic partnership with travel services provider Booking.com. Having hit an all-time high of more than $300 in 2021, the company’s share price has been languishing under $100 for most of the last 18 months. Sam North, market analyst at eToro, comments: “PayPal is trading at levels we saw in 2017, but the downside feels exhausted and if we trade back to the highs of August 2022, it would be a roughly 75% return.” Looking ahead, the company faces increasing competition from the likes of Amazon, Apple and Alphabet in the payment space. Inflation may also prompt a squeeze on consumer spending, which could hit PayPal’s transaction volumes. Mr North adds: “Yes, the share price has been battered, but they now have a new CEO who might be able to turn their fortunes around.  “They have diverse growth across their payment platform and, with the stock at 17 times earnings, it has never been this cheap.” $103

 PDD is a multinational e-commerce company, which is listed on Nasdaq as an American Depository Receipt (ADR). ADRs are US dollar denominated certificates that track the price of an overseas company’s shares. The company recently moved its headquarters from Shanghai to Ireland. PDD is China’s third largest e-commerce company by revenue, behind only Alibaba and JD.com. It started off as a discount retailer before expanding into the delivery of fresh produce from farmers to customers. The company’s Pinduoduo retail platform allows ‘social shopping’ where customers can join together to secure group discounts. While its Temu shopping app is targeted at overseas markets, and the US in particular. eToro’s Sam North comments: “Their latest results show PDD is taking market share from both Alibaba and JD. It’s one to watch and momentum is on its side. Separately, China is trying to stimulate its economy through reductions in tax on stock trading and the lowering of interest rates.  “PDD has managed to trend higher recently despite the obstacles China has had in the last year, giving confidence that the best is yet to come.” Mr North adds: “We have broken a multi-year trendline that dates back to its all-time-high in 2021, and, in my opinion, the share price has lots of room to go higher. Revenue is up by 66% with net income up 47% too.” The company has delivered the highest returns amongst our group by some margin, rewarding investors with a total return of 450% over the last five years. However, investors should be aware that the level of disclosure is lower than for public companies in the UK. €248

 Rheinmetall is a provider of automotive and security solutions, listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and headquartered in Germany. The company focuses on the defence and automotive sectors, providing vehicle and electronic security systems, weapons and vehicle components. It operates in 33 countries across Europe, Asia and the Americas. Rheinmetall’s share price has delivered stellar returns over the last year, with investor appetite boosted by a 50% increase in profit (EBIT) and strong cash flow generation. IG’s Chris Beauchamp comments: “The demands of the war in Ukraine mean that defence spending has rocketed up the agenda in Europe. “Now that more equipment is being sent east, European nations will have to boost their own capabilities, as well as replacing what they have already sent. The recent discussions around sending Leopard tanks, produced by Rheinmetall, illustrates the need for more equipment, which will help boost earnings.” However, it’s worth noting the potential risk around military contracts, with the German government raising concerns over the failure rate of Puma tanks in training exercises last year. That said, Rheinmetall has recently announced further contracts for the supply of Lynx and Puma tanks to the US and Germany respectively. £7.11

 Standard Chartered is an international banking provider, listed on the London and Hong Kong stock exchanges and headquartered in the UK. The company provides corporate and retail banking services, in addition to investment banking and a ‘ventures’ arm which includes two digital banks. Almost 90% of revenue is generated from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. JO Hambro’s James Lowen comments: “Over a third of its assets are in China, followed by Singapore and Korea. Like other banks, it is benefiting from higher interest rates while steering its business to less capital-intensive revenue streams, such as wealth management.” Standard recently reported half-year revenues that were ahead of expectations, and upgraded its near-term guidance. The company expects to benefit if the reopening of the Chinese economy gains momentum, although it remains cautious over possible impairment charges in the Chinese real estate market. The company’s share price rose at the start of the year on the back of takeover rumours but dipped when no formal suitor was forthcoming. Since then, the share price has steadily recovered to reward shareholders with a total return of more than 25% over the last year. Standard recently announced a 50% increase in its interim dividend, together with an additional $1 billion share buyback programme. In terms of outlook, Standard expects strong growth in Asian markets including India, Hong Kong and Singapore. In addition, Mox and Trust, its two digital banks, are also forecast to be profitable by 2025. Looking forward, Mr Lowen points to a forecast price-earnings ratio of under five times, which may appeal to investors looking to add banking exposure to their portfolio.  Featured Partner Offer 1 eToro Invest in global and local stocks with ZERO commission *Other fees apply.

The value of your investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you put in. Read More Shares, also called ‘stocks’, are units of ownership in a company and are issued by companies to raise funds. Shares in publicly-traded companies are available to buy and sell on stock exchanges, such as London or New York. One of the most popular ways to buy shares is via an online trading platform. Shares can be bought using a general trading account, or a tax-efficient wrapper such as an individual savings account (ISA) or self-invested personal pension (SIPP). It’s worth comparing the fees charged by the platform, as these can vary significantly. We’ve compared the fees, along with other information, in our pick of the best trading platforms, best stocks and shares ISA providers and best SIPP providers. Most trading platforms offer the option to trade European and US shares, although a higher trading fee is typically charged. Investors may also be charged a foreign exchange fee of around 0.5% to 1.0% of the value of the purchase. Holding non-UK shares also carries foreign exchange risk. For example, if the pound strengthens against the dollar, US shares will be worth less in their sterling equivalent. Funds are a low-cost way of investing in a ready-made portfolio of assets including equities, bonds and commodities. Funds pool money from investors to be invested by a fund manager, and are split into with two main types: There’s a wide range of options for investing in equity funds, including index funds, UK funds and US funds.
