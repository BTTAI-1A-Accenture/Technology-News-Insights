The break was traced to a transmission main on 24 Mile Road near North Avenue in Macomb Township.“It sounded like a raging river,” one homeowner told WJBK-TV (Channel 2).Within a few hours, GLWA crews were able to isolate the break and restore water pressure.But the problems continued to escalate as another break took place on Romeo Plank Road between 22 Mile and 23 Mile roads.

A number of area restaurants and other businesses were forced to close for the day due to a lack of water, while water was being blamed for flooding low-lying sections such as Bello Woods Golf Course.Earliest advisory could be lifted is ThursdayIn an afternoon update, the GLWA said its service crews and their contractors were able to bypass the break by switching the customers over to a 42-inch transmission main. That main runs runs parallel to the damaged pipe, which officials say is a prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) that was put into service in 1973.The authority expected to conduct the first of two rounds of water quality testing Tuesday afternoon and each round takes about 24 hours to process.

(DAVE ANGELL — FOR THE MACOMB DAILY)Employees at the Macomb Township offices handed out free bottled water on Tuesday afternoon and plan to do again from 9 a.m.-noon Wednesday. One case of bottled water per household will be available at the front entrance of the town hall, 54111 Broughton Road. Residents must bring an identification card.“I have heard all the local stores have run dry,” said Macomb Township Supervisor Frank Viviano. “That always happen when there’s a lack of water. People go out buying what they think they’ll need to get by for a few days.”In Chesterfield Township, a similar scene was in play at a fire station as firefighters were giving out cases of water to residents. Township officials said residents were lined up around the fire station as they waited for their turn to receive a case of water.The mandatory boiling advisory covers an estimated 156,000 people who reside in four Macomb County communities, along with eastern Rochester in neighboring Oakland County.  Those include Chesterfield Township, Lenox Township, Macomb Township and New Haven.Residents of Shelby Township experiencing low water pressure should also follow the advisory, officials said.Under the mandatory advisory, residents should not drink the water without boiling it first. Bring the water to a boil for at least one minute and then let it cool before using. Boiled, bottled, or disinfected water should be used for drinking, making ice, washing dishes, brushing teeth, and preparing food until further notice.Road repairs expected to last at least two weeksMeanwhile, the Macomb County Department of Roads has closed two roads for up to two weeks so the water main can be repaired. The closures include 24 Mile between North Avenue and Fairchild Road and Romeo Plank Road between 22 Mile and 23 Mile roads.“Here it is, summer construction season and we’ve added two new closures,” Viviano said. “People are going to have practice a little more patience than normal while driving around here.”Road officials said the 24 Mile closure is expected to reopen August 16, once repair work is completed.By late Tuesday afternoon, DPW crews were working to pump water out of the holes so they could begin the repair process.Whenever a water system loses pressure for any significant length of time, precautionary measures are recommended since a loss of pressure can lead to bacterial contamination in the water system. Bacteria are generally not harmful and are common throughout the environment. Boiling water before using it will kill bacteria and other organisms that may be in the water.Related Articles
