BetterUp has launched BetterUp Sales Performance on Salesforce AppExchange and integrated its platform for sales coaching and measuring the impact coaching is having on business outcomes with Salesforce. Additionally, BetterUp and Salesforce customers will soon have access to a dashboard embedded into Salesforce that measures revenue-related metrics driven by coaches and non-coached sales representatives. Integrating with Sales Cloud, features of BetterUp Sales Performance include the following: "Salesforce is one of the first adopters of the Human Transformation Platform and remains committed to the importance of mental fitness, inclusion, and connection," said Alexi Robichaux, CEO and co-founder of BetterUp, in a statement. "With our expanded partnership, sales managers and sellers using Sales Cloud will now have support to strategize on deals, prep for prospect calls, and develop the right mindsets around resilience, focus, and agility. We're thrilled to bring this solution to Salesforce customers to help them achieve and exceed sales performance." "BetterUp's Sales Performance is a welcome addition to AppExchange as it powers transformation for customers by unlocking team performance across sales organizations," said David Lee, vice president of product management for Salesforce AppExchange, in a statement. "AppExchange is constantly evolving to connect customers with the right apps and experts for their business needs." Salesforce and BetterUp have been partners since 2017, with BetterUp providing coaching to more than 70,000 Salesforce employees worldwide. Salesforce Ventures is also an investor in BetterUp. destinationCRM.com is dedicated to providing Customer Relationship Management product and service information in a timely manner to connect decision makers and CRM industry providers now and into the future.
