She said, “O-O-O-O’Reilly.” A newlywed Missouri couple has became a literal overnight sensation on TikTok after having the O’Reilly Auto Parts music sung by the original performing artists — with voiceover about replacing car batteries and all — moments after tying the knot last Saturday during their reception in Springfield. “I don’t know why everybody doesn’t sing the O’Reilly jingle at their wedding,” bride Patti Crump Lemons told The Post from Paris on her honeymoon. But for Crump Lemons, 51, and her husband Nick Sibley, 69, the catchy tune heard on radios across the nation is much more personal for them. Sibley — a musician by trade — composed the music in the 1980s and his wife is a video producer for the auto parts giant. They’ve gotten to know each other on the job for years. Original voice cast of the @O’Reilly Auto Parts jingle reunite at a wedding. You can’t make this stuff up. 😂 #oreillyautoparts #oreilly #jingle #ozarkmountaindaredevils  “Our friends and family didn’t really know what we did for our day jobs. So we’re like, well, let’s just show them and we were all excited,” she said. Recruiting the musical talent was an easy ask. They were already attending the wedding as friends of the bride and groom. “We just said, ‘Hey, we need to do an O’Reilly skit at the wedding.’ They just laughed about it and then we just kind of did it, impromptu,” Crump Lemons said. “That wasn’t part of my dream wedding when I was a little girl.” But it didn’t take her long to get into the spirit of things. With a bullhorn in hand — as a way of “doing talk back” like in the studio — Crump Lemons directed the musicians for 10 minutes of alternate, wacky takes of the theme as weddinggoers sat in the hilarity. “I think most people just thought it was quirky and silly, but that’s just kind of the people that we are,” she said. While on their honeymoon, the couple learned that they’re now viral stars. “We just kind of got caught wind of it here in Paris. Somebody called us here [saying it was] on TikTok [and it] was getting a bunch of views,” Sibley told The Post. “You try to do something like that on purpose and you couldn’t do it.” While soaking it all in, the bride is still bewildered by the overwhelming support her stunt has gotten. “I’m shocked today that many people want to view something like that,” Crump Lemons said. “There were a lot of fun moments that day and that was just the icing on the cake.” Advertisement
