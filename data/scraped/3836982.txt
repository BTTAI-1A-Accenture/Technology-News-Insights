 Contamination poses a huge risk to electronic products during the manufacturing process. If electronic products become contaminated it can lead to complete failure of the device, unreliable products, and low-quality products. This could cost manufacturers millions of pounds each year, and even the loss of their ISO certification.  This means that when manufacturing electronic products and components, cleanliness is integral to the manufacturing process. Electronic cleanrooms are used during the most critical stages of the electronics manufacturing process. Electronics cleanrooms are designed to comply with strict cleanliness standards to ensure complete sterility of the electronics manufacturing environment.  Here is a quote from Power Electronics News, always maintaining a mission critical project mindset... Read the full article here. It is extremely important to limit the exposure of pollutants from entering the manufacturing and cleanroom environment. The staff in your facility are one of the biggest contributors to contamination, producing up to 100,000 particles per minute like hair, skin particles, and fingerprints.  Also, make sure to...   The electronics industry extensively relies on contamination control mats to ensure optimal contamination control throughout the manufacturing process. It is crucial for facilities to implement a comprehensive strategy. One key aspect of this strategy should be finding effective ways to minimise contamination at the floor level.  Electronic cleanrooms and manufacturing facilities battle to control contamination at the floor level, as most of it enters through shoes and wheels. To address this, Dycem offers polymeric mats and flooring with superior contamination control properties. Our polymeric mats and flooring have a natural tack, antimicrobial properties, and high surface energy, allowing them to attract, capture, and retain up to 99.9% of contamination from shoes and wheels, and up to 75% of airborne contamination.  If you think Dycem's Contamination Control flooring and mats could help you, please get in touch - contact@dycem.com.
