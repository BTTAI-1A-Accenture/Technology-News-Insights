 1+ million worldwide  Fidelity Cash Management Account holders get fee-free access to any ATM with a Visa, Plus or Star logo by using their Visa-branded Fidelity debit card. If you are charged a fee by the ATM provider, Fidelity will reimburse you the amount of the fee on the same day it was debited (though you may be charged a 1% foreign transaction fee for an ATM withdrawal in another country). Fidelity charges no monthly fees for its CMA, and it does not have a minimum deposit requirement to open the account. The mobile app offers a number of convenient transaction options, including free mobile check deposit and free bill pay, making this an excellent option for account holders on the go. Fidelity also provides unlimited check writing—with real paper checks—for customers who are a little more old school. Fidelity’s APY is 2.72%, making it competitive with other CMAs. And the brokerage offers some optional features unlike what you’ll find in other cash management accounts. For instance, Fidelity’s optional Cash Manager feature allows you to set up maximum and minimum target balances, as well as a minimum transfer amount and a hierarchical listing of your funding accounts. When your CMA hits the maximum target balance, Fidelity will alert you so that you can move the excess money to another account or invest it. Fidelity also offers the optional Full View, which allows you to see all of your online financial accounts in a single, customizable dashboard on any device, including your mobile phone. Read our Fidelity Cash Management Account Review and our investing team’s Fidelity Investments Review. The Fidelity app gives customers full access to their accounts and allows you to complete any standard transaction, from paying bills to investing, from your mobile device.

 55,000+  Aspiration is a socially conscious investment platform that focuses on environmental sustainability. Aspiration Spend & Save provides a debit card, access to 55,000+ free in-network ATMs and the reassurance that your deposits will not fund fossil fuel production. Aspiration offers two accounts: the basic Aspiration Spend & Save and Aspiration Plus. If you opt for the basic account, Aspiration only asks you to “Pay What Is Fair” for your monthly maintenance fee. This means you can set your fee as low as $0 if you choose, although the platform encourages account holders to truly consider what they think is fair. With the basic Spend & Save account, you can earn 1.00% APY on balances up to $10,000 (which goes down to 0% APY for balance portions above $10,000), so long as you spend at least $1,000 per month. If you spend less than $1,000 per month, you earn 0% APY with the basic account. Aspiration Plus offers an impressive 3.00% APY on balances up to $10,000 (which goes down to 0% APY for balance portions above $10,000), but it comes with a few caveats. There is a $7.99 monthly fee that cannot be waived, although paying the fee annually rather than monthly reduces your cost to $5.99 per month. Signing up for the Plus account only guarantees you a 0.25% APY on balances up to $10,000 unless you also spend at least $1,000 per month, which qualifies you for the 3.00% APY. On balance amounts above $10,000, you earn 0.25% APY. Additional perks include cash back on purchases from “Conscience Coalition” members—retail companies that align with Aspiration’s commitment to social consciousness and sustainability. You can expect 3% to 5% cash back, with a basic account or 10% cash back, with the Plus account. Plus account holders will also receive carbon offsets for all gas purchases and one out-of-network ATM fee reimbursement per month. Notably, the Aspiration cash management accounts provide the highest FDIC insurance coverage on this list: up to $2 million. Read our Aspiration Cash Management Account Review. Aspiration’s mobile app allows you to track your spending according to the sustainability of the retailers you visit.

                                The annual percentage yield ("APY") on the deposit balances in Betterment Cash Reserve ("Cash Reserve") is 5.00% and represents the weighted average of the APY on deposit balances at the banks participating in Cash Reserve (the "Program Banks") and is current as of May 20, 2024. This APY is variable and subject to change daily. Deposit balances are not allocated equally among the participating Program Banks. A minimum deposit of $10 is required, but there is no minimum balance required to be maintained. The APY available to a customer may be lower if that customer designates a bank or banks as ineligible to receive deposits. APY applies only to Cash Reserve and does not apply to checking accounts held through Betterment Checking.

 N/A  The Betterment Cash Reserve account offers customers 5.00% variable APY on all balances—and no monthly maintenance fees. While you do need to deposit at least $10 to open a Cash Reserve account, there is no other minimum balance requirement and you can let your account go below $10 with no penalties. The Cash Reserve account is set up like a high-yield savings account. If you want to get the benefits of a checking account, you will need to open a Betterment Checking Account to accompany your Reserve account. Betterment’s Cash Reserve account allows you to set specific savings goals within your account, separating your money into targeted buckets. Account holders can set up automatic deposits for each of their goals. That said, the only way to deposit money into your Reserve account is either via electronic transfer from a separate funding account or via wire transfer (Betterment does not charge for wire transfers, but the originating bank may do so.) There is no option for mobile check deposit. Additionally, deposits and withdrawals will take one to two business days, depending on when you request them. Unlike other cash management accounts or traditional checking accounts, you cannot get immediate access to the money in your Betterment Cash Reserve account. However, there are no limits on withdrawals, as there often are with high-yield savings accounts. Since this account has fewer options than other CMAs that incorporate checking account services automatically, this will be a good fit for customers who need a savings and investing vehicle that is less convenient to access. This could be an excellent choice for someone who is trying to be more disciplined about their spending. Read our Betterment Cash Management Account Review and our investing team’s Betterment Review. Betterment’s recently redesigned mobile app has an easy-to-use interface and offers the ability to set investment or savings goals and quickly withdraw and deposit money with the click of a button, although the app is not necessarily maximized for checking account services.

 19,000+  The Wealthfront Cash Account is a CMA that can help you reach your savings and investing goals. The platform allows you to set a maximum balance that you want to keep in your account. When the platform detects that you have at least $100 more than your maximum, it will automatically transfer the money into one of your targeted accounts. You can set either monthly targets, such as $500 per month, or balance targets, such as $20,000. Once you have reached one target, Wealthfront will automatically start on the next target in your list. The Cash Account comes with a Visa-branded debit card, as well as fee-free access to 19,000+ ATMs. You’ll also get mobile check deposit, up to two days’ early access to paychecks you direct deposit and the ability to connect to Apple Pay, Google Pay and peer-to-peer payment apps. Though you can pay bills with your Cash Account, Wealthfront does not offer a bill pay service, like you may find with other CMAs. Wealthfront directs account holders to set up bill payment by using their Cash Account routing information on their creditors’ websites. Otherwise, you can use your debit card, or you can have Wealthfront cut a check. However, the “send a check” option is only available for customers who have held an average balance of at least $2,500 over the past 60 days and who have direct-deposited at least $250. While Wealthfront charges no monthly fee, you can expect some service fees. These include a $2.50 out-of-network ATM fee (on top of the ATM owner’s fee), a $2.50 bank teller fee (on top of the home bank’s teller fee), a 2.75% international transaction fee and a fee of up to $5.95 to make cash deposits at participating retailers.

Wealthfront’s mobile app allows you to track and organize your Cash Account financial transactions from its intuitive dashboard. 
 To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed 10 cash management accounts offered by robo-advisors, online investment firms and mobile trading apps. We ranked each account on 15 data points within the categories of fees, minimum requirements, APY, customer experience, digital experience and availability. The following is the weighting assigned to each category: Specific characteristics taken into consideration within each category included monthly fee, overdraft fee, ATM fees, minimum deposit requirements, minimum balance requirements, APY and the ease of earning it, ATM network size, check-writing capability, mobile and online access, customer experience ratings (App Store and Google Play) and FDIC insurance limits. Cash management accounts offering no or very low fees scored higher, as did those offering better-than-average interest, low minimum requirements and high customer service and digital experience scores.

A cash management account (CMA) acts as a combined savings and checking account that earns interest and has options for investing. Cash management accounts are managed by brokerages, robo-advisors or other nonbank financial institutions. They make it possible to manage cash—checking and savings accounts—and investments within one institution. Cash management accounts offer higher FDIC insurance coverage than regular checking and savings accounts by keeping money in one or more partner banks. This makes cash management accounts ideal for holding large cash balances. Features of cash management accounts differ from institution to institution but are often similar to those of traditional checking and savings accounts. Common features include check writing, a debit card, ATM withdrawals, direct deposit and more. CMAs usually have few fees, but there might be fees associated with a connected investment account. A cash management account works like a combined checking and savings account, except that it’s geared toward investors by offering interest, linked brokerage accounts and higher insurance amounts. Cash management accounts can often insure large amounts of money—well beyond the typical $250,000 limit on FDIC insurance—by partnering with multiple banks and spreading your deposits across them. These accounts offer plenty of flexibility in how you spend, save and invest cash within them. Although cash management accounts often offer APYs in line with high-yield savings accounts, you can typically access your money the same way you would with a checking account. You can often write checks, use a debit card and make electronic transfers with your CMA. CMAs also allow you to transfer money between checking, savings and investments—all under one roof. Because your CMA is held by a brokerage, you can easily jump on investment opportunities and funnel money into linked investment accounts as needed. Cash management accounts differ in the features they offer and how you use them. They can stand in for savings and checking accounts, and you use them in similar ways. Most CMAs come with a debit card or checks and support fee-free ATM use, direct deposit and ACH transactions. One difference between CMAs and regular bank accounts is a CMA’s ability to earn higher interest on cash. Some CMAs make it easy to transfer money between cash and investment accounts. They may have features that link these accounts. For example, some accounts allow round-up investing, which rounds up your purchases and invests the difference. Some include a portfolio line of credit, which lets you borrow against your investments. To use a CMA, you need to open an account with a brokerage, robo-advisor or another financial institution that offers these accounts. Some institutions require you to have an existing investment account before opening a CMA. While cash management accounts have benefits that appeal to those interested in combining checking and savings, they also have some drawbacks to consider. The best cash management accounts should offer several features, including a debit card, free ATM access and unlimited check writing. To find the right cash management account for your needs, shop around to compare your options. The following factors should be part of your decision process: Read more: What Is A Cash Management Account? Depending on your banking and investment needs, there are plenty of alternatives to cash management accounts. High-yield savings accounts, checking accounts, brokerage accounts and money market accounts all share certain features with cash management accounts. Both checking accounts and cash management accounts can handle your daily money management. They include features like a debit card, check-writing privileges and the ability to pay bills and receive direct deposits. However, checking accounts typically end there. They may earn modest interest rates, but they’re not meant for much more than everyday spending. On the other hand, CMAs serve other purposes. For example, CMAs tend to earn high interest, provide seamless access to your investment accounts and offer FDIC insurance beyond the normal limits. However, they may come with higher minimum deposit requirements and require you to open a brokerage account. Cash management accounts and savings accounts both earn interest. But CMAs also have features typical of a checking account—like check-writing abilities and a debit card. Plus, savings accounts often have transaction limits, while CMAs may allow for more flexibility. Because CMAs are held by brokerages and robo-advisors rather than banks, it’s easy to move money between your CMA and investments. CMAs can also provide a higher FDIC insurance limit than a typical savings account, so they may be a better place for balances over $250,000. However, high-yield savings accounts tend to offer higher rates, so if you’re not planning on investing or tapping into your savings regularly, they might be a better option.   Manage your money  Free retirement planning, budgeting, and suite of wealth management tools.

 Individuals who want both safety and accessibility for a large amount of money will be best served by a cash management account. Utilizing networks of partner banks, these accounts can offer FDIC insurance above the usual limits. Additionally, investors who would like to avoid having multiple accounts may find a cash management account will work for them. A joint cash management account allows two people access to a single cash management account. This makes it easy for couples to manage their money—including savings and checking accounts—together. CMAs may offer a number of services that are similar to those offered by a checking account. However, the main difference is that cash management accounts are a form of brokerage account offered by robo-advisors or online investment platforms. Yes, even though cash management accounts are offered by nonbank institutions, which FDIC insurance does not cover. However, institutions offering CMAs partner with FDIC-insured banks, which is where the account money will be swept every evening. This means cash management account holders can get more than the $250,000 FDIC insurance maximum per depositor for each ownership category—up to $2.5 million, depending on the platform. Yes, cash management accounts are typically FDIC-insured. The robo-advisor or online brokerage holding your CMA doesn’t directly provide FDIC coverage. Instead, your money is “swept” into FDIC-insured partner banks. One of the benefits of a CMA is that it can typically offer higher FDIC coverage limits than regular savings accounts.
