YG Entertainment has responded to confusion surrounding WINNER’s Song Mino’s attendance at his sister’s wedding. On May 28, Song Mino’s younger sister Song Dana held her wedding in San Francisco, California. Despite having enlisted in the military back in March, Song Mino was present at the wedding where he walked his younger sister down the aisle in place of their late father, who passed away last year. To clarify, Song Mino’s agency YG Entertainment shared with News1, “It’s true that Song Mino flew out after going through formal procedures to attend the wedding of his younger sister Song Dana.” Song Dana debuted with the girl group New.F.O in 2011 and made an appearance in Epik High’s “Born Hater” music video in 2014 alongside her brother. Last December, she appeared on Coupang Play’s dating program “Workplace Romance.” Source (1) (2)
