The student is being held at a juvenile detention center until further judicial proceedings. No one was injured during the incident. Seneca County Sheriff Fredrick Stevens said the incident is believed to be isolated. It’s our mental conditioning that makes it difficult for people to believe that children can indulge in violence," Stevens said in a press release Thursday. "However, it’s incidences like this one that remind us that all threats should be addressed." The sheriff's office said school officials were able to locate and secure the student until deputies arrived after learning of the threats.
