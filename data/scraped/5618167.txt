(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey)AP COLUMBUS, Ohio – A dark money nonprofit linked to the natural gas industry pushed for legislation redefining methane-based fuel as “green energy” months before it was introduced and passed in a 36-hour legislative sprint, records show. Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation earlier this month that will make it easier to drill for oil and gas in state parks. That bill also legally redefines natural gas as “green energy.” Natural gas is a fossil fuel and significant source of climate change. The term “green energy” typically refers to electricity derived from renewable sources like the sun or the wind.
