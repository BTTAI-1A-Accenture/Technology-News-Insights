No products in the basket. Manufacturer Ball Beverage Packaging EMEA,has now reduced its inbound supply chain carbon emissions by 82%. This reduction comes after a partnership with the Woodland Group. The reductions in their carbon levels took place between March 2021 and September 2022. Part of the reductions involved the Woodland Group, initiating a new rail route for Ball at its Doncaster facility, resulting in 4.35 times fewer emissions over 1,442 FEU's This equates to a reduction in 886 tonnes of carbon compared to if the containers had travelled by road. Alongside the reductions, the initiative meant that the freight trucking system ran more efficiently which helped to lower the number of demurrage penalties. The partnership was made in February 2021, with the aim of being carbon conscious and finding solutions to help bring down emissions Woodland Group also reduced the cost and energy consumption by 70% by installing motion sensing and lux-level detection LED lighting at the Doncaster site. Jack Harrison, Logistics Development Manager for Ball Beverage Packaging EMEA commented: “We are actively finding ways to reduce our carbon footprint by moving to intermodal solutions and alternative fuels across EMEA. “This is a great step forward to ensure our supply chain offers a competitive advantage to our customer base by offering a smarter and greener supply chain. This is credit to our partnership with Woodland Group and we look forward to future initiatives that can deliver even greater value.” Luke Fermor, Head of Fulfilment for Woodland Group, added: “Having the opportunity to work closely with Ball Beverage Packaging on driving carbon conscious initiatives through the supply chain has been a vital component to our partnership. Achieving 82% reduction on emissions on inland freight so far as a result is credit to our collective teams' commitment, innovative thinking, and collaborative approach, and we're excited to build on this further. “Working with clients like Ball is a real pleasure and seeing shared vision and sustainability objectives create tangible change is incredibly encouraging for us and our industry's future. Together we are already looking at new objectives for future development of carbon-conscious solutions that create opportunity and deliver sustainable supply chains.”   Who cares about carbon emissions we eant reliable non striking railways.
