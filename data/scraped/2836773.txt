No one was hurt in the December 10 incident, according to a spokesperson at Whiteman Air Force Base, which is the only operational base for the heavy bomber fleet. "A U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit experienced an in-flight malfunction during routine operations December 10 and was damaged on the runway at Whiteman Air Force Base after it successfully completed an emergency landing," MSgt. Beth Del Vecchio, spokesperson for USAF 509th Bomb Wing told FLYING. "There was a fire associated with the aircraft after landing, and the base fire department extinguished the fire. The incident is under investigation," Del Vecchio said. The Air Force introduced the B-2 in 1997 and has 20 bombers in active service and one test aircraft. Each aircraft is estimated to cost $1.2 billion.
