 Nuclear fusion is a process that releases energy by fusing atomic nuclei to form heavier nuclei. The history of nuclear fusion dates back to the 1920s when the concept was first introduced. Since then, many scientists and researchers have been working on developing nuclear fusion technology for energy production. In recent times, there has been a renewed interest in nuclear fusion, with many countries investing in large-scale projects to develop commercial fusion reactors. This thesis discusses the history of nuclear fusion, current projects in development, and its future. It also lists the advantages of nuclear fusion and the parties involved in its development, as well as the current progress and development costs. Introduction The demand for energy has been increasing at an exponential rate, and fossil fuels have been the primary source of energy production. However, the continued use of fossil fuels has led to a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions, contributing to global warming and climate change. This has led to the development of alternative sources of energy, including nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is a process that releases energy by fusing atomic nuclei to form heavier nuclei. It is a clean and sustainable source of energy that has the potential to meet the world's energy demand. History of Nuclear Fusion The concept of nuclear fusion was first introduced in the 1920s by Arthur Eddington, who proposed that stars derive their energy from nuclear fusion reactions. However, it was not until the 1930s that scientists were able to demonstrate nuclear fusion in the laboratory. In 1932, the first successful fusion experiment was conducted by Mark Oliphant, who bombarded deuterium nuclei with accelerated protons to produce helium nuclei. In the 1950s, the first experimental fusion reactors were built, including the stellarator and the tokamak. The tokamak, which was developed by Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm in the Soviet Union, became the most successful experimental reactor. It uses a magnetic field to confine plasma, a hot ionized gas, in a toroidal shape. In 1968, the Joint European Torus (JET) was built, which is still the largest operational tokamak in the world. Current Tech Despite these challenges, however, fusion research continues to advance at an astonishing pace. In recent years, a number of new approaches to fusion have emerged, each with its own unique advantages and challenges. These include: These new approaches to fusion hold the promise of dramatically reducing the cost and complexity of fusion power, and could potentially make it a practical source of energy within our lifetimes. Current Projects in Development There are currently several large-scale projects in development to develop commercial nuclear fusion reactors.  Advantages of Nuclear Fusion Nuclear fusion has several advantages over other sources of energy.  Whats the costs? The cost structure of a fusion nuclear plant development can vary depending on several factors such as the technology used, the size and complexity of the plant, the location, and the regulatory requirements. However, here is a general breakdown of the different costs involved in the development of a fusion nuclear plant: It is worth noting that the cost of developing a fusion nuclear plant is highly uncertain and depends on several factors. Nevertheless, these are the primary cost categories that need to be considered in the development of a fusion nuclear plant. In summary, we are heading towards some exciting times with the development.
