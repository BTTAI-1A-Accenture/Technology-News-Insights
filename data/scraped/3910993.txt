 		In this technologically advanced world, individuals have to stay current with the trends and developments so that they are able to function effectively and competitively. The same applies for classroom teachers. No longer are teachers expected to use chalk and talk methods to engage the twenty first century learner. In keeping with modern practices and advances, the teacher has to evolve in order to best meet the needs of the learners and to perform at the highest possible standard.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an emerging trend that carries with it quite a bit of trepidation. While one can see the advantages of understanding and using AI, one can also understand that there comes with it the ostensibly quite important opposing disadvantages. There may be those who fear or abhor change, but it is best to embrace these changes and use them to advance pedagogical practices. AI has recently taken the world by storm, where simple to complex tasks have been computerised. This allows form efficiency and precision. The classroom is not exempt and it is in this light that this article seeks to explore and discuss the benefits of using AI tools to enhance the teaching-learning process and adequately prepare students for the future. The five tools that are deemed game changers in teaching and learning are: Edmentum, Gradescope, Copilot, ClassPoint and ChatGPT. Why Every Teacher Needs to Embrace AI in the Classroom             Have you ever wanted a way to engage students with the latest                 technology, while also teaching them new skills?
