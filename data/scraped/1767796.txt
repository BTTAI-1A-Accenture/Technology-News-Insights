FAQ - New Privacy Policy Director of PR and social media at the Better Business Bureau Melanie McGovern joined ‘Mornings with Maria’ to share how Taylor Swift fans can safely purchase tickets and avoid online scams.  A Massachusetts dad said this week that he was forced to spend $21,000 on four tickets to a Taylor Swift concert, after the ones he bought on StubHub last year for his daughter as a Christmas present never arrived, according to a report.  Anthony Silva told WCVB-TV he originally spent around $1,800 for the four tickets last November on StubHub, a ticket reseller site, but the ducats were never delivered, and the company told him replacement seats weren’t available.  "That’s just not right," Silva told the station, adding that he decided to shell out $21,000 on another reseller site for the "Look What You Made Me Do" singer’s Saturday show that his daughter and her friends had their hearts set on at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.  He said while StubHub plans to refund his original purchase, he doesn’t think resellers should wait "until the day before for the tickets to be sent out."  TAYLOR SWIFT TICKETMASTER CRISIS SPARKS SENATE JUDICIARY HEARING, LIVE NATION AND SEATGEEK CALLED AS WITNESSES Taylor Swift performing at Gillette Stadium on Friday.  (Scott Eisen/TAS23/Getty Images for TAS Rights Management / Getty Images) Fox News Digital has reached out to StubHub for comment.  The dad, who even got a limousine for the special occasion, added that he played a joke on his daughter and friends this week after he secured tickets, telling them he couldn't get new ones, "and the look on their faces I never want to see again. It was tough, it was tough. One girl, I won't tell you who, had a quivering lip."  His daughter Katlyn Silva, 19, told the station she was "so angry" and "disappointed" about the ticket mishap "'cause I was looking forward to this for nine months."  She said when she found out they had seats she started jumping on her parents, thanking them.  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER A botched pre-sale on Ticketmaster last year highlighted both Swift's popularity and the problems with ticket selling sites.  ((Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) / Getty Images) Friend Alyssa Camara said she was "getting ready to cry" until she found out Silva had gotten them "better tickets."
