Earlier, farmers owing allegiance to various farm bodies, including Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakunda), BKU (Rajewal), BKU (Kadian), BKU Ekta (Ugrahan) and BKU (Sidhupur), started reaching Mansurwal to express anguish over the police action in which several protesters were arrested for blocking the national highway and also obstructing security personnel from performing their duties.
The situation turned tense on Tuesday when the farmers removed police barricades to head towards the protest site and also damaged some of their vehicles which were parked in the middle of the road, officials said.
Police had provided an alternative route to the protest site but members of farmer unions were adamant about taking the other route starting from the T-point at National Highway 54.


Some protesters even rammed their jeep into on-duty police personnel while trying to remove barricades. A few people hit some police personnel with sticks as they tried to stop farmers from going towards the protest site, a police official said.
Eight police personnel received minor injuries in the incident. They were taken to a civil hospital in Zira, the official said.
In Chandigarh, the high court asked the protesters to end their stir.

Bali also said the Punjab government, through its counsel, submitted an affidavit, giving details of the FIR registered against protesters and details of their land in case the court wants to attach their properties.
The next date of the hearing in the matter is fixed for December 23.
On Tuesday evening, several farmer leaders, including Nirbhay Singh Dhudi, Harinder Singh Lakhowal and Gurmeet Singh Mehma, held a meeting with Inspector General of Police Jaskaran Singh, Deputy Commissioner Amrit Singh and Senior Superintendent of Police Kanwardeep Kaur.

The leaders said they have formed a five-member committee to decide the future course of action in consultation with the Sanjha Morcha Zira.
