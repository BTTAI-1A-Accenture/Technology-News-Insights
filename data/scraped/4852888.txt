DUBLIN, Dec. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The "Quantum Computing Applications in the Financial Services Industry: End-User Cases and Market Forecasts" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report describes the opportunities, challenges and deployment options surrounding the application of quantum computing in the financial services vertical. It discusses in detail the role that quantum computing plays in portfolio management and construction, currency arbitrage, fraud detection, trade settlements, analytics-driven CRM, credit scoring, risk modeling, tax-loss harvesting and derivative pricing. The report also takes a look at quantum computing's role in accelerating the use of AI and machine learning in the financial services sector. The report provides a ten-year forecast of what the banking and financial services sector will spend on quantum computing in the next decade, and it discusses the evolution of quantum computing in the financial services sector from the current "proof of concept phase" to widespread usage in a decade or so. The report looks at smaller and less-expensive quantum computers that could, for example, be used in smaller financial institutions and in the role of network computers in transaction networks. In late 2019, Bank of America claimed quantum computing "would be as revolutionary in the 2020s as smartphones were in the 2010s." Goldman Sachs was quoted in January 2020 saying quantum computing has the potential to become a critical technology in the financial services sector. Other big banks have made commitments to quantum computing including JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo as well as some European and Asian banks. Insurance companies, credit card companies, financial consultants and hedge funds are also interested. Many financial service firms are already taking on sizeable staffing of people experienced in the overlap of quantum technology and financial industry activity. This report concludes with a review of the current plans of what the leading full-stack quantum computers are doing in the financial services space. It also provides a focus on sales strategy to sell banks and other financial institutions on using quantum computing Key Topics Covered: Chapter One: Background to this Report1.1 Executive Summary - Quantum Computing in Financial Services1.2 Putting Business Ahead of Research1.3 The Math is Out There, the Hardware is Not1.4 Methodology of this Report1.4.1 Forecasting MethodologyChapter Two: Quantum Computing in Financial Services: Attitudes and Market Evolution2.1 Attitudes to Quantum in the Financial Services Industry2.2 Changing Market and Deployment Patterns of Quantum Computing for Financial Services2.2.1 A Note on Regulation and Quantum Computing Deployment2.3 IT Aspects to Quantum Computing Deployment in Financial Services2.3.1 Hardware Aspects2.3.2 Software Aspects2.3.3 Impact on Coding of a Probabilistic Approach2.3.4 Challenges to Cloud Provisioning2.3.5 Batch-like Nature of Quantum2.4 Key Points from this ChapterChapter Three: Quantum Computing in Financial Services - Use Cases3.1 Using Quantum Computing within Financial Services3.1.1 Quantum Machine Learning3.2 Trade Settlements3.2.1 High Frequency Trading (HFT)3.3 Risk Modeling3.4 Accelerating Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)3.5 Goals-based Investment (Static) Portfolio Construction3.6 Tax Loss Harvesting3.7 Fraud Detection3.8 Analytics-Driven CRM3.9 Dynamic Portfolio Management3.10 Credit Scoring3.11 Currency Arbitrage3.12 Derivative Pricing3.13 Key Points from this ChapterChapter Four: Vendors and Other Considerations4.1 Vendor Considerations: The Quantum Computing Industry4.1.1 Full-Stack Quantum Computers4.1.2 Access to Quantum Computing Resources4.2 Sales Strategies for Quantum Computers in Banking and Financial Services4.3 Cybersecurity in the Financial Services Data Center4.4 Expenditures on Quantum Computers Companies Mentioned For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/2y522s Media Contact: Research and MarketsLaura Wood, Senior Managerpress@researchandmarkets.com For E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 U.S. Fax: 646-607-1907Fax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716 Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/539438/Research_and_Markets_Logo.jpg  View original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/financial-services-industry-quantum-computing-applications-market-analysis-report-2022-2032-featuring-citigroup-jpmorgan--wells-fargo-301709018.html SOURCE  Research and Markets © 2024 Benzinga.com.
