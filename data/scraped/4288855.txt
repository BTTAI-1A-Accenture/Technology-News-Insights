BTCX Token, a revolutionary platform inspired by the rebranding of Twitter and the visionary influence of Elon Musk, has secured $1.5 million in pre-seed and seed funding to address inefficiencies in the cryptocurrency market. With the aim of upgrading Bitcoin by introducing hyper-deflationary features, BTCX Token seeks to redefine the future of cryptocurrency, tackling key challenges such as volatility, inefficiency, scalability, and sustainability.   The recently concluded funding, with a valuation of $10 million, is backed by prominent names in the industry by following the steps of the early-staged Bitcoin, enabling BTCX Token to fully enhance its technological foundation and expand both within and outside the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

BTCX Token’s unique approach in the form of the combustion model represents a systematic means of controlling supply.

This simplification and democratization of staking marks a significant milestone, setting it apart from more traditional and volatile avenues. By rewarding stakers, BTCX Token aligns user interests with network growth, creating a mutually beneficial environment. This alignment of incentives fosters community participation and engagement, a crucial factor for enduring success in the rapidly changing crypto world. The Tokenomics of BTCX Token are intricately woven into the fabric of its design, ensuring long-term viability and a deep commitment to growth. With a total supply of 21,000,000 BTCX Token, the structure includes 5,250,000 BTCX Token for presale, 8,610,000 BTCX Token for burning, 5,040,000 BTCX Token as a reward for staking, and 2,100,000 BTCX Token for liquidity. The presale of BTCX Token Token allowed investors to buy at attractive prices, reflecting the community’s confidence in this groundbreaking project.
