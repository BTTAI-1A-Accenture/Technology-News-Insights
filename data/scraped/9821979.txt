Joe Choong, Myles Pillage and Charles Brown finished first as Team GB earned a total of nine medals on day 11 in Poland. Choong, 28, added an individual silver medal to his Olympic and world titles. The performance secured a Paris 2024 Olympic quota place as did his partner Olivia Green's earlier bronze in the women's event. Choong finished second to Italian Giorgio Malan, who was 7.7 seconds ahead of him in the final laser run in a time of nine minutes, 58 secs. "For my last two [Olympic] Games, I managed to get that qualification spot the year before, which means you don't have to travel the world the year of the Games, doing every competition trying to chase the qualification points," said Choong. "It means you can really focus on which competitions you want and really get in a good block of training without the distraction and pressure of trying to get those points at the last minute."
