This is valuable coverage in cases where local construction costs have spiked and made your dwelling coverage insufficient.

It is harder to find, but some of the best home insurance companies offer it. See MoreSee Less Some insurers have official lists of banned dog breeds.

Here are the main coverage types to consider.         
 It’s smart to compare home insurance quotes from multiple insurance companies. Insurers’ rates can vary considerably for the same coverage, so it’s good to compare quotes from at least three companies. Insurance companies offer many home insurance discounts that can reduce your policy costs. Here are common ones. What’s the best home insurance isn’t the same for everyone. Here’s how to find the best home insurance for you. EXPERT TIPS George Hosfield Advisory Board Member Les Masterson Insurance Editor Ashlee Valentine Insurance Editor Amy Danise Insurance Managing Editor Michelle Megna Insurance Lead Editor Roof claims are one of the most common (and expensive) claim types and the terms of roof coverage can vary significantly. Some policies provide coverage for the full replacement cost of the roof. Others only provide the current “actual cash value” which may be a fraction of the total cost. Some policies have separate, higher deductibles for roof claims. When comparing policies, be sure to understand these nuances.   Advisory Board Member Your home insurance company or agent should be able to provide an estimate of how much it would cost to rebuild your house. This should be your dwelling coverage amount. One common mistake I’ve seen is that people confuse this amount with the real estate market value, but it’s not the same. And don’t include land value.  Insurance Editor Our research finds that home insurance discounts can save you hundreds on your policy. One of the best discounts is bundling home and auto policies. We found that State Farm beats competitors with an average 23% multi-policy discount. Make sure to ask about how much you can save by bundling.  Insurance Editor We suggest owners of high-value homes focus on insurers that specialize in high-value homes such as Chubb. They can provide high levels of liability coverage and have special coverage options that address the needs of these homeowners.  Insurance Managing Editor When shopping for home insurance, I recommend making sure you get quotes for the same coverage from at least three insurers. That will allow you to accurately compare each company.  Insurance Lead Editor Nearly all of our top picks for the best home insurance companies have complaint levels that are below the industry average.  Ask an expert Ashlee Valentine Insurance Editor Michelle Megna Insurance Lead Editor Les Masterson Insurance Editor Jason Metz Insurance Lead Editor Penny Gusner Insurance Senior Writer Kathryn P., Danbury, Connecticut A home’s replacement cost is not the same as its real estate value. Replacement cost is the amount you would need to rebuild your home using current building costs. Real estate value is a property’s value if you were to sell it and includes land value. A home’s replacement cost is typically less than its real estate value. I suggest focusing on replacement cost when buying home insurance so you don’t buy more coverage than you need. Insurance Editor -Michael I., Brentwood, Tennessee No, standard homeowners insurance doesn’t cover flood damage. You instead typically need to buy a separate flood insurance policy either through the National Flood Insurance Program or a private insurer that sells flood coverage. NFIP policies are capped at $250,000 dwelling coverage but I’ve found that you may be able to find higher levels with a private insurance company.  Insurance Lead Editor -Ron T., St. Louis, Missouri Filing a home insurance claim can increase your rates at the next renewal time, so you want to make sure you won’t pay more to fix your home or replace your items in the long run. For instance, if you have a $1,000 deductible and you’re reporting a loss of, say, less than $1,500, it likely wouldn’t be wise to file a claim, since you’ll likely pay more over time because of the possible rate increase. Insurance Editor -Don D., Phoenix, Arizona When choosing a liability insurance amount, think about your assets and savings, which could be at risk if you’re sued. A policy’s liability coverage generally only goes up to $500,000. If you need more coverage, you can buy umbrella insurance, which will offer liability coverage of $1 million and up. Insurance Lead Editor -Joseph M., Martinsville, Virginia An insurance company’s offerings, financial stability and customer satisfaction may all be factors when choosing an insurer. For instance, extended replacement and guaranteed replacement coverage are options not offered by all insurers. These coverage upgrades provide higher dwelling coverage if your home is damaged or destroyed and inflation and/or higher building costs exceed your policy’s coverage limit. If that extra coverage is important to you, narrow your options to companies that offer that coverage.

				Looking for Homeowners Insurance?
			 Based on our analysis, the cheapest home insurance companies are Progressive, Nationwide, Erie, USAA and State Farm.   Those are good starting points, but the cheapest home insurance for you will vary depending on your location and the type of house you’re insuring. Shop around for a few home insurance quotes. And if you’re also getting car insurance quotes, ask about a discount for bundling auto and home insurance with the same company. Homeowners insurance covers your house, other structures on your property like a detached garage, personal property like furniture and clothing, liability insurance, additional living expenses and medical payments coverage.   HO-3 is the most common type of homeowners insurance policy and it covers your house for any problems except those specifically excluded in the policy. It additionally covers personal property for specific problems named in the policy, such as fire, theft and smoke damage. Contact the home insurance company or your insurance agent to file a home insurance claim over the phone, through the company’s website, chat, email or app, depending on the company. You want to document the loss by providing information about the cause, when it happened and a list of what was lost.   If your home was damaged, you should try to prevent more damage, such as boarding up a broken window. We wouldn’t suggest fixing the problem before contacting your insurance company. The insurer may want to send an adjuster to observe the damage. You should also keep damaged items so the insurer can document. Once the insurance company is done with its investigation, the insurer will offer a claims payout.
