(NYSE: VST) (the "Company" or "Vistra") announced today the launch of senior secured notes due 2033 (the "Secured Notes") and senior unsecured notes due 2031 (the "Unsecured Notes" and, together with the Secured Notes, the "Notes") in concurrent private offerings (the "Offerings") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and to certain non-U.S. persons in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Secured Notes will be senior, secured obligations of Vistra Operations Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Issuer"), and the Unsecured Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Issuer. The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Issuer's current and future subsidiaries that also guarantee the Issuer's Credit Agreement, dated as of October 3, 2016 (as amended, the "Credit Agreement"), by and among the Issuer, as borrower, Vistra Intermediate Company LLC, the guarantors party thereto, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch (as successor to Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch), as administrative and collateral agent, various lenders and letter of credit issuers party thereto, and the other parties named therein. The Secured Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under the Issuer's Credit Agreement and certain other agreements, which consists of a substantial portion of the property, assets and rights owned by the Issuer and the subsidiary guarantors as well as the stock of the Issuer. The collateral securing the Secured Notes will be released if the Issuer's senior, unsecured long-term debt securities obtain an investment grade rating from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if such rating agencies withdraw the investment grade rating of the Issuer's senior, unsecured long-term debt securities or downgrade such rating below investment grade.  The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Offerings (i) to fund the cash component of the acquisition of Energy Harbor Corp. ("Energy Harbor") pursuant to that certain transaction agreement, dated as of March 6, 2023, by and among the Issuer, Black Pen Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer ("Merger Sub"), and Energy Harbor, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Energy Harbor, with Energy Harbor surviving as an indirect subsidiary of Vistra (the "Merger"), (ii) for general corporate purposes, including to refinance outstanding indebtedness, and (iii) to pay fees and expenses related to the Offerings. If the Merger is not consummated, the Company intends to use the proceeds from the Offerings (i) for general corporate purposes, including to refinance outstanding indebtedness, and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the Offerings. The Offerings are not conditioned upon the completion of the Merger. In addition, the consummation of the Secured Offering is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Unsecured Offering, and the consummation of the Unsecured Offering is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Secured Offering. The Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state or other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.
