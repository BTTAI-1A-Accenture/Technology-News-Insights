PPL says it has fixed technology-related and website problems that led to frustrated and angry customers during January, including some who received “estimated” bills that seem far higher than they normally pay. The main problem resulted from a “technical system issue” that prevented the Allentown-based utility from accessing customer usage data. It caused PPL to send estimated bills to some customers, with the estimates based on customers’ past usage. The practice is allowed by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, which regulates utilities and looks into complaints from customers.
