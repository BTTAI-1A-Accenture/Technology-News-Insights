The Week 17 NFL schedule opens with Malik Willis and the Tennessee Titans hosting Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football. All-Pro running back Derrick Henry (hip) is doubtful and Josh Dobbs is expected to make his first start of the season in place of Ryan Tannehill and Malik Willis for Tennessee. Before locking in any Titans vs. Cowboys Showdown NFL DFS lineups for Thursday Night Football on sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, you NEED to see what SportsLine's Jimmie Kaylor has to say. Kaylor is a NFL and DFS expert for SportsLine, who opened the 2022 NFL season by winning DraftKings' NFL Showdown Thursday Kickoff Millionaire contest. He edged out over 355,000 other entrants in the contest and also has multiple five-figure tournament wins on his DFS resume. Kaylor, who has been cashing big all season, has covered the NFL and college football for close to a decade as a member of the Pro Football Writers of America, and his background as a former college and NFL player gives him a unique perspective when building his fantasy lineups and locking in his betting picks.   Kaylor has been spot-on all season, hitting on epic NFL DFS picks like Jerry Jeudy (4-102-1), Stefon Diggs (12-148-3, 6-106-1, 7-92-1), Amari Cooper (7-101-1, 5-131-1), Nick Chubb (23-113-1, 23-101-2), CeeDee Lamb (8-87-1), Deebo Samuel (6-115-1) Cooper Kupp (14-122), Travis Kelce (7-25-4, 10-106), Davante Adams (3-124-2), Justin Fields (179-1-1, 82-1), Derrick Henry (132-2), Jimmy Garoppolo (228-4), Michael Pittman (7-61-1), Christian McCaffrey (26-108-1, 6-30), Kirk Cousins (460-4), Justin Jefferson (12-123-1), J.K. Dobbins (13-125), Aaron Jones (17-90, 4-36-1), and T.J. Hockenson (13-109-2). Anyone who has followed his picks is WAY UP! Now, Kaylor has turned his attention to Cowboys vs. Titans on Week 17 Thursday Night Football and locked in his top daily Fantasy football picks. We can tell you that one of Kaylor's top NFL DFS picks for the Titans vs. Cowboys TNF matchup is Dallas wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. "On paper this matchup looks outstanding for CeeDee Lamb and the Dallas passing attack. Tennessee has one of the best rushing defenses in the NFL, but has been highly susceptible against the pass. Lamb has been on a tear, hauling in 17 passes for 246 yards and two touchdowns in his last two games. My biggest concern is that Dallas will jump out to a big early lead with Tennessee being decimated by injuries. Still, I expect Lamb to be active early and notch his third consecutive 100-yard receiving performance." Kaylor is also targeting another under-the-radar option for TNF who could post HUGE numbers and carry your lineups to victory on Thursday Night Football. This pick could be the difference between winning your tournaments and cash games or going home with nothing! You ABSOLUTELY need to see who it is before locking in any lineups.  Be sure to follow Jimmie (@jimmiekaylor) on Twitter for notifications about rosters changes/updates.   What are the top NFL DFS picks for Titans vs. Cowboys on FanDuel and DraftKings?
