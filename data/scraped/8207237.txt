Southwest Airlines service has resumed after flights at airports across the country were temporarily paused due to an "intermittent technology issue," the airline and the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday.  "Southwest has resumed operations after temporarily pausing flight activity this morning to work through data connection issues resulting from a firewall failure," a statement to NBC 5 from the airline read.  üì∫ 24/7 Chicago news stream: Watch NBC 5 free wherever you are "Early this morning, a vendor-supplied firewall went down and connection to some operational data was unexpectedly lost.

"As a result of the intermittent technology issues that we experienced, we should hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible," a tweet from Southwest Airlines read Tuesday. "We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we're hoping to get everyone going ASAP." Good morning, Abby. As a result of the intermittent technology issues that we experienced, we should hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we're hoping to get everyone going ASAP. -Jeni The tweet is one of several Southwest Airlines wrote as many travelers took to social media to indicate they were recently informed their flights had been delayed for various reasons pertaining to an "outage."
