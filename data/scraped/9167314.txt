 Whether to take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions is an important decision you'll make when preparing your federal income tax return. The standard deduction is a fixed dollar amount that reduces your taxable income.  Itemized deductions can also reduce your taxable income, but the amount varies and is not predetermined.  Just FYI: Most taxpayers take the standard deduction. But, to make your decision, you must know the standard deduction amount for each tax year and how additional standard deduction benefits exist for people over 65. And you will want to know about other special rules for the standard deduction. (More on all of that later.) Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. But remember that in most cases (there are some exceptions discussed below) the decision of whether to take the standard deduction or itemize is up to you.  However, if you're trying to decide whether to itemize or take the standard deduction, the IRS says, “You should itemize deductions if: (1) Your allowable itemized deductions are greater than your standard deduction, or (2) If you can’t use the standard deduction.”  So, you already know that most of the time, you can take the standard deduction if you don’t itemize deductions. But there are some exceptions to that general idea. For example, you cannot take the standard deduction if:  The IRS released the 2024 standard deduction amounts for returns normally filed in April 2025. These amounts are provided in the chart below. 2024 Standard Deduction Amounts: (Returns Normally Due April 2025) Note: If you are at least 65 or blind, you can claim an additional 2024 standard deduction of $1,950 (also $1,950 if using the single or head of household filing status). If you're both 65 and blind, the additional deduction amount is doubled. If you can be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, your 2024 standard deduction is limited to the greater of $1,300 or your earned income plus $450. (However, the total cannot exceed the basic standard deduction for your filing status). If you haven't filed your 2023 federal income tax return due to a deadline extension, those standard deduction amounts are as follows: 2023 Standard Deduction Amounts: (Returns Normally Due April 2024) Note: If you are at least 65 or blind, you can claim an additional 2023 standard deduction of $1,850 (also $1,850 if using the single or head of household filing status). If you're both 65 and blind, the additional deduction amount is doubled. Can you be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer? In that case, your 2023 standard deduction is limited to the greater of $1,250 or your earned income plus $400 (but the total cannot be more than the basic standard deduction for your filing status). The amount of your standard deduction depends on several different factors. For example: Note: The IRS adjusts the standard deduction annually for inflation. So, that's why your 2024 standard deduction is higher than it was for the 2023 tax year. (You can see how that works in the charts for 2023 compared to 2024 below). But, for example, let’s say you had $50,000 in income for 2024, and your filing status is single. The standard deduction is $14,600, which, applied to your earned income, would bring your taxable income to $35,400.  There are extra standard deduction amounts if you or your spouse is blind and if you are 65 or older.  For the additional standard deduction for people who are blind, you have to be completely blind by the end of a given tax year. Or, you have to have a doctor's certification (in this case, an ophthalmologist or optometrist) that your eyesight is not better than 20/200 (in the best eye with corrective lenses). Or, your doctor must certify that your field of vision is 20 degrees or less. If you are 65 or older or blind, you can claim an additional standard deduction.  For 2024, that extra standard deduction is $1,950 if you are single or file as head of household. If you're married filing jointly or separately, the extra standard deduction is $1,550 per qualifying individual. Remember: For filers 65 or older, the additional standard deduction is on top of the regular standard deduction for a given tax year. If you are 65 or older and blind, the extra standard deduction is $3,900 for 2024 if you are single or filing as head of household. It's $3,100 per qualifying individual if you are married filing jointly or separately.  Your standard deduction is limited when someone else claims you as a dependent on their tax return. For 2024, the limit is $1,300 or your earned income, plus $450, whichever is greater.  (For the 2023 tax year, the limit for dependents claimed on someone else’s tax return was $1,250 or the dependent’s earned income plus $400.  Note: Remember that with these calculations, the total standard deduction still cannot exceed the normal standard deduction for your filing status.  For example, If you own a home, you may be able to deduct your mortgage interest, points, and insurance, which could be more than the standard deduction.  Although some itemized deductions have changed since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), you may still have enough deductions for medical expenses, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes to make itemizing a good choice.  If you are uncertain whether itemizing deductions will save you money on your tax return or whether you can claim the standard deduction, consult a trusted, qualified tax advisor.  The standard deduction is adjusted annually for inflation. So, the standard deduction amount for the different filing statuses changes slightly each year. (You can see the difference in the following table between the standard deduction amount for 2024 compared to 2023.) 2023 vs. 2024 Standard Deduction However, the last time the standard deduction changed significantly was when the TCJA became effective.  The TCJA (which some people know as the “Trump tax cuts”) nearly doubled the standard deduction. The law also reduced the benefit of, eliminated, or restricted some popular deductions, including charitable contributions, state and local taxes, and mortgage interest. As a result, many people didn’t have enough itemized deductions to exceed the higher standard deduction. It's important to know that the TCJA provisions are set to expire in 2025, so the standard deduction may revert to pre-2017 levels.  Last year, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives proposed a bonus standard deduction. That would be an up to $ 4,000 addition to the standard deduction for joint filers ($2,000 for single filers and $3,000 for a head of household). However, that bonus deduction lacked bipartisan support and it's unclear right now, what will happen to the standard deduction amount after the election.
