Phoenix police detectives are investigating an incident involving an officer firing at a suspect accused of pulling out a firearm at a superstore. Just before 11 a.m. Saturday, a loss prevention employee at a Walmart Supercenter at 35th and Southern avenues noticed a man believed to be shoplifting. An off-duty Phoenix police officer who was in the area near the store was alerted of the shoplifting attempt, police said. The police officer, who was still in full uniform, went to assist the loss prevention employee when the man, later identified as 35-year-old David Apana, pulled out a gun and pointed it at both the officer and the loss prevention employee, police said. The officer then fired his gun in an attempt to shoot the man and missed him. After the shooting, Apana ran towards the center of the store and eventually made it outside, police said. Apana was seen by responding officers running into a nearby neighborhood. A perimeter was set around Apana’s last known location. Apana was located and arrested. A firearm was also located next to the area where Apana was found. It was confirmed he was not struck by the officer’s shot. There were no injuries to any other community members or officers, according to police. Apana was booked on multiple felonies, including aggravated assault on a police officer.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others.
