A$AP Rocky is anxiously awaiting Rihanna’s 2023 Super Bowl halftime show like the rest of her fans. The New York rapper told Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1 on Wednesday that he’s “super excited” about his partner’s Feb. 12 show. “Oh, man. I’m just as excited as you guys, if not more,” he said, according to Billboard. “Yeah, I’m super excited. This is huge. This is incredible. I’m so glad that my lady’s back making music again and whatnot, and getting back out there.” “It’s just incredible,” he continued. “Especially for both of us — it is a good year for both of us to be more active and be out there. But the Super Bowl is huge, and her being the creative she is, she going to bring it, man. I’m excited. I’m more excited than everybody else, honestly.” Rihanna, who dropped a teaser for the performance on Friday, sent social media into a frenzy in September when she not-so-subtly revealed that she was tapped to perform by posting a photo on Instagram of her hand holding a football. 🤫#SBLVII#AppleMusicHalftimepic.twitter.com/rfZgTrX103 — Rihanna (@rihanna) January 13, 2023 The beauty mogul told the Associated Press in November that preparing for her upcoming Super Bowl performance was “a challenge that I welcomed.” “It was a stage bigger than everything I’ve ever done,” she said. “It’s one of those things that if I’m going to leave my baby, I’m going to leave my baby for something special. And I was willing to do it. It was now or never for me, I feel like.” Rihanna and A$AP Rocky welcomed their first child, a baby boy, in May 2022. She shared pictures and a video of the infant on social media for the first time last month, but the couple has yet to share the baby’s name publicly.

Michael Penix Jr. is done for the preseason, Raheem Morris said. Mike Tyson had little interest in trash-talking or insulting Jake Paul during the press conference for their Nov. 15 fight on Netflix.

The stylish star went big on black and white for her collection of dishes, decor and more with housewares brand Hudson Grace. Russell Wilson got his first preseason start after being held out last week. In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020.
