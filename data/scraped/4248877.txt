Two big Oregon legal technology companies are combining, with Beaverton-based Exterro buying Portland’s Zapproved in a deal worth “hundreds of millions” of dollars. Little known outside the legal services industry, Exterro and Zapproved are nonetheless among Oregon’s largest technology businesses. The combined company plans to retain all 131 Zapproved employees, giving Exterro a staff of about 750 altogether. “We want to be one of these amazing stories for the Portland entrepreneurial world,” said Exterro CEO Bobby Balachandran.
