Phoenix Suns players Kevin Durant, Chris Paul and T.J. Warren watched some women’s basketball games while they were in Dallas before their own game against the Dallas Mavericks. The three stopped by Athletes Unlimited to watch women’s professional basketball players light up the court. The Suns beat the Mavericks and it could have been because the trio picked up some luck from Athletes Unlimited players. supporting women's sports.@CP3 x @KDTrey5 x @TonyWarrenJr pic.twitter.com/ql9cSLfvd7 — Athletes Unlimited (@AUProSports) March 5, 2023  Durant is an advisory board member of the league and, more recently, an investor. Athletes Unlimited raised $30 million in new funding at the end of 2022 and Durant was part of the diverse investor groups. “We have been advisors for AU since the very beginning, and we’re excited to be a part of this capital raise,” Durant said in an Athletes Unlimited press release. “Athletes Unlimited is at the forefront of women’s sports and an inspiration for how sports leagues can thrive with an athlete-first business model.” Durant consistently brings women’s professional basketball to the forefront across his social media. When Athletes Unlimited announced a renewed partnership with Nike, Durant shared the news with his 20.8 million followers on Twitter.

Shortly after Stewart signed with the Liberty, Durant was traded to the Suns. .@KDTrey5 REALLY wants Breanna Stewart to join the New York Liberty. 🗽👀 "I hit [Breanna Stewart] the other day, and I never do this, and was like, 'Yo, it would be an incredible dynasty in New York City if you came here.'" pic.twitter.com/BTnCtkETJW — Boardroom (@boardroom) January 30, 2023  When he got to Phoenix, a touching video was shared on the Phoenix Mercury’s social media account of Durant and WNBA superstar and Olympic champion Brittney Griner embracing.
