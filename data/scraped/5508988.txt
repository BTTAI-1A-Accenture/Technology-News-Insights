  power transformers market: market dynamics    power transformers market: challenge    the modernization of existing transformers is notably driving the power transformer market growth.  factors such as the rise in the installation of new transformers and the replacement of old transformers with new ones are generating growth.globally, the majority of the t&d infrastructure needs renovation, mainly due to the existing networks being unable to meet the growth in the demand for power.for instance, in russia, chelyabenergo, a subsidiary of the utility interregional distribution grid companies (idgc), completed its reconstruction work on the 110/10 kv miass substation in the urals in 2015. such factors are expected to drive the demand for power transformers. in many countries, smart grid networks are also being increasingly used. however, asmart grid refers to an electricity network that provides an economical, sustainable, and secure electricity supply by intelligently integrating the actions of all users, whether they are consumers, generators, or those capable of both in an efficient manner.the use of smart grid systems has allowed utilities to focus on the installation of more power transformers for the effective transmission of electric power. therefore, the need for transformer oil is also rising, with more transformers being installed into the grid. hence, such factorswill lead to significant growth in the globalmarket during the forecast period.  power transformers market: trend    the digitalization of transformers is a major trendshapingthe power transformer market.  a changing power network landscape with new energy sources for power generation and new loads in terms of distribution demands a high level of flexibility and efficiency. ultimately, this has given rise to the digitization of power network assets. as distribution transformers are essential parts of a power network, they are witnessing digitization with the help of advanced sensors, monitoring platforms, and software tools. however, the digitization of transformers allows optimized grid operation, quicker action, and predictive maintenance. all relevant stakeholders in the power network value chain can remain updated on the health of a transformer, thus supporting standardization and lowering unplanned outages. furthermore, the use of data visualization tools for analytical purposes expedites the need for digitization in transformers. such advancements are witnessing rapid penetration in the distribution transformers market. with growing competitive intensity in the global market, the digitalization of power transformers is expected to play a major role in the growth of the market during the forecast period.  to know about

transformers market: market segmentation  the power transformers market is segmented intotype (liquid immersed and dry type), end-user (commercial power, residential power, and industrial power), and geography (apac, europe, north america, middle east and africa, and south america).   the market share growth by the  liquid-immersed segment  will be significant during the forecast period.the use of oil as an insulating medium is more widely prevalent.power transformers are mostly located inside the safe perimeters of a substation or a distribution station, and hence, the probabilities of injuries or fatalities due to any accidents are less when compared with distribution transformers. moreover, due to better-insulating properties and other factors, sf6 gas, which is non-flammable and non-polluting, is also used for insulation, but it is more costly. much of the demand for liquid-immersed power transformers originates from the middle east and apac.increasing population and emerging economies have led to expanded electricity coverage in these regions, especially in the middle east, driving the installation of new grid networks. furthermore,in apac, rapid industrial development in india and china has increased the demand for electricity, leading to increased investment in power infrastructure. in addition to the new installation, the replacement demand for liquid-immersed power transformers is witnessing growth across the regions, mainly in north america and europe. post-financial crisis in 2008, industrial activities gained momentum, which led to increasing investments in power generation in the us and european countries. this directed the expansion of power generation capacities, which resulted in the replacement of the existing power transformers with high-efficient power transformers. thus, such factors are anticipated to drive the liquid-immersed power transformers segment of the global market during the forecast period.     gain instant access to 17,000+

existing transformers is notably driving the power transformer market growth.  factors such as the rise in the installation of new transformers and the replacement of old transformers with new ones are generating growth.globally, the majority of the t&d infrastructure needs renovation, mainly due to the existing networks being unable to meet the growth in the demand for power.for instance, in russia, chelyabenergo, a subsidiary of the utility interregional distribution grid companies (idgc), completed its reconstruction work on the 110/10 kv miass substation in the urals in 2015. such factors are expected to drive the demand for power transformers. in many countries, smart grid networks are also being increasingly used. however, asmart grid refers to an electricity network that provides an economical, sustainable, and secure electricity supply by intelligently integrating the actions of all users, whether they are consumers, generators, or those capable of both in an efficient manner.the use of smart grid systems has allowed utilities to focus on the installation of more power transformers for the effective transmission of electric power. therefore, the need for transformer oil is also rising, with more transformers being installed into the grid. hence, such factorswill lead to significant growth in the globalmarket during the forecast period.   power
