The Leicester City boss was given a booking by official Bobby Madley in the second half of Friday’s 4-1 win over Southampton, his first caution of the campaign. After the match, Maresca revealed that he had been complaining to the fourth official about what he deemed to have been a foul on Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in a dangerous position, prompting Madley to come over and reach for his pocket.

I just complained. It was so clear. At the end, he booked me. He just came and gave me a yellow card, nothing more.” City have received 17 yellow cards in the Championship this season, the fifth-highest total in the division, and there are a trio of players who have already racked up three each: Harry Winks, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, and Jannik Vestergaard. Having been booked three times in six games, those three now have to avoid picking up two yellow cards across City’s next 13 Championship fixtures, otherwise they will be handed a one-match suspension. Stephy Mavididi and Abdul Fatawu have received two yellow cards in the Championship, while Callum Doyle, Mads Hermansen, Ricardo Pereira, and Yunus Akgun have all received one each.
