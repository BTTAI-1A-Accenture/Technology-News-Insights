Kellogg’s has reached its goal of having 50% male and female representation at manager level and above in the UK. This achievement comes three years ahead of schedule, as the goal was due to be reached by the end of 2025. Kellogg’s is a foundational member of the LEAD Network (Leading Executives Advancing Diversity) and David Lawlor, President Kellogg Europe, signed the LEAD CEO Pledge in 2019, to support its commitment to gender parity and to help drive inclusion in the European retail and consumer goods industry. Equity, diversity, and inclusion (ED&I) have always been at the heart of the food company and can be traced back over 100 years to its founder, W.K. Kellogg, who pioneered employing women in the workplace. Kellogg’s has implemented industry leading employee policies, including those focusing on the menopause, pregnancy loss and fertility treatment that the business introduced in 2019. It has also been listed as one of The Times Top 50 Employers for Women 2022 for taking action to decrease gender inequality in the workplace. Chris Silcock, Kellogg’s UK managing director, said: “We are so proud to have reached our target as a result of our intentional focus on gender parity. We have accelerated our efforts around women in leadership and we have invested in developing and promoting female talent throughout our organisation. “I believe we have created an environment and a culture, where our female leaders not only belong but are shaping the future of the business. We have built a pipeline of initiatives to ensure this isn’t just a moment, but a movement for our business and the benefits of making this progress are clear to us.” Melanie Bowes, Kellogg’s UK HR director, said: “Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I) are part of our culture and purpose where everyone has a place at the table. To have reached our 50:50 goal, ahead of schedule, is a testament to the work our teams have been doing to prioritise gender equality in the workplace. Our continued partnership with the LEAD Network, remains as important as ever, to ensure we continue moving in the right direction.” Allyson Zimmermann, CEO, LEAD Network, said: “Employers like Kellogg are a strong example of what commitment to making gender inequality a thing of the past looks like. Since signing the pledge in 2019, Kellogg has been an engaged partner and its results show what can be achieved with focus, investment, and dedication. We call on all employers to be bolder, braver, and faster in achieving the gender parity goal.” Kellogg Company in Europe is getting ready to launch its new employer brand this year. The fresh and impactful new brand heroes the faces and voices of Kellogg employees and centres around the tagline, ‘So, Make it Happen’, which brings to life the opportunities and high-performance culture which exists at the cereal and snacks company. Kellogg aims to create an atmosphere of innovation and inclusion where employees can shape the future of the business, ensuring better days for our planet, our people and our communities. All of this powered by Kellogg’s purpose which is creating better days and a place at the table for everyone. Stay Informed, keep up to date!
