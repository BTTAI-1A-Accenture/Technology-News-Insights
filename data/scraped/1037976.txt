ASHLAND, Ky. (WYMT) - A power company servicing people in 20 counties across Eastern Kentucky is no longer being sold. An agreement selling Kentucky Power from American Electric Power, also known as AEP, to Liberty Utilities has been terminated. “We started this process nearly two years ago, and there have been delays along the way,” Kentucky Power President Cindy Wiseman said. Wiseman said conditions on the agreement, which was worth nearly $3 billion, continued to change as well. With that said, she is confident the company will become increasingly reliable under AEP. “We’re digging in to look at what we can do to help with our rate structure, how we can be a stronger partner than we have been in economic development,” Cindy Wiseman said. Looking to become a stronger partner is also a key component of Wiseman’s leadership plan as president. She was the interim president for the last few months before being named full-time president and chief operating officer. “We’re always looking for ways to improve our reliability. Electricity is a must-have. It’s a driver for economic development. So, that is a top priority as well, and then finding rates affordable,” Cindy Wiseman said. Now that the deal has been terminated, AEP officials look to renew their focus on Eastern Kentucky. “We are working diligently to reimagine our strategy with the goal of not just supporting Kentucky, but being an essential part of its economic and energy future,” said AEP President and CEO Julie Sloat. Kentucky Power officials said customers do not need to take action. There will not be any changes to their account, billing or payment information. Copyright 2023 WYMT. All rights reserved.
