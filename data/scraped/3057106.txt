  Market Dynamics and Factors:  
Because of its propensity to help weight loss, green coffee bean is a popular dietary supplement. Chlorogenic acid helps the body burn glucose and fat, lowers carbohydrate absorption, prevents blood sugar spikes, and balances lipid profile. Green coffee is commonly used to stimulate metabolism, aid in fat burning, and support weight maintenance. However, it also greatly reduces inflammation and fat deposition, which aids in blood sugar normalization and lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Good dietary habits, frequent exercise, and beverages such as green coffee can all help to normalize blood sugar levels.
Customers with higher incomes buy more coffee because they are willing to pay more, demonstrating that a customer's financial condition influences their proclivity to buy a product.
