Observations from Sunday’s Jets practice. WR Allen Lazard was back after missing a few practices due to muscle tightness and made the play of the day, a 20-yard touchdown catch. He outleaped safety Jordan Whitehead for the Aaron Rodgers pass in the back corner of the end zone. On the first series in team drills, Rodgers drew the defensive line offsides twice, a precursor for the uneven practice that featured a high number of penalties and a botched snap by QB Chris Streveler that was recovered by DL Deslin Alexandre. With free agent RB Dalvin Cook in attendance, Zonovan Knight enjoyed a strong practice, breaking off two long runs. If Cook signs with the Jets, it would almost certainly impact Knight’s role on the team. The former undrafted free agent ran with a purpose Sunday. The majority of the day saw Rodgers throwing mostly dump-off passes to his tight ends and running backs. He did hit Lazard for the scoring strike and finished up 9 of 16. There were two drops by Lazard and Michael Carter on the final drive. OT Mekhi Becton (knee) returned to team drills. … WRs Garrett Wilson (low ankle sprain) and Corey Davis (illness) remained out while coach Robert Saleh said Davis would return to practice on Monday. … WR Randall Cobb took part in his first practice coming off the PUP list. He did not take part in team drills.
