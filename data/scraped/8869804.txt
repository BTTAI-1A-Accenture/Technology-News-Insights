 j-Grab Inc. Hello, world! We are j-Grab Mall!
We are a global marketplace dedicated to bringing you the best Japanese products to customers all over the world.   E-commerce Boom Worldwide
Right after the greetings, let’s start with a slightly challenging topic. (It’s better to get this kind of discussion out of the way quickly.) In 2020, due to the pandemic, people around the world were forced to stay at home, and physical stores such as cafes, restaurants, and shops were closed one after another, which had previously brought life and vibrancy to the streets. As a result, the retail sales of these physical stores significantly decreased on a global scale. During this time, the purchasing behavior of many people worldwide shifted into the realm of the internet. Buying and selling products and services online is referred to as “e-commerce”. Even before the pandemic, we were already enjoying online shopping, so it is no longer a novelty. You’re probably familiar with names like Amazon, eBay, Shopee, Lazada, Walmart, AliExpress… at least one of them, I’m sure.
In 2020, e-commerce experienced rapid growth on a global scale, not only through these e-commerce platforms but also through online shops of physical stores that were previously thriving.   E-commerce Outlook for 2023
According to an article on IWConnect, the year 2023 holds promising prospects for e-commerce, driven by the surge in m-commerce and social commerce.  M-commerce refers to online shopping via mobile apps, while social commerce involves e-commerce through social networking sites. With approximately 48% of the global population owning smartphones and 58% identified as social media users, these markets have become significant players. Moreover, regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America, which experienced a slower e-commerce boom in 2020, are now witnessing rapid growth, indicating continued substantial expansion of e-commerce this year.   Features of j-Grab Mall
j-Grab Mall offers 4 unique features that set it apart from other e-commerce platforms:  1. Sales of World-class JAPAN QUALITY products j-Grab Mall provides a wide range of products from various regions in Japan, including Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa.
Our product categories cover Japanese snacks, food, ramen, coffee, green tea, towels, kitchenware, kimono, traditional crafts, fashion, cosmetics, interior decor, collectibles, and practical items. The spirit of Japanese craftsmanship (MONOZUKURI) is rooted in the utmost care and love for consumers.
Focusing on how safe, secure, and truly satisfying consumers can be, Japanese producers create products that are made with the finest materials and ingredients, manufacturing techniques and technologies, and well-thought-out ideas and designs.  2. Touch and “Feel” the Products at j-Grab Mall Showroom Stores (the First in Japan) One common drawback of online shopping is the inability to physically examine products for their smell, texture, taste, or, in the case of cosmetics, their effect on the skin. But fret not!
j-Grab Mall makes it possible! (*1) As of June 2023, j-Grab Mall showroom stores are permanently located in three locations: JAPAN HOUSE Los Angeles (United States), Takashimaya Singapore (JTB) (Singapore), and AEON MALL Mean Chey (Cambodia). “j-Grab Mall showroom store in Singapore, March 2023”
