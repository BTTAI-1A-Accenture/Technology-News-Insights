LT. GOVERNOR DIANNE PRIMAVERA
************************* On June 13, Lt. governor Dianne Primavera announced that the Office of eHealth Innovation (OeHI) has been named a founding member of CancerX, a public-private partnership to advance cancer innovation in the U.S. Announced by the White House Cancer Moonshot in February, CancerX will support the new national goals to “cut the death rate from cancer by at least 50% over the next 25 years and improve the experience of people and their families living with and surviving cancer.”  As a founding member, OeHI will provide input to the strategic direction to establish best practices, capacity-building, and ground-breaking projects. OeHI joins a diverse group of over 90 organizations as a founding member and represents Colorado as the first state to join this initiative. “As someone has been diagnosed with cancer four times, I know just how challenging cancer battles can be for patients, their families, and their finances. I’m excited that OeHI is joining this important national effort and continuing to lead impactful work to improve health outcomes for individuals statewide and across our country,” said Primavera. OeHI and the eHealth Commission continue to accelerate technology-driven health transformation by aligning public and private initiatives to support Colorado’s commitment to become the healthiest state in the nation. Under the direction of Primavera, OeHI has partnered with local health organizations in 55 Colorado counties to support accessible, high quality health care statewide. To date, they have overseen the distribution of over five million dollars in grant funding to support increased broadband connectivity and devices for telehealth access across the state. This fiscal year, Colorado became the first government entity collaborator with the In Full Health initiative through the American Medical Association. In Full Health is “committed to advancing equitable opportunities in health innovation investment, solution development, and purchasing.” As a collaborator, OeHI works with national leaders to develop and distribute best practices and resources to inform the development and use of products to meaningfully advance health equity. Primaver, OeHI’s director Stephanie Pugliese, and eHealth commission chair Kaakpema “KP” Yelpaala discuss this collaboration and other progress toward equitable health innovation in the latest InOn Health podcast.
