This man-bites-dog scenario unfolded in Pomona, New York, where the Tri-City ValleyCats were visiting the New York Boulders in a Frontier League game. As detailed by the Albany Times Union, first base umpire Warren Nicholson was tossed in the first inning after arguing with Bounders second baseman Tucker Nathans, and ultimately being restrained by other officials. The ValleyCats â€“ a team managed by former Philadelphia Phillies slugger Pete Incaviglia â€“ had accused the Boulders of illegally using outfield cameras to steal signs, leading Nicholson to remove league-sanctioned computer equipment from the home team's dugout. That moved sparked an argument between Nicholson and Nathans, the latter of whom was promptly ejected.

Following the confrontation, Nicholson was seen exiting the ballpark through an opening in the outfield wall in left. The game then experienced an hour-long delay as a camera was removed from center field. 'Your manager in Tri-City has been accusing us of stealing signs for three days, which is offensive and embarrassing at the same time,' Boulders team president Shawn Reilly said in a statement.Â  'The umpire went over based on Pete [Incaviglia] and he threw [Nathans] out and things got out of control.Â  'It's unfortunate. It was not a good moment for the league. It was an embarrassing moment and it should never have happened.'

Frontier League Deputy Commissioner Steve Tahsler responded to the incident in a statement provided to DailyMail.com.Â  'The Frontier League is embarrassed and upset about the delay in last night's game at Clover Stadium,' Tahsler said.Â  'We apologize to the fans who had to observe these actions. Unfortunately, our league staff was at other games last night. We have had multiple conversations with all parties involved. An internal investigation is underway.'
