 A sudden drop in blood pressure, also called hypotension, can occur for any number of reasons. It may be due to dehydration or simply rising from your chair too quickly, causing momentary dizziness and confusion. But a sudden drop in blood pressure could also be a sign of a potentially serious condition like heart problems, heatstroke, or internal bleeding.
  This article will discuss the various causes of sudden hypotension and how a sudden drop in blood pressure is diagnosed and treated. It also explains when it is time to see a healthcare provider and the signs of a medical emergency.
  There are many possible causes of hypotension. Some can overlap, making the diagnosis difficult in some cases. The causes can be broadly categorized as hypovolemia, decreased cardiac output, vasodilation, and hypotensive syndromes.
  Hypovolemia is a term used to describe reduced blood volume. This is the most common cause of hypotension. It can occur if you are not getting enough fluids or if your body is losing too much fluid.
  Common causes of hypovolemia include:
 Hypovolemic shock occurs when you lose more than 20% of your blood volume for any reason. A loss at this level makes it impossible for the heart to pump a sufficient amount of blood through the body.  Even if your blood volume is normal, there are conditions that can reduce the body's ability to pump blood. This condition is known as decreased cardiac output.
  It can occur as a result of a heart problem, endocrine (hormonal) dysfunction, and certain medications. Sudden changes in cardiac output can cause a sudden drop in blood pressure.
  Causes of decreased cardiac output include.
  Vasodilation describes the sudden widening of blood vessels. As the blood vessels get wider, blood pressure continues to drop.
  Common causes of vasodilation include:
  Hypotensive syndrome is the term used when more than one factor causes a sudden drop in blood pressure. Usually a person has an underlying condition that is then triggered by doing something such as standing up after sitting or experiencing severe emotional distress.
  Hypotensive syndromes tend to come on suddenly, sometimes with dramatic symptoms, including extreme dizziness and unconsciousness.
  Some common hypotensive syndromes include:
  A blood pressure cuff called a sphygmomanometer can tell you how low your blood pressure is, but it can't tell you what caused the sudden drop.
  For this, the doctor will need to review your medical history, family history, current symptoms, and medications. Then they will perform some of the following tests to figure out the cause:
  Generally speaking, if you have recurrent symptoms of hypotension, even if symptoms are relatively mild (such as dizziness when rising from a chair), it is in your best interest to see a healthcare provider.
  On the other hand, you need to call 911 or seek immediate emergency if you experience signs of shock. When this happens, your blood pressure has dropped so steeply that organs are deprived of adequate blood flow and oxygen, causing symptoms like:
 Call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room if signs of shock develop. If left untreated, shock can lead to permanent organ damage, cardiac arrest, and even death.  The treatment of acute hypotension varies based on the underlying cause. If the condition is not a medical emergency, you should either sit or lie down immediately and raise your feet above heart level. If you are dehydrated, you should replenish lost fluids and seek immediate medical attention if the symptoms are severe.
  If hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock is involved, you may be given an intravenous (IV) saline solution or a blood transfusion. Septic shock may require IV antibiotics, while anaphylactic shock requires epinephrine (adrenaline).
  If hypotension is related to extreme vasodilation or decreased cardiac output, medications such as vasodilators (like midodrine) or drugs to stimulate the heart (like digitalis) may be prescribed to improve heart function and output.
  People with severe postural hypotension may benefit from the use of the anti-inflammatory steroid fludrocortisone.
 Compression socks are often prescribed for people with orthostatic hypotension to prevent the pooling of blood in the legs. Wearing them keeps more blood in the upper body.  A sudden drop in blood pressure can occur for a variety of reasons. Some of these are not serious. In some cases, though, it may be a sign of something more serious, and even life-threatening. Serious underlying causes usually have other symptoms.
  It is important not to ignore signs of hypotension. This is especially true if the drop is sudden and severe. Hypotension can often be treated successfully. The underlying cause, on the other hand, may require extensive treatment by a specialist, such as a cardiologist, neurologist, or endocrinologist.
