 As a #managementconsulting professional at DSV Consulting, I have a passion for creating and executing #businessplans across various industries. However, since I joined the #cybersecurity industry with ThreatGEN three years ago, I have realized that there is a crucial step that I have overlooked in my planning process: using tabletop exercises (#TTX) to test the validity and effectiveness of my plans and procedures. In this article, I will focus on how TTX can help improve cybersecurity outcomes, as well as their benefits, limitations, and the next level of innovation. I will also discuss how TTX can be applied to other types of business plans in future articles. [Bing generated] Tabletop exercises in the cybersecurity area are simulations of cyber crisis situations that test the human and managerial factors, rather than technical defenses, to a potential #cyberattack. They help organizations devise #bestpractices to respond to detected threats and unfolding attacks, should they occur. They also help validate existing #incidentresponse plans and expose weaknesses that can lead to improvement. The typical format for tabletop training involves: Tabletop exercises can be completed in as little as 15 minutes and are a convenient tool for putting your team in the cybersecurity mindset. There are also various resources and templates available to assist stakeholders in conducting their own exercises. [Bing generated] Cybersecurity tabletop exercises have many benefits for an organization, such as: Tabletop exercises are a valuable tool for enhancing the organization’s cybersecurity posture and resilience.

As I said earlier in this article, I work directly with ThreatGEN and ThreatGEN founder & President Clint Bodungen and believe that the ThreatGEN® Red vs. Blue product embodies the greatest innovation in #cybersecurity #TTX available. Here is an excerpt from the website: ThreatGEN’s multitude of benefits the TTX platform include: Building on these REAL benefits of ThreatGEN today, one can imagine these possible benefits: Tabletop exercises can be useful in contexts other than #cybersecurity, such as an effective way to test #businessplans in various scenarios and situations. They could: In conclusion, the #managementconsulting community has been caught flat footed when it comes to simulating and using a feedback loop to make business plans more effective. I will be writing more articles focused on that specific #usecase for #TTX, in the vain of capturing the #innovation that ThreatGEN has already delivered to the #cybersecurity community!
