"Tom kind of got flagrant. He was brazen after he told me he was in love. It was like a release for him." Tom Schwartz showed up on Watch What Happens Live last night, and he did not hold back when it came to dishing about Tom Sandoval and Raquel Leviss' affair. And, um, he revealed exactly when he found out 👀. “I learned about the affair in August,” Schwartz said, explaining that Sandoval and Raquel had a one-night stand that lead to an emotional affair. “The one-night stand was in August and then it became, from my point of view, it became an emotional affair. Which is still inappropriate but I didn’t think it was linear. In January, he came to me and told me that he was in love with Raquel.”  “Tom kind of got flagrant. He was brazen after he told me he was in love. It was like a release for him,” he explained, adding that Sandoval promised he'd do the "right thing" by Ariana Madix, but kept "procrastinating." Schwartz went on to say that Raquel is Sandoval's “heroin” and that he's “infatuated” with her. Buuuuuuut he doesn't think they'll last.  "I think it'll be a miracle if they make it," he said. "Their relationship is, you know, I know they care so much about each other but, like, even in the short time they've been in love — or whatever you want to call it — it's become toxic, and I don't know if it's sustainable. It's already toxic as it is, and then you add in, you know, the entire nation thinking, You guys are scumbags. I think it's too much." Indeed!
