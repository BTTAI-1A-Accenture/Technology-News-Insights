Second quarter financial results exceed previously announced guidance
 SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GoodRx Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: GDRX) (“GoodRx” or the “Company”), a leading resource for healthcare savings and information, has released its financial results for the second quarter 2023.

  
Second Quarter 2023 Highlights
 
“I’m encouraged by the progress made during the second quarter,” said Scott Wagner, Interim Chief Executive Officer. “We exceeded our Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA expectations with prescription transactions revenue and volume returning to year-over-year growth. We expanded the number of direct contracts we have with pharmacies, announced an exciting new program with CVS Caremark, and continued to align our teams and people against our biggest opportunities. Looking ahead, we are focused on rebuilding momentum in the business financially and operationally with an eye toward compounding growth in 2024 and beyond.”

Q2‘23 net income was impacted by $17.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $5.7 million of which related to the non-recurring awards granted to our co-founders in connection with our IPO, and a $46.7 million tax benefit principally from the release of our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets.

Second Quarter 2023 Financial Overview (all comparisons are made to the same period of the prior year unless otherwise noted):
 
Total revenue decreased 1% to $189.7 million compared to $191.8 million. Prescription transactions revenue increased 2% to $136.5 million compared to $134.4 million, primarily driven by a 5% increase in Monthly Active Consumers, partially offset by an ongoing shift in the volume of prescription transactions to certain retailers with lower pricing principally due to the sustained impact of the grocer issue. Pharma manufacturer solutions revenue decreased 8% to $24.3 million compared to $26.6 million, primarily driven by our increased focus on prioritizing service arrangements with high levels of recurring revenue potential and moderation in spending across pharma manufacturers, partially offset by revenue contribution from vitaCare, which we acquired in April 2022. Subscription revenue decreased 8% to $23.9 million compared to $26.0 million, primarily driven by a 14% decrease in subscription plans as of June 30, 2023, largely as a result of the sunset of our partnership subscription program, Kroger Savings Club, partially offset by the effects of the pricing increase for Gold subscribers in the first half of 2022. Other revenue stayed relatively flat year-over-year.

 
Cost of revenues decreased 9% to $16.3 million, or 9% of revenue, compared to $18.0 million, or 9% of revenue, primarily driven by a decrease in fulfillment costs for certain solutions provided to customers under our pharma manufacturer solutions offering. Adjusted cost of revenues2 decreased 10% to $16.1 million, or 9% of revenue, compared to $17.9 million, or 9% of revenue.

 
Product development and technology expenses decreased 12% to $31.3 million, or 16% of revenue, compared to $35.4 million, or 18% of revenue, primarily driven by a decrease in payroll and related costs due to lower average headcount and higher capitalization of certain qualified costs related to software development. Adjusted product development and technology expenses2 decreased 6% to $23.5 million, or 12% of revenue, compared to $25.0 million, or 13% of revenue.

 
Sales and marketing expenses decreased 18% to $77.4 million, or 41% of revenue, compared to $94.3 million, or 49% of revenue, primarily driven by a decrease in payroll and related costs due to a reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expense as certain performance milestones were no longer probable of being met and lower average headcount as well as a net decrease in advertising and promotional expenses as we proactively managed our spend to better align with our strategic goals and future scale. Adjusted sales and marketing expenses2 decreased 7% to $80.4 million, or 42% of revenue, compared to $86.9 million, or 45% of revenue.

 
General and administrative expenses decreased 13% to $30.2 million, or 16% of revenue, compared to $34.7 million, or 18% of revenue, primarily driven by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to our co-founders awards, partially offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses. Adjusted general and administrative expenses2 increased 10% to $16.2 million, or 9% of revenue, compared to $14.7 million, or 8% of revenue.

 
Net income was $58.8 million compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, primarily driven by an increase in our income tax benefit of $46.7 million, compared to $8.7 million, due to the discrete release of $55.9 million of our beginning-of-the-year valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Net income margin was 31.0% compared to a net loss margin of 0.7%. Adjusted Net Income2 was $28.4 million compared to Adjusted Net Income of $27.2 million.

 
Adjusted EBITDA2 was $53.5 million compared to $47.2 million, primarily driven by a decrease in sales and marketing spend, partially offset by the impact of the grocer issue. Adjusted EBITDA Margin2 was 28.2% compared to 24.6%.

 
Cash Flow and Capital Allocation
 
Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $29.9 million compared to $51.0 million in the comparable period last year, largely driven by a change to net income from net loss, offset by a decrease in non-cash adjustments and an increase in cash outflows from working capital changes. The decrease in non-cash adjustments was primarily driven by an increase in deferred income tax as a result of the discrete release of substantially the entirety of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and a year-over-year decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to our co-founders’ awards. The changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by the timing of income tax payments and refunds, as well as by the timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and collections of accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2023, GoodRx had cash and cash equivalents of $762.0 million and total outstanding debt of $663.6 million.

 
GoodRx is focused on a disciplined approach to capital allocation, centered on furthering the Company’s mission and creating shareholder value. Our capital allocation priorities are investing for profitable growth, paying down debt, buying back shares, and M&A that aligns with our strategic priorities. These priorities support GoodRx’s long-term growth strategy while also providing flexibility to navigate near-term challenges.

 
Share Repurchases
 
During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased $8.9 million in shares of Class A common stock, representing approximately 1.7 million shares. As of June 30, 2023, we had $129.8 million remaining of our $250.0 million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors during the first quarter 2022.

“We are guiding to third quarter revenue in the range of $186 million to $190 million and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in the mid-to-high twenty-percent range,” said Karsten Voermann, Chief Financial Officer. “In the back half of this year, we’ll continue to balance business imperatives for 2024 and beyond with immediate results. For our pharma manufacturer solutions offering specifically, we are becoming more focused on what we’re selling and to whom. In connection with that, we have taken certain actions to see cost savings, for example at vitaCare, that we expect will translate into incremental Adjusted EBITDA in the low-to-mid-single-digit millions of dollars range but also some revenue attenuation relative to our previous perspectives and 2023 guidance as a result. We're also making volume vs. margin trade-offs in our direct contracting approach with retailers that may lead to a short-term headwind for prescription transactions revenue growth. These assumptions are reflected in our guidance.”

 
“Our balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong in the second quarter, while generating healthy cash flow from operations. We will continue to prioritize cash conversion and disciplined capital deployment to support our strategic priorities and accelerate value creation,” concluded Voermann.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure and is presented for supplemental informational purposes only. We have not reconciled our Adjusted EBITDA Margin guidance to GAAP net income or loss margin, because we do not provide guidance for GAAP net income or loss margin due to the uncertainty and potential variability of stock-based compensation expense, acquired intangible assets and related amortization and income taxes, which are reconciling items between Adjusted EBITDA Margin and GAAP net income or loss margin. Because such items cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure. However, such items could have a significant impact on our future GAAP net income or loss margin.

Key Operating Metrics
 
Monthly Active Consumers (MACs) refers to the number of unique consumers who have used a GoodRx code to purchase a prescription medication in a given calendar month and have saved money compared to the list price of the medication. A unique consumer who uses a GoodRx code more than once in a calendar month to purchase prescription medications is only counted as one Monthly Active Consumer in that month. A unique consumer who uses a GoodRx code in two or three calendar months within a quarter will be counted as a Monthly Active Consumer in each such month. Monthly Active Consumers do not include subscribers to our subscription offerings, consumers of our pharma manufacturer solutions offering, or consumers who use our telehealth offerings. When presented for a period longer than a month, Monthly Active Consumers are averaged over the number of calendar months in such period. Monthly Active Consumers from acquired companies are only included beginning in the first full quarter following the acquisition.

 
Subscription plans represent the ending subscription plan balance across both of our subscription offerings, GoodRx Gold and Kroger Savings Club. Each subscription plan may represent more than one subscriber since family subscription plans may include multiple members.

 
We exited the second quarter of 2023 with over 7 million prescription-related consumers that used GoodRx across our prescription transactions and subscription offerings. Our prescription-related consumers represent the sum of Monthly Active Consumers for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and subscribers to our subscription plans as of June 30, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Margin and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. We also present each cost and operating expense on our condensed consolidated statements of operations on an adjusted basis to arrive at adjusted operating income. Collectively, we refer to these non-GAAP financial measures as our “Non-GAAP Measures."

 
We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and as further adjusted for, as applicable for the periods presented, acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, financing related expenses, loss on operating lease assets, restructuring related expenses, legal settlement expenses, charitable stock donation, gain on sale of business, and other income or expense, net. Adjusted EBITDA Margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

 
We define Adjusted Net Income for a particular period as net income or loss adjusted for, as applicable for the periods presented, amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, acquisition related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, financing related expenses, loss on operating lease assets, restructuring related expenses, legal settlement expenses, charitable stock donation, gain on sale of business, other expense, and as further adjusted for estimated income tax on such adjusted items. Our adjusted taxes also excludes (i) the valuation allowance recorded against certain of our net deferred tax assets that was recognized in accordance with GAAP and any subsequent releases of the valuation allowance, and (ii) all tax benefits/expenses resulting from excess tax benefits/deficiencies in connection with stock-based compensation. Adjusted Net Income Margin represents Adjusted Net Income as a percentage of revenue.

 
Adjusted Earnings Per Share is Adjusted Net Income attributable to common stockholders divided by weighted average number of shares. The weighted average shares we use in computing Adjusted Earnings Per Share – basic is equal to our GAAP weighted average shares – basic and the weighted average shares we use in computing Adjusted Earnings Per Share – diluted is equal to either GAAP weighted average shares – basic or GAAP weighted average shares – diluted, depending on whether we have adjusted net loss or adjusted net income, respectively.

 
We also assess our performance by evaluating each cost and operating expense on our condensed consolidated statements of operations on a non-GAAP, or adjusted, basis to arrive at adjusted operating income. The adjustments to these cost and operating expense items include, as applicable for the periods presented, acquisition related expenses, amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, loss on extinguishment of debt, financing related expenses, restructuring related expenses, legal settlement expenses, loss on operating lease assets, charitable stock donation, other expense, and gain on sale of business. Adjusted operating income is GAAP revenue less non-GAAP costs and operating expenses.

 
We believe our Non-GAAP Measures are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties because they assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are also key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance.

 
The Non-GAAP Measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Other companies, including other companies in our industry, may not use these measures or may calculate these measures differently than as presented herein, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

 
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA, and presents net income (loss) margin, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, with Adjusted EBITDA Margin:
