GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (KSNB) - April 4 is also known as National Hug a Newsperson Day. Local4′s Kasey Mintz got to partake in the fun as a few members of the Bickford Senior Living Community stopped by the Grand Island bureau to give him a gift basket and candy. If you can’t hug a newsperson, there are a few other ways to show appreciation for those reporting the news, including sending a virtual hug or using #huganewspersonday on your social media posts giving Local4 a shout out.
