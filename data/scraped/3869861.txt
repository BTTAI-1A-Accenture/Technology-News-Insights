Digital health layoffs have been on the rise since last year. As interest rates skyrocketed, investors started to pull back on funding, leading companies to slash staff to preserve cash. But this year's layoffs have outpaced 2022. Thirty-three digital health startups have cut staff this year. Business Insider previously tracked 26 startups that laid off employees across 2022. Many of the startups that are cutting employees were last valued at $1 billion or more. Their layoffs are another signal of how previously high-flying companies that notched inflated valuations are now hunkering down to survive the funding slump. Some companies that did layoffs last year will be forced to make more cuts this year to stay afloat and avoid raising a down round, said Andreessen Horowitz general partner Julie Yoo in January. "Unfortunately, the average company tends to not cut enough the first time," she told Business Insider. "Companies will go through multiple rounds of layoffs as the market signals don't turn significantly better, and they'll have to continue to extend their runway if they're trying to avoid raising a round that they believe will be punitive in some form."
