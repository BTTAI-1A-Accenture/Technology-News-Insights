Pune, India, March  06, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --        According to a report by Fortune Business Insights titled "Voluntary Carbon Offset Market, 2023-2030", the global market for voluntary carbon offset is expected to experience growth due to the rising incidence of respiratory illnesses. Voluntary carbon offsets have long been recognized as a method for decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Voluntary carbon offsets market is a system that allows individuals, organizations, and businesses to purchase carbon credits to offset their carbon emissions. Carbon offsets represent a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gas emissions that have been made elsewhere, such as through renewable energy projects, reforestation, or energy efficiency initiatives.

By purchasing carbon offsets, individuals and organizations can offset their own emissions by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere, essentially balancing out their own carbon footprint. The industry has seen significant growth in recent years due to the increasing awareness of climate change and the need to reduce carbon emissions. The industry is expected to continue growing as more individuals and companies seek to reduce their carbon footprint and take action to combat climate change. However, the industry also faces challenges such as the lack of standardization and verification of carbon credits, which can lead to concerns about the effectiveness of carbon offset projects. Market Drivers & Restraints: Increasing CO2 emissions to boost the market  The demand for voluntary carbon offsets has risen due to the rapid increase in CO2 emissions, which have caused harm to both human health and the environment. The resultant climate change and pollution of air, water, and soil have led to a surge in respiratory illnesses, making voluntary carbon offsets a preferred solution to counter greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, supportive government initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions are expected to boost the demand for voluntary carbon offsets, driving market growth during the forecast period. However, the adoption of compliance emission reductions (CERs) and verified emission reductions (VERs) as alternative projects to decrease CO2 emissions may reduce the adoption of voluntary carbon offsets and limit the market's growth.                   COVID-19 had a Potential Impact On Market The COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact could have had a significant effect on global carbon markets. However, despite initial price reductions due to lower demand, the markets demonstrated impressive resilience and returned to nearly normal functioning. While the rise in carbon emissions is alarming, several major carbon-emitting countries have unveiled long-term environmental policies to support economic recovery from the pandemic and eventually achieve carbon neutrality.
