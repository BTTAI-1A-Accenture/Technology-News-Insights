The Tampa Bay Rays (82-54) and the Cleveland Guardians (66-70) wrap up a 3-game series Sunday at Progressive Field. First pitch is scheduled for 4:10 p.m. ET. Let’s analyze BetMGM Sportsbook’s lines around the Rays vs. Guardians odds and make our expert MLB picks and predictions for the best bets. Season series: Guardians lead 3-2 The Rays have dropped a pair of 1-run games in the 1st 2 games of this series, including a 3-2 loss in the series opener Friday with ace RHP Tyler Glasnow on the bump. The Guardians posted the 7-6 win in 11 innings on Saturday, as OF Steven Kwan had a sacrifice fly to drive in the winning run. The Guardians have won 4 straight games, all as an underdog, tying the longest win streak of the season. Cleveland has climbed back to within 5 games of the Minnesota Twins in the AL West Division. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay has slipped 2 1/2 games back of the Baltimore Orioles for 1st place in the AL East. RHP Taj Bradley vs. RHP Xzavion Curry Bradley (5-7, 5.67 ERA) makes his 17th start. He has a 1.41 WHIP, 3.1 BB/9 and 11.9 K/9 in 74 2/3 innings. Curry (3-3, 4.10 ERA) makes his 9th start and 34th overall appearance. He has a 1.28 WHIP, 2.5 BB/9 and 6.3 K/9 in 79 innings.

Guardians 6, Rays 4 Moneyline The GUARDIANS (+120) are a solid play behind Curry, as Cleveland looks to cap off the surprising 3-game sweep of the contending Rays (-145). I don’t trust Bradley, who returns from Triple-A Durham to make the start Sunday. He hasn’t pitched in the bigs since late July. After being banished to run with the Bulls, Bradley had a modicum of success, posting a 2.91 ERA in 21 2/3 IP in 5 minor-league starts. Still, we need to see him do it at the major-league level on a consistent basis before trusting him again. The GUARDIANS +1.5 (-145) is a decent play if you just can’t fathom the idea of another Cleveland win for the 3-game sweep. I like Curry, and think the pitching edge is tipped in Cleveland’s favor. However, if you would like a little insurance, the Guardians aren’t priced out of line. OVER 9 (+100) is the lean, but go lightly. No one will confuse a Bradley vs. Curry matchup for a pitcher’s duel. Both of these pitchers should cough up plenty of runs. The Over is 3-2 in the last 5 games for Tampa Bay and 9-4 in the last 13 games. For Cleveland, the Over has a slight 4-3 edge across the last 7 games. The Over cashed in Curry’s start in St. Petersburg against the Rays on Aug. 11, too. For more sports betting picks and tips, check out SportsbookWire.com and BetFTW. Follow Kevin J.
