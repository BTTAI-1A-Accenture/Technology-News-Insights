According to Pal, anger, resentment, fear, and resentment are all at an all-time high at the moment. Pal says the crypto space is bullish because institutional investors are increasingly adopting it, and big tech is increasingly intertwining with the crypto industry. Long-term crypto investing is the approach that Pal recommends to investors, urging them to buy during panic selling phases and hold onto their coins in order to benefit in the future.
