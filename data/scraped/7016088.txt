 LAURA INGRAHAM (FOX NEWS HOST): The bottom line is this. Trump was charged with two counts of conspiracy and two counts of obstruction of an official proceeding for adopting and pressing an unconventional and controversial legal view that the electors in this presidential race could be replaced with new electors. Well, the indictment, according to that analysis, is a complete sham. If this is how low the bar is set going forward, then Smith and Garland and every prosecutor who pushed this fraud of a case should all expect to face similar treatment to what they're putting Trump through. In this indictment, the drama queens in Smith's office claim that Trump was determined to remain in power in conspiracies that targeted a bedrock function of the United States federal government. The nation's process of collecting, counting, and certifying the results of the presidential election. Now, again, by this same logic, an aggressive Republican lawyer could argue that the Biden prosecutors themselves are the ones currently conspiring to target a bedrock function of the U.S. government. In this case, the 2024 presidential election. I have another question here. Why did it take Jack Smith's office two years or so to file this indictment? Well, we all know why, don't we? Because it's a political weapon that is most effectively used as the 2024 campaign is just heating up, but Hell will have no fury like a Republican-controlled DOJ after this fiasco. I'm telling you that, but journalists who know better, they are so overcome with TLD, Trump Loathing Disorder, that they don't even notice the irony and the double standard staring them in the face. [...] INGRAHAM: With their relentless and baseless persecution of Trump using these wild legal theories, Garland and Smith, they're the ones seeking to deny voters of their right to vote for the candidate of their choosing, in this case, Donald Trump. And for that matter, why shouldn't President Biden and his pals face the same fate after he leaves office? Because, again, we're just applying their standard. The Jack Smith standard of criminal federal criminal prosecution, apply that here, and one could argue that Joe's lies about not knowing Hunter's foreign clients and the DOJ slow-walking of the Hunter Biden investigation, both of those things altered the democratic process. How, you might ask? By depriving voters of material facts that they needed before the election, and I'm telling you, I was thinking today, plenty of possibilities for unindicted co-conspirators there. So you see where this is all going to lead, right? A never-ending carousel of prosecutions by one party in power against the party out of power. Talk about corrosive. America starts looking more like Pakistan or, I don't know, Venezuela?
