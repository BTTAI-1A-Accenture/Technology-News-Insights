Xiaomi Redmi Android Announcement
 The Redmi Note 12 series unveiled in October consists of four smartphones - Redmi Note 12, Redmi Note 12 Pro, Redmi Note 12 Pro+, and Redmi Note 12 Discovery (aka Explorer). Today Redmi added a fifth member to the lineup, dubbed Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition. While the name might suggest that the Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition charges faster than the Redmi Note 12 Pro that comes with 67W wired charging, that's not the case since the Speed Edition also charges at the same speed. It also packs a 5,000 mAh battery like the non-Speed model and supports QC 3+, PD 2.0, and PD 3.0 charging protocols. The Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition also looks similar to the Note 12 Pro. Redmi just tweaked the camera island's design a bit and moved the Redmi branding from the bottom to the top. It actually looks like a Poco smartphone, and we wouldn't be surprised if it's launched under the Poco brand in some markets outside China. It's also worth mentioning that while the Note 12 Pro Speed Edition shares the dimensions and battery size with the non-Speed version, it is six grams lighter than the Note 12 Pro at 181g. 


Redmi Note 12 Pro • Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition That said, the major differences between the Redmi Note 12 Pro and Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition are in the chipset and camera departments. The Redmi Note 12 Pro is powered by the Dimensity 1080 SoC and sports a 50MP primary camera, while the Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition has the Snapdragon 778G chip at the helm and features a 108MP Samsung ISOCELL HM2 camera (no OIS, though). It's joined by 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro units. The rest of the Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition's highlights include a 6.67" FullHD+ 120Hz 10bit OLED display, a 16MP selfie camera, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner. It has 5G connectivity and an NFC chip onboard. You also get a USB-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and support for Hi-Res Audio (wired/wireless) and Dolby Vision. Moreover, it comes with stereo speakers, X-axis linear motor, and an IP53 rating. Unlike the Redmi Note 12 Pro, which runs Android 12-based MIUI 13 out of the box, the Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition boots MIUI 14 based on Android 13. It comes in black, blue, and green colors and has three memory options - 6GB/128GB, 8GB/256GB, and 12GB/256GB (6GB model only comes in black color). The 6GB variant is priced at CNY1,699 ($245/€230), and the 8GB model at CNY1,799 ($260/€245). The 12GB version will cost you CNY1,999 ($285/€270). The Redmi Note 12 Pro Speed Edition will be sold in China through Xiaomi's official Chinese website, but there's no word on its availability in other markets. Source (in Chinese) Just add back the microSD slot for global version (like they did for non-Pro) and I'm sold.
