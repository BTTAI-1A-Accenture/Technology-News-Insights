       Targa Resources Corp. is bullishly pushing forward with expansion projects in the prolific Permian Basin, citing expectations for robust global oil and natural gas demand long term The Houston-based company expects momentum to push through 2023, a year in which global oil demand is projected by the International Energy Agency to grow and foundations are being built for long-term natural gas needs in the United States and globally.  This notably includes Europe, which has become reliant on American supplies of LNG, and developed amid Russia’s year-long war in Ukraine. This hastened the continent’s need to ditch dependence on Kremlin-backed gas. U.S. liquefied natural gas is expected to help fill the void for years to come. “We expect our momentum to continue through 2023 and beyond given the strength of the business fundamentals underpinning our assets,” CEO Matthew Meloy said during a call with analysts to discuss fourth quarter results. “Major projects came online on time, on budget and have been highly utilized since start-up.” Start ups last year included the 275 MMcf/d Legacy plant in the Permian Midland and the 230 MMcf/d Red Hills VI plant in the Permian Delaware. Targa reported record natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline transportation and fractionation volumes for the fourth quarter, driven largely by higher supply from its Permian gathering and processing systems. Additionally, among other projects, the 275 MMcf/d Legacy II plant and the 275 MMcf/d Greenwood plant in the Permian are on track to begin operations this year. In January, the company agreed to purchase Blackstone Energy Partners’ 25% interest in Targa’s Grand Prix NGL pipeline for $1.05 billion. The transaction is slated to close by the end of March. It would give Targa a 100% ownership position in the 1.0 million b/d capacity NGL pipeline. Targa last year paid $3.55 billion to acquire Lucid Energy Delaware LLC. Lucid, which provides natural gas gathering, treating and processing services in the Delaware, gave Targa 1,050 miles of natural gas pipelines and about 1.4 Bcf/d of cryogenic gas processing capacity in service or under construction.   Targa noted that in response to increasing production and to meet the infrastructure needs of producers, it planned to transfer an existing cryogenic natural gas processing plant to the Delaware from South Texas. The plant would be installed as a new 230 MMcf/d facility. The Roadrunner II plant is expected to begin operations by mid 2024. “Beyond those projects already announced, and in progress, we are evaluating when we will need additional gas processing capacity in the Permian, and we are ordering long lead time items,” Meloy said. The upbeat assessment comes as U.S. oil production reached a pandemic-era high of 12.3 million b/d in January, according to the Energy Information Administration. Natural gas production, meanwhile, hit a record above 102 Bcf/d late in 2022 and has held near that level since, according to Bloomberg estimates. Targa reported 4Q2022 net income of $318 million, up from a loss of $313.6 million a year ago. Full-year net income was $1.2 billion, versus $71.2 million in 2021.

 Southwestern Energy Co. continues to focus on decreasing dry gas completion activity, which includes releasing a hydraulic fracturing fleet in the Haynesville Shale, while maintaining its liquids-rich activity level in West Virginia and Ohio. Canadian oil and natural gas employment remained lean in 2022 as the industry directed price gains into shareholder benefits, debt repayments and efficiency programs, according to a recent labor market report. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved a 732-mile transmission line across federal lands to move wind energy to Nevada from Wyoming.  Brent crude oil prices are poised to average $86/bbl for the remainder of 2023 before falling to an average of $81 in 2024 amid rising global inventories, according to the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest projections. Kinder Morgan Inc.’s (KMI) renewable diesel (RD) hub projects in California are in full commercial operation, which may be the first to transport the alternative fuel by pipeline to inland destinations. Norway’s Yara International ASA has signaled it may join Enbridge Inc. to develop a blue ammonia project on the Texas coast near Corpus Christi.  Believing that transparent markets empower businesses, economies, and communities, Natural Gas Intelligence (NGI) provides natural gas price transparency and key news, insights, and data for the North American energy markets.
