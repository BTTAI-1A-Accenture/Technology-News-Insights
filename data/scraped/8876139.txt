     Shopify is expanding its bet on bricks-and-mortar in Canada with new point-of-sale hardware. Following a U.S. launch last year, the company is bringing its POS Go technology to Canadian businesses starting this week. Offline commerce is one of Shopify’s top priorities, as demand for physical retail rises and e-commerce slows. In-person shopping has bounced back since the pandemic, though Shopify believes customers are keen to research products online before heading to stores to pick them up. The company says its point-of-sale transactions grew 31% in the first quarter.

             Shopify Inc. is launching new point-of-sale hardware in Canada, as it aims to widen its offerings for brick-and-mortar stores amid a slowdown in e-commerce growth that has weighed on the company’s results.

The retail technology, dubbed POS Go, was first introduced in the United States last year. It will be made available for Canadian businesses starting this week, with an option for translation services in French geared toward merchants in Quebec.

“Gaining share in offline commerce is one of Shopify’s top strategic priorities,” said Arpan Podduturi, vice-president of product for the Ottawa-based company, adding that demand for physical retail has increased steadily as of late.

             Shopify is one of my favourite Canadian companies. The changing business will helpfully prove the company is here to stay and will not go the way of Blackberry and Nortel.
