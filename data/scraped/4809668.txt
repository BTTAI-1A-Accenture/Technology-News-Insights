The official launch party will be on Saturday, September 23 The Piper nightclub is currently undergoing a massive refurbishment with hopes of establishing the legendary Hull venue as one of the best clubs in the north. Set to be a truly stunning, practically new venue, the refurbishment will seriously upgrade the venue’s sound, lighting and visuals. The instalment of the 360-degree, Boiler Room-style DJ booth will allow ravers to get up close and personal with their favourite big name DJs. The Newland Avenue venue also features VIP booth seating, spacious toilet facilities, and a nearby taxi rank. It is hoped that this will attract locals and out-of-town clubbers to the dance floor where they can share memories with their friends to the soundtrack of banging tunes.
