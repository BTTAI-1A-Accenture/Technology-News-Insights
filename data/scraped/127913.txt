Alcoa football held off a late Bearden charge to win 17-13 on Friday night. However, most will be talking about the lights going out while Bearden was driving downfield for a potential game-winning score. The lights at Alcoa's stadium went out for nine minutes after a Bearden incomplete pass with 38 seconds left in the game. It is not known why the lights went out. "Honestly, I was thinking like the Super Bowl between the Ravens and 49ers," Alcoa's Eli Owens said. "But you know, it was God. It was almost like a second halftime. "I think it helped both teams. I think any type of break in a game like (Friday) is helpful for anybody." Bearden restarted its offense after the lights came back on. And the Bulldogs couldn't find the end zone. Alcoa improved to 2-0 with both wins over Class 6A programs. The eight-time defending Class 3A state champions beat Ravenwood in Week 1. Bearden fell to 0-2 with losses to two defending state champions. The Bulldogs lost to 2022 Class 5A state champion West in Week 1.
