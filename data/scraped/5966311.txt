     CyberGuy explains why vintage tech is making a comeback. Technology advances faster than we can keep up. The number of devices we have access to and what they can do for us can be overwhelming.  This is especially true for those in the Generation Z age range.  Born from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s, they have grown up with technology their entire lives and don't even know of a world without it. That's why many Gen-Zers are bringing back vintage devices so that they can feel what it's like to truly disconnect too.

Lots of devices, including CD players, Polaroid cameras, and MP3 players, have skyrocketed in sales over the last few years. However, perhaps the most popular device that is growing in popularity is the classic flip phone that most people had back in the '90s and early 2000s before the first iPhone was introduced. We all know how easy it is to be consumed in scrolling on our smartphones as they have everything we could ever want – social media apps, cameras for taking selfies, internet access, endless music playlists, and on and on. Flip phones, on the other hand, only allow people to make and receive calls and send text messages. It’s a no frills, no app experience from the simple days of analog. Some may provide basic games on them, yet for the most part, it's strictly a device for communicating with your friends and family when you need to. TOP BROWSERS TARGETED BY NEW MALWARE TO STEAL YOUR SENSITIVE DATA Record players are among older tech that has become collectible. (CyberGuy.com) Why are these older devices being brought back now? There's truly too much information out there for our minds to consume. Every streaming platform has thousands of movies and TV shows to watch, every news outlet can flood your smartphone with stories 24/7, and the content we scroll through on social media is endless. Having an older device can eliminate the temptation of staying on your phone for hours because there really isn't enough that an older device can offer us that would keep us preoccupied for hours on end. Although the Gen-Zers may be grateful for their devices, they probably wonder what it was like for their parents and grandparents before all this technology was shoved in their faces. It's almost impossible to stay completely disconnected from the world at this point, so this is a great way for Gen-Z people to remain connected to their loved ones while not spending so much of their lives with their faces on their screens.
