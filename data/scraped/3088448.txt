Warm weather means ice cream. But why not take it up a notch with the peach melba at AquaTerra Grille in Pearl River? I did — and it's the best thing I ate this week.

I don't see a lot of peach melbas on menus, which is why this one intrigued me. Did you know the dessert dates to 1892 and was invented by a French chef in London, to honor the Australian soprano Nellie Melba? Apparently Melba toast is also named after her. Who knew? And who knows? If I continue with the foods named after people, I may end up opting for a Caesar salad or Oysters Rockefeller next. Stay tuned to Instagram to see what I choose; my "Best Thing I Ate" posts run every Friday. Jeanne Muchnick covers food and dining.
