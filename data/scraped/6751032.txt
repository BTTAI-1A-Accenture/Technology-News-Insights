The Cincinnati Bengals' tradition of gifting postseason game balls to local bars and restaurants is relatively new but has quickly become loved by fans. It began last year after the Bengals defeated the Las Vegas Raiders in the wild-card round of the playoffs, earning their first postseason win in 31 years. And it continued throughout the run to the Super Bowl. This year, the gesture has returned. “That tradition is never gonna die,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said. “We got a good thing going ... I’m not going to reveal all that right now, but we want to include as many people as possible." Three more local bars received game balls after the Bengals' 24-17 wild-card round win over the Baltimore Ravens on Jan. 15: The Blind Pig, Crowley's Irish Pub and Clutch OTR. So, we decided to put together a list of all the lucky establishments to be honored the last two seasons. Take a look below. NFL:Looking for a place to watch the Bengals during playoffs?

The Bottom Line, a bar and restaurant located just a few hundred feet from the White House, also received one of the six game balls from that win. Fox 19 reports that the Bottom Line is just 45 miles from downtown Baltimore. Phebe's Tavern, a Bengals-friendly bar in New York City's East Village, will also receive an out-of-town game ball, according to a video from the team's website.  Is a local business missing from this list?
