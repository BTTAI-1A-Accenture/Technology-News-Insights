High Schools Club programs have peeled more off the top of the varsity ranks, the Lake Conference is crowded, and Visitation appears up to a challenge. By Ron Haggstrom The pool of outstanding Minnesota girls swimmers is growing. It is causing a ripple effect at the high school level. The state's top-ranked swimmers in the next three classes, as ranked by Swimcloud, are all swimming with a club team this fall instead of their high school program. Two did so last season, Eden Prairie senior Caroline Larsen and Andover junior Grace Rabb. Joining them this season is Andover sophomore Cate Pawlaski. Larsen is the only one committed collegiately, to Louisville. Each swims for a different club, Larsen with the Foxjets, Rabb with the Aquajets and Pawlaski with the Edina Swim Club. All three competed in the Junior National Championships this summer. Pawlaski was the Class 2A defending champion last season in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1 minute, 2.79 seconds. Chanhassen's Avery Luedke, the No. 2-rated swimmer in the Class of 2025, and Minneapolis Washburn's Paige Moreen, No. 5 in the Class of 2024, have also decided to swim with their club teams. Moreen has committed to the Gophers. It's hard to think of defending state champion Edina, winner of the Class 2A team championship eight of the past 12 seasons, as an underdog, but that will be the case in 2023. The Hornets surprised Lake Conference rival Minnetonka by six points to win the state crown last season, and the Skippers are a slight favorite again this season. Schools from the Lake have won the past 12 titles; Wayzata's three and Minnetonka's one account for others. The Trojans finished third a year ago. Visitation has taken home the Class 1A team trophy every year since 2013, nine consecutive seasons; there was no state meet in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Blazers were hit hard by graduation after doubling runner-up Delano's score at state last season. Normally, that would make them vulnerable to the likes of Delano, Mound Westonka/Holy Family, Orono, Blake or Breck. But those five programs are in two sections, which will limit their number of state entrants. Visitation won't have that problem, so look for the Blazers to make it 10 in a row.
