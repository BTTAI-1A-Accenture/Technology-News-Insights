Aired in January, the 39-episode crime drama called “The Knockout” quickly became the most talked-about show online. It has broken several records, such as becoming the most popular show on the streaming platform iQiyi, which reportedly crashed due to the number of users tuning in on the ninth day of its run. “The Knockout” was broadcast in over 65% of Chinese cities and received more than 300 million views in a single day, more than 10 times the number for the second most popular show.
