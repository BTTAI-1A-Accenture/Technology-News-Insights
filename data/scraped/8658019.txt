Tive leads the way as end-to-end, real-time visibility solutions become table stakes for shippers and logistics professionals around the world BOSTON, Jan. 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Tive, the global leader in supply chain and logistics visibility technology, today announced exceptional growth in 2022 as the company continues their quest to provide critical end-to-end supply chain visibility to all global shippersâas well as to their end customers. Tive celebrates the following 2022 milestones and accomplishments: "Tive customers move goods throughout the globeâpowering our economy and our daily lives," says Krenar Komoni, CEO & Founder of Tive. "Tive is focused on demonstrating operating leverage, and providing a simple way for shippers and logistics service providers to monitor their shipmentsâin real timeâand in a collaborative way with all stakeholders involved in moving those goods at the container, pallet, and item level." In April, Tive raised $54M in Series B funding, led by AXA Venture Partners with participation from Sorenson Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, Fifth Wall, SJF Ventures, and Floating Point Ventures  as well as existing investors RRE Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures, NextView Ventures, Hyperplane Ventures, Broom Ventures, and Supply Chain Ventures. This investment is continuing to fuel Tive's rapidly-growing global customer base, accelerating the development and introduction of next-generation solutions, and enabling the company to bring actionable supply chain intelligence and 24/7 monitoring services to the market. In July 2022, the company introduced the revolutionary Tive Tagâthe most cost-effective, easiest-to-use temperature logger available for end-to-end cold chain monitoring of temperature-sensitive shipments. Taking the form of a thin, flexible shipping label, Tive Tag is a cloud-enabled temperature logger that costs less than half the price of a conventional data logger deviceâand can be reused for more than a year. In September of 2022, the company launched a validated, complete cold chain solution for pharmaceutical, biological, and cell gene therapy companiesâincluding cryogenic and dry ice probesâenabling these industries to protect their critical cold chain shipments. Tive Solo 5G trackers (available in both lithium and non-lithium models for all modes of transportation) cover the temperature range of -30 °C to 50 °C, and the cryogenic and dry ice probes extend the lower range to -200 °C. Tive also announced a cold chain offering for the food and beverage industry. This solution provides perishable shippers and LSPs a choice of two targeted methods for reducing waste and assuring product quality: Tive Solo 5G real-time trackers or Tive Tag. Both solutions help users meet the FSMA requirement of storing 12 months of temperature data of perishable products. "The hyper-accurate location and sensor data collected by our trackers provide unparalleled visibility and unique insights for our customers and their shipments. Our company's growth in 2022 is a direct result of our continued innovation and leadershipâand as we continue to expand operations and release new products to the market, our services are becoming table stakes in the industry," continued Komoni. "We at Tive look forward to ushering in this new age of end-to-end supply chain visibilityâacross industries and around the globe." Tive's global workforce expansion continued in 2022, with new offices opening in Norway, Africa, and Mexico. In Q3, the company's U.S. corporate headquarters relocated to a new office in the Hood Park area of Bostonâa move that will fuel even more growth for Tive. Tive expanded their executive team with five critical team members in 2022: Industry recognition was a big story for Tive in 2022 as the company continued to receive accolades from industry thought leaders and insiders: In 2021, Tive co-launched the Open Visibility Network (OVN)âin conjunction with project44 and FourKitesâwith the goal of providing 100% visibility for all shipments. In 2022, OVN membership increased from eight members to 17 and continues to attract a broad range of global technology solution providers in the supply chain, logistics, transportation, and other industry-agnostic markets, including blockchain, data management, enterprise system providers, and established 3PL/4PL leaders. About Tive Tive is a global leader in supply chain and logistics technology. With Tive, shippers, retailers, and Logistics Service Providers (LSPs) have the ability to eliminate delays, avoid damage, and mitigate shipment failures. Tive's solution provides insights generated by its industry-leading products for clients to actively optimize their shipments, improve the customer experience, and unlock actionable data in real time.
