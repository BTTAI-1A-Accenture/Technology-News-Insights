(PRWEB) February 01, 2023   Quantum Fuel Systems (Quantum), a fully integrated alternative energy company, has been selected by Permian Global, Inc. d/b/a CORE Automated Fueling Solutions (CORE), to deliver six of its industry-leading virtual pipeline trailers for natural gas. The trailers will be delivered to CORE, a leading CNG provider in West Texas, in Q3 2023.  With this contract, Quantum will provide CORE with its VPLite45/40 trailers, which have an industry-leading gaseous capacity of approximately 472,000 standard cubic feet and weigh less than 59,000 pounds fully loaded.
