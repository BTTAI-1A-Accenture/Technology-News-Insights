Downing Street said on Thursday the situation was being kept “under review”, although there are currently no plans to introduce measures “at the moment”. Speculation is growing that the UK could follow the US, Italy, Japan and Taiwan in requiring arrivals from China to test for Covid, with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) monitoring the situation. If introduced, it would be the first Covid-related restrictions in the UK for nearly a year, after Boris Johnson’s government removed all of its pandemic-related measures under its “living with Covid” plans. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We are keeping the situation under review and the UKHSA is monitoring the public health situation. At the moment there are no plans to introduce any new Covid-19 testing for arrivals.” Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, told reporters in Manchester that the situation is “as we speak being reviewed”. Former health minister, Lord Bethell, told the Today programme that ministers should “seriously look at” compulsory Covid testing for travellers from China, while Steve Brine, the Tory chairman of the health select committee, told Times Radio that the lesson learned from three years ago, when Covid first emerged in China, was that “time is of the essence”. On Wednesday, the US announced it would require all arrivals from China to test negative for Covid from New Year’s Day, while Italy has said anyone travelling from China who tests positive must go into quarantine. China is to reopen its borders and allow people to travel from 8 January, and lifted its lockdown restrictions earlier this month after a wave of protests against harsh lockdown measures, leading to a spike of Covid cases in the country.
