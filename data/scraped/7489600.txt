Scenic Group is adding Starlink high-speed internet from Elon Musk’s SpaceX venture to its ocean-going ships. The faster, more reliable internet connection was introduced on Scenic Eclipse II prior to its christening in June together with 100-passenger Emerald Azzurra. Starlink is due to be added to Emerald Sakara, which is due to be launched in August, and Scenic Eclipse by the end of 2023. These upgrades will offer guests the ability to easily communicate with their friends and family back home – sharing their holiday experiences through social media, and with photos and videos – almost as they happen. SpaceX’s Starlink made its first foray into the cruise industry in 2022. Its 3,500 satellites provide ships with internet access speeds claimed to be up to 70 times faster than standard satellites and offers more reliable internet service.  The service currently spans many of Scenic’s destinations and  routes from ports in Europe to the most remote regions such as Antarctica.
