PITTSBURGH, Oct. 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- "I'm a truck driver and tired of using traditional heavy cloth cargo straps that tend to tear and break over time," said an inventor, from Lake Charles, La., "so I invented the MYERS STRAP. My dependable design conforms to the shape of the flatbed load while resisting breakage, tearing, and failure." 



 The patent-pending invention provides an improved restraint strap for flatbed truck and trailer loads. In doing so, it offers an alternative to using traditional heavy cloth cargo straps that can tear and break. As a result, it would maintain a solid grip over freight being shipped on flatbeds, and it reduces the risk of the load shifting or breaking. The invention features a durable design that is easy to use so it is ideal for truckers and trucking companies, industrial fields, oil fields, and anyone who transports any type of freight for better securement. The original design was submitted to the National sales office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
