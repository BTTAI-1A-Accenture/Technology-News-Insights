 Microsoft has released emergency out-of-band (OOB) updates to fix Kerberos authentication issues that were affecting a large proportion of enterprise users. The tech giant released the updates on 17 and 18 November for all domain controllers (DCs) in affected environments. Microsoft aimed to fix an issue which could cause sign-in failures in Kerberos, Microsoft's longstanding default authentication protocol. System administrators' complaints began last week when many reported various processes breaking within their organisation. Faults in Kerberos can lead to issues relating to user sign-ins, Internet Information Services (IIS Web Server), remote desktop connections, and accessing shared folders, among others.

Alternatively, the updates can be imported manually into Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for those organisations that use the tools to manage their IT estate. There are cumulative updates available: Users don’t need to apply any previous updates before installing these ones. Microsoft said that users don’t have to uninstall the affected updates before installing any later updates either. Receive our latest news, industry updates, featured resources and more.

There are also standalone updates available: Users that are deploying security-only updates for these Windows Server versions only have to install the standalone updates for November 2022. They will also need to install previous security updates to be fully up-to-date since these aren’t cumulative. Microsoft was forced to introduce an emergency update to fix a number of updates it implemented on 8 November. The tech giant said that users could encounter a number of issues with Kerberos authentication. This could affect domain user sign-in, group managed service accounts (gMSA), and remote desktop connections.

When encountering the issue, Microsoft said that admins might receive a Microsoft-Windows-Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center Event ID 14 error event in the event log system section on a DC, displaying the text: 'While processing an AS request for target service {service}, the account {account name} did not have a suitable key for generating a Kerberos ticket (the missing key has an ID of 1). The requested etypes : 18 3. The accounts available etypes : 23 18 17. Changing or resetting the password of {account name} will generate a proper key'. The tech giant said that the issue isn’t part of a security hardening for Netlogon and Kerberos which began with the November security update. Devices used at home by consumers, or those that aren’t linked to an on-premise domain, won’t be affected by the problem.
