Philippine internet speeds saw mixed movements in the first month of 2023, according to the latest figures released by global speed monitoring firm Speedtest by Ookla. The latest Ookla Speedtest Global Index report showed the country’s fixed broadband median download speed level improved to 88.13 megabits per second (Mbps) from the 87.13 Mbps registered the month before. This is a 1.14% month-on-month improvement for fixed broadband internet speed. It also represents an improvement of 26.39% since the Marcos administration began in July 2022. Meanwhile, mobile median download speed slightly dipped as the country yielded a download speed of 24.59 Mbps from 25.12 Mbps the month before. This represents a decline of 2.1% month-on-month for mobile internet speed. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the Marcos administration, mobile internet speed has seen an improvement of 9.05%. “The NTC shall constantly work for the steady improvement of internet speed as part of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.’s thrust to advance the country’s digital connectivity,” National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) Commissioner Ella Blanca Lopez said in a statement. “We look forward to Starlink’s commercial availability this year to further improve internet speeds in the country,” she added. Data Lake, a data company led by tycoon Henry Sy Jr., is expediting the entry of Starlink to the Philippines within the first three months of 2023.  — VBL, GMA Integrated News
