Party City plans to close over 30 stores in the US following its bankruptcy filing in January.  The party-supplies retailer said it planned to close 22 stores in February, according to documents filed in bankruptcy court in February. In April, the retailer announced that it would close another nine stores in California, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Michigan. Four more stores – in California, Texas, and Massachusetts – have now joined the list, A&G Real Estate Partners, the real-estate advisor auctioning the stores, announced Tuesday. Party City had already closed and vacated 28 stores in 13 states prior to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on January 18, and it is now asking the court to release it from those leases, Retail Dive reported. The chain operated 823 retail locations, 770 of which were company-owned, according to court documents filed in January. The retailer has struggled since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Sales lagged during lockdowns, and supply-chain disruptions in the years since have hampered inventory levels and helium has been in short supply, Reuters reported. Correction: February 20, 2023 — An earlier version of this story misidentified the state home to one of the announced Party City closings. Party City said it would auction off 12 stores in six states, not seven, including a location at 1510 N West Ave. in Jackson, Michigan, not Jackson, Mississippi.
