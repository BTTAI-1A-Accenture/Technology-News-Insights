EAST TEXAS (KLTV) - Several East Texas water systems have rescinded boil notices that were issued following last weekâ€™s hard freeze. In each case, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality required the public water system to issue a boil water notice to inform customers that due to conditions which occurred recently, the water from this public water system was required to be boiled prior to use for drinking water or human consumption purposes. Now, each public water system listed has taken the necessary corrective actions to restore the quality of the water distributed for drinking water or human consumption purposes and has provided TCEQ with laboratory test results that indicate that the water no longer requires boiling prior to use.
