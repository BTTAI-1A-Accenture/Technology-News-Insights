These orbiting space debris threaten about 3,000 functioning satellites presently in orbit, used for modern critical communication and other purposes. Any damage, even minor, to such space assets can have cascading impacts on many vital systems, including communication, transportation, time scheduling, and critical defense-related aspects. Many state-of-the-art defense technologies such as guided missiles, drones, intelligence data collections, encrypted communications, and navigation would be limited or can become inoperable with defunct satellite systems. It is thus crucial to analyze the comparative approach of all space objects to detect collision threats well in advance. SSA deals with the thorough knowledge of the space environment, assessment of any threats to space activities, and implementing necessary mitigation measures to safeguard the functional space assets. It consequently plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and sustainable space activities complying with domestic and international guidelines, standards, and other norms. Owing to the critical functionality of SSA and the rising importance of satellites, the space situational awareness (SSA) market is positively impacted by the increasing amount of space debris. Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Market: COVID-19 OverviewThe US, Japan, India, France, Russia, and the UK were among the worst-affected countries by COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 outbreak disrupted various industries such as automotive, manufacturing, energy & power, aerospace & defense, and construction in 2020. The imposition of containment measures such as trade bans, travel restrictions, and workforce limitations at workplaces adversely impacted the manufacturing, supply, and sales of various businesses. Such disruptions promoted internet usage, telecommunication modes, and digital transformation adoption across the world. All these factors increased the involvement of satellites. However, a shortage of key semiconductor components delayed the launches of several satellites. Additionally, liquid oxygen was diverted to various hospitals to treat patients. Thus, the space industry reported disruptions in space manufacturing, rocket launches, and satellite operations during the pandemic. Such challenges also led to a decrease in the adoption of SSA in the first half of 2020. However, increased internet usage and high digital transformation of various industries strongly promoted satellite usage. This has led to a negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the space situational awareness (SSA) market growth.  Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Market: Offering OverviewBased on offering, the space situational awareness (SSA) market is segmented into software and services. According to the space situational awareness (SSA) market analysis, the services segment accounted for a larger space situational awareness (SSA) market share in 2022 and is expected to retain it is dominance during the forecast period as well. Also, the services segment is expected to witness highest CAGR during the forecast period in the global space situational awareness (SSA) market.
