A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection between your device and another network over the internet. VPNs are useful for protecting your online privacy, accessing geo-restricted content, or bypassing censorship. In this article, you will learn how to set up a VPN on your computer hardware using two methods: using a VPN service or creating your own VPN server.
 
The easiest way to set up a VPN is to use a VPN service provider that offers software or apps for your computer hardware. There are many VPN services available, both free and paid, that support different operating systems, devices, and features. To use a VPN service, you need to sign up for an account, download and install the software or app, and follow the instructions to connect to a VPN server of your choice. Some VPN services also allow you to adjust the settings, such as the encryption protocol, the kill switch, or the split tunneling.

            Setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows you to establish a secure and encrypted connection between your device and a remote server or network. This can be useful for privacy, security, and accessing resources on a private network from a remote location. Here's a general outline of how to set up a VPN:

1. Choose a VPN Protocol and Service:

Select the VPN protocol you want to use (e.g., OpenVPN, L2TP, PPTP, or IPsec).
Choose a VPN service provider. There are many paid and free options available, each with its own features and server locations.
2. Sign Up and Download Software:
3. Install the VPN Client
4. Launch the VPN Client
5. Connect to a VPN Server

            Manual Configuration
Step 1:
Configure a VPN server.
On a virtual machine or dedicated server, you can set up your own VPN server.

Step 2:
Specify the VPN protocol to be used (PPTP, L2TP/IPsec, OpenVPN, etc.).

Step 3: Set Up the Device or Router
Either manually configure the VPN connection on each device or configure your router to accept VPN connections.

Step 4: Examine the Link
To ensure the VPN is functioning properly, visit a website to see your IP address.

            There are different types of VPN from Ipsec tunnels to remote access VPNs using a client application, for the tunnel VPN u need to know if is site to site VPN, point to Site, point to Point VPN, then you decide on the encryption type,encryption profile and preshared key with appropriate network addresses   Setting up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) typically involves these general steps:

1. Choose a VPN provider: Select a reliable VPN service that suits your needs, considering factors like security, speed, and server locations.

2. Subscribe and create an account: Sign up for a plan that works for you, and create an account on the VPN provider's website.

3. Download and install the VPN application: After subscribing, download the VPN app from the provider's website or an app store.

4. Launch the application and sign in: Open the VPN app and log in using the account credentials you created.

5. Connect to a server: Choose a server location from the available options in the VPN app. Often, it's as simple as clicking a button to connect. 
Another way to set up a VPN is to create your own VPN server on your computer hardware. This method gives you more control and customization over your VPN, but it also requires more technical skills and resources. To create your own VPN server, you need to have a dedicated computer hardware that can run a VPN software, such as OpenVPN, WireGuard, or SoftEther. You also need to have a public IP address or a domain name, and configure your firewall and router to allow VPN traffic. Then, you need to install and configure the VPN software on your server and your client devices, and generate the necessary certificates and keys.

            On my experience setting up a VPN involves choosing a service or hosting your own server. Install the client software or configure the server with the preferred protocol. Open the client, enter server details, and connect securely. Ensure proper port forwarding if needed. Test the VPN to verify functionality.

            VPN servers can be setup in many forms. There are physical and virtual appliances that help accomplish accessing resources remotely, and secure.

Most times the VPN server for enterprises will be running from a physical firewall device or virtual network appliance in the cloud. Configuration of these servers are much alike following the H-A-G-L-E rule of establishing a VPN connection.

The primary components that a VPN need to function are DNS, networking, default route, remote client settings on both sides.

Upon connecting the following need to match on both sides hash (SHA-1), authentication (cert or username and password), DH group, DH key lifetime, and encryption protocol (AES-256).

Configure your service device and connect with PC. 
Using a VPN can be a great way to protect your computer hardware and online activities. It can enhance your security and privacy by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address from hackers, ISPs, or third parties. Additionally, a VPN can help you access geo-restricted or censored content by connecting to a server in a different country or region. It can also bypass network throttling or blocking by disguising your traffic as regular HTTPS traffic. Furthermore, you may be able to save money on online shopping or travel by finding better deals or prices in different markets. Lastly, it can improve your gaming experience by reducing latency, avoiding DDoS attacks, or joining multiplayer servers in other regions.

            VPNs can server many purposes with the consumer side more focused on identity privacy and the enterprise focused on secure, remote connections to resources.

When using a VPN to connect to secure remote resources from your company an IPSec VPN is created by the client and forms a secure encrypted connection to your company. From here you can access resources just as you would sitting in your office or datacenter.

When using a VPN on the consumer side, most people opt for a VPN service. The VPN service you choose in this case is not as secure as the person who controls the last hop in a connection owns the data. Only pick a VPN service you trust and utilize the service like you would be fine with the other side seeing all your activity. 
Using a VPN can have some risks that you should be aware of and mitigate. Your internet speed or performance may slow down due to the extra encryption and routing overhead. Additionally, your data or identity could be exposed if the VPN service or server is compromised, has weak security, or logs your activity. Furthermore, some websites or services may not work properly if they detect and block VPN traffic, such as Netflix, Hulu, or banking sites. Moreover, the use of VPNs may be prohibited or restricted in certain countries or regions, such as China, Russia, or Iran.

            VPN’s are often a great way for companies to connect employees and resources that are not physically together at any given point in time. 

VPN’s also can serve as a single point of failure for many organizations. If you have >50% of your employee base remote/offsite and your VPN experiences a service outage, there is often no backup in place. 

Third party VPN’s also provide risk to companies as the VPN service provider can be affected by zero day attacks or can be exploited and used as a back door into your organization. Using weak PSK’s or other singular methods of authentication also provide risk for companies when using VPN’s. 
To get the most out of your VPN and avoid potential problems, it's important to follow some best practices. Start by choosing a reputable and reliable VPN service or server that meets your needs and preferences, and read the terms and conditions carefully. Use a strong and unique password for your VPN account or server, and make sure to change it regularly. Enable the kill switch feature on your VPN software or app, which will automatically disconnect your internet connection if the VPN drops. Test your VPN connection for leaks, such as DNS, WebRTC, or IPv6 leaks with online tools or websites. Lastly, disconnect your VPN when you don't need it, and use different VPN servers for different purposes.

            I signed up for Surfshark VPN to secure my public WiFi browsing. Downloaded the browser extension on my laptop and logged into my account. When connecting to public networks, I launch the VPN extension and connect to a server in the United States to mask my true IP. It shows I'm connected with a US IP address, letting me browse privately. I disconnect from the VPN when on my home WiFi to restore my original IP. Now I always use the Surfshark VPN browser extension to keep my data secure on public networks by routing through a US server.
