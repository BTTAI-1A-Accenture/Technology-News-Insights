 When you join with the promo code ‘CBS1000’ and opt-in for the bonus, you’ll get up to $1,000 as a bonus bet back if your first bet loses. For example, say you place a $500 first wager on your home team to win their next game. If they lose, you will receive $500 back in bonus bets, which you can use on futures wagers. A bet of more than $1,000 is fine, but if it loses, you’ll only receive a maximum of $1,000 as a bonus. This bonus is particularly good because it offers one of the highest dollar amounts of any sports betting bonus in the U.S.  Note that the Caesars bonus only applies to your first bet. The bonus bet will expire after 14 days, and if your bet is a winner, you’ll only receive the winnings, not the initial stake. Caesars is a prime destination for sportsbook promotions. There are dozens available at any given time. Here are a few of the best types of Caesars promo offers you can claim:  One of the perks of placing your bets at Caesars Sportsbook is the occasional chance at winning a massive prize, like a luxury getaway. The terms and conditions vary, as do the prizes offered. Recently, Caesars Sportsbook offered an NHL Flyaway experience to three lucky bettors who won a giveaway. To qualify, bettors had to opt in and place $50 or more on bets with minimum odds of -200.  The prizes offered are regularly switched, so check back often to see if there’s a luxury experience giveaway that you’re interested in.  For special events such as the NFL postseason, Caesars Sportsbook runs giveaways that grant users reward credits for the Caesars Rewards program. Look for massive prizes in these promos and read the conditions, as they can change depending on the event.  Profit boosts are common in most sportsbooks, but Caesars has one of the best selections of any platform. Standard, sport-specific boosts are offered frequently, such as a 33% boost on an NBA game. Selecting “Boosts” from the homepage of Caesars Sportsbook will bring you to (usually) dozens of specific boosts on upcoming matches. Pursue them to see if your preferred bet has a boost.   The Caesars Sportsbook referral bonus grants you and the friend you refer 5,000 Reward Credits each. It’s a unique referral bonus in that it doesn’t directly give you bonus bets like other sportsbooks. The Caesars Rewards program is excellent, though, so you might want to consider claiming the bonus if you plan to redeem perks. For a company that offers some of the nation’s best hotels and casinos, one might expect Caesars Sportsbook to offer an outstanding user experience. Fortunately, Caesars delivers on these expectations, and even exceeds them. Here’s why: The Caesars user experience on desktop and mobile is polished. From the second you download the app, you are in good hands. The buttons and menu items are clear and intuitive. It only takes a few seconds to place a bet.  The Caesars app has one of the best designs of any sportsbook. The color scheme is a dark green laid over white with a muted gold accent color. The result is a product that is simultaneously easy to look at and simple to understand. The user interface does a great job of guiding users through every action by highlighting popular options and displaying everything you need. For example, the “Place Bet” action requires you to swipe up, which is a satisfying way to lock in a wager.

 Caesars Sportsbook makes signing up a breeze. To get started, follow these steps: Once you’ve done all that, you’re set to start betting. Be sure to keep the first bet bonus in mind when you place your initial wager.  The Caesars Sportsbook app is everything you look for in a mobile sportsbook: speedy, responsive and easy on the eyes. The core user interface is incredibly sleek, with only three primary menu options on the bottom: Home, My Promos and Bets. The account button at the top of the app home screen (represented by either your initials or a profile photo) seamlessly brings up a menu that allows you to withdraw, deposit, check your rewards balance, refer friends or access your preferences. As for the betting itself? It’s very smooth at Caesars Sportsbook. The app is highly responsive and updates quickly to reflect odds changes for live betting. We didn’t find a hitch in the Caesars Sportsbook app. Caesars offers a simple sports betting experience, in a good way. While it doesn’t have some of the same bells and whistles as its competitors, there are still plenty of features worth noting.  When a game or match is live, Caesars offers clean and simplified views of the score and progress via scoreboard and game tracker widgets. Click on them for a live match, and you’ll get an at-a-glance view of all the key information. While live streams in place of these tools would be nice, they’re still good resources.  Caesars is an excellent sportsbook for live betting. It quickly updates odds for in-progress matchups, and offers a dedicated “Live” page where you can sift through the sports that have active games. Caesars Sportsbook comes highly recommended for fans of live betting.  Caesars Sportsbook’s boosts have been mentioned a few times, but they’re worth bringing up once more. Click the “Boosts” icon in the top menu to see all sorts of amazing profit boosts and special offers for specific bets. These are a great way to maximize your potential winnings, especially if your desired bet is listed.  Caesars has a wealth of banking options for sports bettors. Deposits will almost always hit your account instantly, while withdrawals can take longer to process. Here’s a quick look at the main payment methods offered by Caesars Sportsbook. They may vary for you depending on state regulations.  Caesars offers some of the fastest withdrawals of any sportsbook, with some methods that take less than an hour.  You may also be able to deposit or withdraw at a Caesars property (or approved partner) in your state if there’s a participating location.  Once you’re ready to make a deposit or withdrawal from Caesars, you should keep a few terms and conditions in mind.  PayPal is one of the fastest, most secure and most trusted payment platforms out there. It is highly recommended for sports bettors at Caesars or elsewhere. However, keep in mind that any money you deposit with PayPal can only be withdrawn via PayPal.  The minimum deposit for most methods at Caesars Sportsbook is $10. Some sportsbooks have better minimums, but this one isn’t all that bad. Meanwhile, Caesars has a daily maximum transaction limit of $500.  Caesars Sportsbook doesn’t charge any fees for deposits or withdrawals. However, your provider or banking institution might. It is worthwhile to check with them to ensure you won’t be slapped with surprise fees.

 Many first-time sports bettors like to know whether their sportsbook of choice is better than another platform. One measure to compare sportsbooks is the availability of different types of bets. Here’s a preview of Caesars Sportsbook’s markets. Caesars has a lot of sports betting coverage, but ideally there would be more depth to the markets available. Many sports only have a select few betting markets compared to the competition.  Also, note that the bet types above are only a smattering of what Caesars offers, and other bets might be available for your favorite sports. For more about betting markets, see our sports betting guide explainers.  Caesars Sportsbook offers three primary channels for customer assistance: Of all the sportsbooks we reviewed, Caesars had the top live chat support. Representatives are kind, fast, and helpful. Whenever an answer to a question could not be found via the help center, the live chat provided quick responses. The email channel is helpful as well, though response times can reach up to 48 hours.  There are a few key points in Caesars’ favor when comparing it to betting with FanDuel Sportsbook. Naturally, FanDuel gets credit where its due as well.  Caesars Sportsbook’s welcome bonus offers up to $1,000 back as a bonus bet if your first bet loses. If your bet wins, you still come out on top and get the profits even though the bonus expires. FanDuel offers $200 in bonus bets if you wager of $5 or more. FanDuel also currently offers new users three weeks of access to NFL Sunday Ticket. Both Caesars and FanDuel have a wealth of bonuses offered regularly to existing users. Caesars Rewards has one of the best loyalty programs in the industry. You can redeem your Caesars rewards for bets, hotel stays, shopping, restaurants and more. FanDuel’s rewards program? It doesn’t exist. FanDuel only has a rewards program for DFS players. Rewards programs can be considered under the “user experience” umbrella, so Caesars gets a nice boost in this category.  However, we did find FanDuel to have a great user experience overall, even in the absence of a rewards program. FanDuel’s layout, aesthetics and navigation made placing a bet easier and more enjoyable than on pretty much any other sportsbook. FanDuel has a better variety of betting markets on any given game, and it covers more sports than Caesars does. While the odds are often comparable, the sheer variety makes FanDuel a winner in this category.  FanDuel wins here, as well. We foudn the functionality to be the best in the industry. FanDuel’s app was quicker and smoother than any other app we looked at, and even Caesars Sportsbook’s streamlined app experience can’t beat it.  While Caesars trounces FanDuel in some categories, the latter still has a lot going for it, including a better mobile app and a superior same game parlay selection. FanDuel also covers more sports markets than Caesars. It really comes down to personal preference with both sportsbooks scoring incredibly well in our reviews. After covering all of the specifics, here is how we see Caesars Sportsbook with from a macro perspective  Caesars Rewards is one of the best aspects of Caesars Sportsbook. If you plan to bet with any sort of regularity, consider Caesars Sportsbook for the rewards alone. You can even refer friends and get 5,000 Reward Credits if they sign up.  The Caesars Rewards program offers special promos, bonus bets and access to exclusive perks and discounts.  This is a complicated question, but the bottom line is that it just might be. The reality of sports betting is that there are many apps, and they all have something their competitors don’t. Caesars Sportsbook stands out for its excellent rewards program and giveaways. Competing sportsbooks can’t quite match Caesars’ offering. On the other hand, Caesars Sportsbook’s competitors can beat it out in other areas like betting markets offered or faster payouts.  Still, Caesars should be among your library of sports betting sites, as it is the best sportsbook out there.  Caesars Sportsbook likes to call its users “emperors,” and there’s some truth to it. Playing at Caesars makes you feel like you’re royalty. It earns a 4.9 out of 5 from us.  The standouts at Caesars Sportsbook are its profit boosts (dozens per day) and amazing mobile app. Its frequent giveaways and highly competitive odds offerings are also commendable.  While certain aspects of Caesars Sportsbook could improve, such as the market depth, it is still strongly recommended to any sports bettor. It is exceedingly difficult to declare one sportsbook to be the best over the others. However, we feels certain that Caesars deserves a seat at the table.
