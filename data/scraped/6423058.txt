Reasons to Purchase: Smart street lighting refers to streetlights equipped with technologies such as cameras, light-sensing photocells, and other sensors. They are used for general illumination and enable monitoring of various parameters such as traffic, parking, pedestrian crossings, seismic activity, and atmospheric changes. The main types of smart street lighting include light emitting diode (LED), compact fluorescent lamps, incandescent, and others. LED is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current flows through it. The various communication technologies used in smart street lighting include NB-IOT, powerline communication, radio frequency, and others. These lighting systems utilize traditional and renewable energy sources, including solar energy. They find applications in environmental monitoring, traffic optimization, smart parking, and other areas, catering to commercial, residential, and industrial end users. Product innovations are a prominent trend in the smart street lighting market, with major companies focusing on developing innovative solutions to strengthen their market position. For instance, LEDVANCE introduced OSRAM NAV LED, a street lighting lamp that offers reduced running costs compared to conventional high-pressure sodium vapor lamps. The OSRAM NAV LED consumes approximately 52% less energy and provides a lifetime of up to 50,000 hours, resulting in lower maintenance costs. It is compatible with conventional control gear and offers high efficiency and additional dimming capabilities. In February 2022, GE Current, a Daintree company, acquired Hubbell Incorporated, a manufacturer of smart street lighting, to enhance its distribution capabilities and offer lighting and control solutions with advanced digital technologies. North America emerged as the largest region in the smart street lighting market in 2022.

Intelligent lighting installations in smart cities contribute to increased citizen satisfaction, improved security and safety, energy savings, and optimized lighting system maintenance. For example, Saudi Arabia is currently building a smart city called "Neom" to host the Asian Winter Games 2029. Neom is designed to incorporate smart city technologies and serve as a tourism destination, with a total estimated cost of $500 billion. The construction of Neom highlights the growing trend of emerging smart cities and their impact on the smart street lighting market. The smart street lighting market includes sales of wired street lighting and wireless street lights. Market values represent the 'factory gate' values of goods sold by manufacturers, including related services. Key Topics Covered: 1. Executive Summary2. Smart Street Lighting Market Characteristics3.
