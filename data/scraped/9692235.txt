 Hello from the Cainiao team. This month, we announced our Q3FY23 earnings, which saw a 27% YoY growth to US$2.4 billion after inter-segment elimination. Growth can be attributed to our continued commitment towards the expanding and strengthening of our global smart logistics network, spanning international express, warehousing and supply chain, last mile logistics and other core capabilities. As part of our plans to expand into key markets, we have joined forces with DHL eCommerce Solutions, the eCommerce logistics specialist of DHL Group, to build Poland’s largest OOH network. The first phase of the agreement will see an investment of €60 million from both Cainiao and DHL to consolidate 1,200 existing locker networks and expand the smart locker chain across Poland. In Vietnam, we welcomed VSICO Shipping Joint Stock Company (“Vsico Shipping”) as a newly-added anchor tenant at our premium warehouse facility strategically located in Long An. In addition to world-class logistics facilities and lowered costs of product distribution, Vsico Shipping and their clients can expect to further expand warehouse space and logistics volume in the near future. Aside from driving digital transformation within the industry, we remain deeply committed to upholding our community service model to uplift communities. Following the devastation that occurred in Turkey, we teamed up with Trendyol to help deliver earthquake-relief supplies to affected regions, with the first batch of relief supplies delivered on 12 February.  In the quarter ended December 31, 2022, revenue from Cainiao, before inter-segment elimination, grew 17% year-over-year to RMB23,023 million (US$3,338 million). Revenue from Cainiao, after inter-segment elimination, grew 27% year-over-year to RMB16,553 million (US$2,400 million), primarily contributed by the increase in revenue from domestic consumer logistics services as a result of service model upgrade since late 2021 to enhance customer experience, and international fulfilment solution services. To improve the quality and speed of Poland’s out-of-home delivery (OOH), Cainiao signed an agreement with DHL eCommerce Solutions, the eCommerce logistics specialist of Deutsche Post DHL Group.  The initial phase of the partnership will see a combined investment of 60 million euros from Cainiao and DHL to consolidate the existing 1,200-strong locker networks and install modern parcel lockers with user-friendly interfaces across key locations in Poland – in a bid to form one of the country’s largest access point networks. Following the onboarding of OOCL Logistics as an anchor tenant earlier this year, Cainiao P.A.T. Logistics Park welcomed its newest anchor tenant, VSICO Shipping Joint Stock Company (“Vsico Shipping”), further reinforcing Cainiao’s strong commitment to supporting businesses’ warehousing diversification strategy. With this, Vsico Shipping and their prestigious Japanese motorbike corporation client will benefit from world-class logistics facilities including 30,000 square meters of premium warehouse space as well as technical support and other services. Following two earthquakes that striked Turkey earlier in February, Trendyol Group launched a solidarity campaign on its platform to call for international donations as part of relief efforts. Cainiao teamed up with Trendyol to help deliver donated supplies to affected regions in Turkey. The first batch of relief supplies, including 10,000 winter coats and 550 sleeping bags, were successfully delivered on 12 February. Following which, Cainiao also transported the second batch of relief materials consisting of children’s down jackets, sleeping bags, and more, to Turkey’s earthquake-stricken areas.
