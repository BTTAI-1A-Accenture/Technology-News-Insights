The Intelligent JetBridge Safety Shoe (iJSS) is used to protect open aircraft doors from contact with the floor of the jet bridge/PBB (passenger boarding bridge) or other servicing equipment. It performs a safety backup to the auto-leveler function.  The iJSS can be used on any older or newer jet bridge, though the unique "intelligent" feature is its monitoring aircraft door contact and provide alert to key personnel via SMS/text message. It also logs status of iJSS actions. The Safety Shoe sensor is placed under the open aircraft door. The “Black-Box” electronics consistently monitors the sensor and cable and provides the jet bridge/PBB-down function upon aircraft door contact, which can occur due to auto-leveler failure or a timeout from excess up/down motion of the aircraft. An alarm is sounded on any activation of the Safety Shoe sensor. This alerts the operator of door contact and activation of jet bridge/PBB-down function.   By clicking above, I acknowledge and agree to Endeavor Business Media’s Terms of Service and to Endeavor Business Media's use of my contact information to communicate with me about offerings by Endeavor, its brands, affiliates and/or third-party partners, consistent with Endeavor's Privacy Policy.
