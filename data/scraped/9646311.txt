INDIANAPOLIS — While still below average, temperatures still start to moderate today, with highs in the low 60s under a mostly sunny sky.  It'll be a breezy day as well, with westerly wind gusts up to 20 mph.  Bundle up if your plans take you downtown to Gainbridge Fieldhouse for night two of The Eagles. Temperatures will fall into the 40s by the end of the show.  Skies stay clear overnight tonight as temperatures will once again drop into the upper 30s. After a clear and chilly start, more seasonal temperatures return tomorrow as a warm front lifts through the state. This will bring scattered rain showers starting in the late morning but push out of central Indiana into the northern tier of the state by the evening, where rain showers will be likely through Thursday morning.  Temperatures recover into the upper 60s around the metro and into the mid-70s to areas south once the rain ends.  Rain chances stay at bay north of the area again on Thursday as we sit in the warm sector of this weather system, allowing temperatures to recover into the upper 70s. Temperatures will once again climb above average into the upper 70s Friday afternoon before a cold front arrives late in the day. This will bring widespread rain, rumbles of thunder and gusty winds.  We'll see a major temperature drop behind the front for the weekend, with highs back in the mid-50s.  Winds stay gusty, ushering in cool, Canadian air and with spotty showers still possible.
