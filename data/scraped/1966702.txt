Android Headlines / Tech News / VR News / ByteDance's PICO to battle Meta for dominance in the VR industry Meta dominates the XR headset industry, but they are getting serious competition from PICO, a ByteDance-owned company. This VR headset company has made some impressive advancements in recent years. These advancements show that they are preparing themselves for fierce competition with Meta in the VR industry. In recent months, PICO has grown in popularity for a few reasons. The company is also getting more recognition in the VR headset industry. PICO has become ByteDance’s tool to help them secure a solid place in the industry Meta once dominated. Already, the Chinese company has found itself a sweet spot in the VR headset industry. They are now a top competitor in an industry where Meta reigns supreme. PICO came into existence back in 2015 and was then purchased by ByteDance in 2021. After the purchase, PICO started gaining more international recognition and moved to launch a groundbreaking VR headset. The PICO 4 VR headsets were unlike anything the company had previously launched. It came with a new design that is lighter and more stylish than the company’s previous generation VR headset. The specifications and features of this headset took the VR community by surprise. Ever since their launch, the PICO 4 VR headsets have come to be great sellers in Asia and Europe where they retail. This VR headset is a worthy competitor for the Meta Quest Pro since it offers great features. But the PICO 4 VR outshine the Quest Pro by being more affordable whilst offering similar specifications. The Meta Quest Pro does offer better memory and also features an upgraded Qualcomm XR2+ processor. The PICO 4 VR headset on its part comes with the Qualcomm XR2 processor but still retails for more than half of the Quest Pro’s price. Their affordability is making them a top choice for those wanting to experience the world of VR. This has raised the ByteDance-owned company to second place in the VR global market. Both Meta and ByteDance’s PICO continue to invest heavily in their product to help them get better. PICO also went through some rebranding last year before the launch of its most recent VR headset. The tussle for dominance between Meta and PICO in the VR industry will help foster development on both sides in the coming years. Copyright ©2023 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
