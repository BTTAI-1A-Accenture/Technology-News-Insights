HiveMQ launched  Nov. 29 its Enterprise Extension for Amazon Kinesis,  which lets users quickly move MQTT data from the broker into Amazon Web  Services (AWS) using its Kinesis Data Streams. This lets HiveMQ users integrate  MQTT data reliably and securely to any of the three major cloud providers,  including AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, or simultaneously in a  multi-cloud environment. “Our goal is to give customers a  flexible and open foundation for MQTT data transport, no matter which cloud  platform they choose, and this new extension completes that offering,” says Christian  Götz, CEO and co-founder of HiveMQ. “We’re seeing more enterprise customers  adopting multi-cloud strategies, and HiveMQ is perfectly positioned to allow  them to avoid vendor lock-in and integrate data to any of these services for  advanced analytics, machine learning, storage or other use cases.” HiveMQ reports its platform-agnostic  broker offers 100% MQTT compliance, efficient network utilization,  enterprise-grade security, reliable data delivery and the ability to scale to  millions of always-on concurrent connections to meet the requirements of IoT  applications. The extension framework let users integrate seamlessly with  enterprise systems to support multi-cloud strategies and eliminate vendor  lock-in.
