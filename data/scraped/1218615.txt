     "Yellowstone" actor Gil Birmingham talks working with all-star cast at 2023 Critics Choice Awards. Paramount Network is addressing reports that popular family drama "Yellowstone," starring Kevin Costner, may come to end.  Costner recently won the Golden Globe for best actor for his role as John Dutton on the series, but he was reportedly involved in scheduling conflicts prior to the mid-season finale in January. Sources told Deadline that Costner had scheduling limitations. He's currently also directing and starring in the western flick "Horizon." "We have no news to report. Kevin Costner is a big part of ‘Yellowstone,’ and we hope that's the case for a long time to come," a Paramount Network spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
