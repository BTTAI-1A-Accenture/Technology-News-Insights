Upcoming movie “Revolver” (literal title) has begun filming! “Revolver” is a new film about a former police officer named Ha Soo Young who goes to prison after being framed for a crime. After she is released, she lives her life with only one goal in mind. Notably, “Revolver” will mark the reunion of Jeon Do Yeon and director Oh Seung Wook, who previously worked together on the film “The Shameless.” Jeon Do Yeon will be starring as Ha Soo Young, who sets out on a quest for the truth after leaving prison. Ji Chang Wook will be playing the role of Andy, a character who “adds tension” to Ha Soo Young’s journey as she chases after the truth. According to the film’s producers, the character will showcase a different side of Ji Chang Wook from his usual gentle image. Finally, Lim Ji Yeon will be playing Jung Yoon Sun, a woman who teams up with Ha Soo Young for the sake of her own goals.  In newly released stills from the film’s first table read, Jeon Do Yeon wears a chilling smirk as she transforms into the hardened Ha Soo Young.  Lim Ji Yeon also has a fiery glint in her eye as she disappears into the role of Jung Yoon Sun, while Ji Chang Wook fixes a cool gaze on Jeon Do Yeon as he reads Andy’s lines.
