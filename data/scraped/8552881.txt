Xbox Game Pass is arguably the premier gaming service available on the market today, and though it largely caters to an adult audience, there are quite a few titles available in its vast library that are appealing to a younger audience. In fact, there's a pretty vast selection of titles that kids of all ages are sure to find hours of enjoyment in.
                         From brain-teasing puzzle-platformers to creatively stimulating sandbox titles, the best children's games on Xbox Game Pass cover a wide spectrum of genres and gameplay styles. There should be something for just about everyone. Quite a few of the following titles feature cooperative play in one capacity or another, allowing parents and siblings to dive into the fun too.
      Updated August 11, 2024 by Mark Sammut: July 2024 produced one Game Pass game that is particularly suitable for children, and it is an action RPG. That genre is quite rare when it comes to children's games.
                     The rankings are not based solely on quality. For instance, new additions are placed at the top for their first few weeks on Game Pass.
                          Most action RPGs are not particularly great picks for kids since they tend to tackle fairly mature subjects or are slightly too hard for younger players. However, exceptions exist, and Dungeons of Hinterberg is a pretty great 2024 example. The premise is simple: Luisa needs a break from work, so she heads to the Alps to take on the 20+ dungeons. When not hack and slashing her way through enemies, Luisa can be found relaxing at her hotel or simply exploring the beautiful biomes.
                         While hardly shallow, Dungeons of Hinterberg's mechanics are straightforward, especially the combat. The same can be said for its structure, as the game allows players to mostly do their own thing and decide how they want to spend their days. With great visuals, fun exploration, enjoyable combat, and an addictive gameplay loop, this release is a great option for slightly older children.
       Super Smash Bros. is such a pillar of the casual fighting industry that any similar project is immediately fighting an uphill battle to justify its existence, let alone challenge Nintendo's behemoth. Despite the crossover franchise being exclusive to another ecosystem, leaving room for companies to cater to Xbox users without having to directly compete against SSB, platform fighter games have generally struggled to take full advantage of that vacancy.
      Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl was not, frankly, one of the strongest entries in this peculiar subgenre, with the 2021 release lacking polish, replayvalue, or pageantry. It seemed destined to be forgotten. However, the unthinkable happened – Fairy Play released a sequel. And, even more unexpectedly, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 improved considerably on its predecessor. While not fundamentally playing that differently from the first entry, the sequel balanced its character roster while adding flourishes that are not only fun to pull off in the middle of battles but also pay tribute to the source material. Along with multiplayer modes, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is also a viable single-player option thanks to a campaign with a silly but enjoyable story. While quite short and repetitive, the mode is perfect for something like Game Pass.
     Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 features over 20 unique fighters to play as, but these characters are some of the most powerful in the game.                     Naturally, this kids' game is mostly for Nickelodeon fans who will get a thrill from just trying out the characters on the roster. However, if a child just wants to play an accessible fighter with a few friends, Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 should get the job done.
                          An exciting local or online co-op option on Game Pass, Moving Out 2 is perfect for parents to play with their kids. On paper, nothing sounds more mundane than moving furniture, but, similar to something like Overcooked!, Moving Out 2 transforms this tiring and frustrating part of life into a silly physics-based party game with an over-the-top presentation and story. This time around, movers will need to transfer houses' worth of items across parallel realities, a concept that presents plenty of interesting scenarios and visuals.
                         Although great for all ages, Moving Out 2 can be somewhat difficult. After all, this is effectively a puzzle game that challenges player(s) to decipher the best and most efficient route to carry each piece of furniture, all the while trying to work together rather than against each other.
       Little Kitty, Big City has a simple premise that is perfect for this type of game. Used to living the good life in a high-up apartment building, a black cat's world comes crashing down after they fall out of a window; now, they must eat fish, make a few friends, get petted by humans, and (hopefully) find their way back home. As they travel across the streets around their owner's apartment, the feline gets to solve a few puzzles while also taking on the occasional side quest to keep things interesting.
     Here is where players can find the map in Little Kitty, Big City.                     Relaxing and charming, Little Kitty, Big City offers the ideal escape from reality for people of all ages. While not particularly deep mechanically or thematically, the game is relentlessly cute and warm.
                          Even though they tend to have content suitable for all ages, restaurant sims focus so much on micromanagement that they can be overwhelming for young players. While not a complete exception, Rolling Hills is a bit more streamlined than most of the genre's entries, making it a better option for kids taking their first steps into this universe.
                         Furthermore, the cute visuals and wholesome setting combine to create a pretty relaxing and welcoming experience, one that offers some depth and challenge but does not go out of its way to punish players. If nothing else, children will likely enjoy the protagonist, a Sushi Bot with an adorable design and an affable personality.
                          Many games try to represent childlike wonder, but few titles capture the feeling as perfectly as Lil Gator Game. The story is simple: a brother wants his older sister to play with him like they used to when they were younger. Consequently, he sets out to plan a game so amazing that she will have no choice but to hang out. The protagonist's drive might be relatable to a lot of kids who have watched their siblings mature before their eyes or who simply just enjoy creating make-believe scenarios. Lil Gator Game has a certain nostalgic air that might hit the mark with older players; however, it is perfect for children.
     If players have a few hours of free time, they should try completing these ten games on Game Pass to earn 11,000 easy Gamerscore points.                     Moving past the premise, this game plays out like a fairly typical adventure, with light platforming, puzzles, and exploration. Lil Gator Game is not particularly long, and it can easily be completed in one afternoon. That said, the world is quite open, making it a fun sandbox to mess around in.
       Minecraft straddles a fine line between child-friendliness and complexity that makes it a practical must when it comes to kids’ game libraries. Its Creative Mode might seem like the obvious draw as it allows players to explore the breadth of their imagination and build without limitation.
     Xbox Game Pass is unquestionably worth the subscription fee, but which of the available games are the best use of your hard drive space?                     However, Survival Mode shouldn’t be overlooked either. Beyond the obvious thrill, it encourages creative problem-solving, and the mode's difficulty level can be customized to whatever degree of challenge is right and comfortable for the player.
      Minecraft Dungeons and Legends are spin-offs designed to be entry-level options for the action RPG and real-time strategy genres respectively. Although not as good as Minecraft, they are still among the best kids games on Game Pass.
       Plants vs. Zombies had a fairly active 2010s, but the franchise has yet to make an appearance in the current decade. While waiting for Plants vs. Zombies 3 to become a reality, players (and children) can jump into the previous titles, most of which are on Xbox Game Pass. While Battle for Neighborville is the most recent project, Garden Warfare 2 is generally regarded as the license's high point. Unlike the strategy-driven main titles, the Garden Warfare games are third-person shooters; that said, they still center around defending locations.
     Not all games are doom and gloom. Here are several with a clean, fresh feeling, just in time for spring.                     Released in 2016, Garden Warfare 2 was a visual treat at the time thanks to its animated character designs and colorful backdrops. Even all these years later, the game is still pleasing to the eyes. While not overly deep or complicated, the combat system is also pretty good and satisfying. Garden Warfare 2 is built upon classes, with both Plants and Zombies having a small but versatile selection at their disposal. While prioritizing multiplayer, the title does allow most modes to be played solo, replacing other players with AI. There is even something resembling a story mode, although it is not especially great.
       TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is a throwback to classic beat 'em up arcade games from the '90s, and it does an impeccable job of modernizing this genre. Offering seven playable characters, each of which is uniquely defined, Shredder's Revenge guides players through hard-hitting levels filled with references to old TMNT stories and games.
     TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is filled with awesome stages that pay homage to the Turtles' history, but which ones are the game's best?                     While certainly one of the better Game Pass games for kids, this title is quite difficult, and some of the campaign's later stages might be too much for younger players. That said, children are likely to have a blast controlling the Turtles as they take on the Foot Clan and other iconic villains from the franchise.
       Super Lucky's Tale is a middling platformer that garnered extra scrutiny since it launched alongside the Xbox One X. New Super Lucky's Tale takes 2017's release and greatly enhances it, crafting an experience that is superior in nearly every way. Along with packaging the levels from the DLC into the campaign, New Super Lucky's Tale adds camera control, fixing one of the biggest issues in the original version.
     Platformers were among the first games to take over home consoles, and with their current resurgence, it's time to look at the best of the genre.                     The Xbox is not associated with platformers, and while there are a couple of genre classics on Game Pass, New Super Lucky's Tale is a fresh option that should not be overlooked. The game will likely impress both young children and older players who are fans of platformers.
                          Farming sims are generally safe bets for young players, at least in terms of tone and content. However, the genre has gradually grown more complex over the last few decades, and projects like Stardew Valley dive so deeply into the “farming” part that they can be overwhelming. A remake of a GBA Harvest Moon classic, Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town’s handheld origins shine through its bare bones and straightforward mechanics. For sim veterans, the game’s streamlined nature could be regarded as a con; for kids taking their first steps onto a farm, Friends of Mineral Town is just about perfect.
                         Naturally, the game devotes most of its days to farm management, which is simplistic but enjoyable. However, as suggested by its title, Friends of Mineral Town’s NPCs are its strongest feature. Along with just mingling, players can even romance the locals and start a family, a mechanic the game handles in as wholesome a way as possible.
                          Xbox Game Pass has quite a wide selection of arcade racers, most of which are suitable for young players. Although not devoid of complexity or depth, these projects tend to have low bars for entry, presenting accessible controls that do not require too much finesse, precision, or experience. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbo Charged deserves a special mention since it literally revolves around toys; in fact, some kids might have a couple of the included cars stored somewhere in their rooms.
     It wouldn't be a Hot Wheels racing game without some lightning-fast cars thrown into the mix, but these ones go above and beyond in this department.                     Licensed games have a negative reputation stemming from decades of stitched-together shovelware with little value to offer anyone, including die-hard fans of the property. In recent years, the standard of these types of projects has risen thanks to properties like Lego, and Hot Wheels Unleashed has also played its part. While a bit light on content, Turbocharged is a fantastic racer in most ways, one that comes with an expansive selection of visually striking cars and consistently well-designed courses. Graphically, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 is a top contender for the best-looking racer on Game Pass, and it also plays like a dream.
                         The single-player campaign is short but generally sweet, and Turbocharged also has a decent selection of multiplayer options.
       Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has a pretty robust selection of sports games thanks to the membership including EA Play. While the latest entries are usually not available as they are added toward the end of their lifespans, players can get their fix of soccer, basketball, hockey, or football by indulging in the older releases that are on the subscription service. Technically, these games are all appropriate for children since their core gameplay is generally family friendly, even if they tend to lean into sim rather than arcade territory. However, these games all prioritize their online modes, which are better left for older players.
                         Fortunately, Super Mega Baseball 4 is the perfect alternative, not just for kids but also players who want something a touch more streamlined. Metalhead Studio has crafted an accessible sports game that harbors back to classic releases of the late ‘90s and early 2000s, all the while still offering quite a bit of depth. The latter largely comes in the form of customization, a mode that is so robust that it puts to shame many similar offerings contained within bigger AAA projects. On the field, matches play out as a hodgepodge of mini-games and arcade action, which is more fun than it sounds.
       SteamWorld loves nothing more than to try new genres, and nearly always to great success. While it might not go down as the franchise’s masterpiece as it does not quite reach the same heights as Dig or Heist, SteamWorld Build is nevertheless an impressive package. As the title suggests, the 2023 release is a city-builder, one that puts players in charge of a frontier town stuck on a planet that has seen better days.
     Starting out in Steamworld Build can be a little overwhelming. For those hoping to succeed, here are the buildings they should build first.                     Mechanically, Build primarily focuses on streamlining the genre’s traditional tropes, crafting an experience that caters to new (or young) players who might not be accustomed to city-builders. That’s not to say the game brings nothing fresh to the plate, as its setting and mining section are both unique, but it plays as expected.
                          Originally released as three short games, Frog Detective: The Entire Mystery is a cute and clever adventure game that has enough positives in its favor to keep both children and adults entertained. That said, the storytelling leans more toward the former demographic, particularly when it comes to its characters. As the title suggests, players are cast as a detective who just happens to be a frog, and they investigate three cases throughout the campaign. While the mysteries themselves are endearing but nothing too special, they are littered with funny and lively personalities who would not look out of place in a storybook or a children's TV show.
                         Gameplay-wise, Frog Detective does not have too much to offer since it is very stripped-down. At times, the game has elements of a visual novel, although there is a decent amount of interactivity. Older players might wish they could explore this world more thoroughly, but younger children might appreciate the more streamlined experience.
                          Those looking for a fun and engaging RPG adventure that is suitable for the whole family need to look no further than Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan. This colorful release features a large world filled with locations to explore and collectible creatures to discover.
                         In a variation of turn-based combat, players will find themselves attempting to communicate with their enemies to de-escalate conflicts. It also features platforming and puzzle-solving mechanics. Rainbow Billy's world is a sight to behold, and the story is imaginative. The eponymous boy must face off against the Leviathan, a process that requires bringing color back to the world.
                          Players who have fond memories of the LEGO Star Wars games will have an absolute blast with The Skywalker Saga, while young children can create some new memories with the license. This blockular, cartoony take on the modern trilogy features a wide cast of LEGO-fied characters in a fun and funny adventure across the galaxy. The combat is fun and the cooperative play means that kids and adults can play together through each mission.
     These beginner tips and tricks should prove invaluable for those who are just starting out on their Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga adventures.                     There are tons of things to unlock, and the humorous storyline is perfect for the whole family. The game is rated E10+ for its cartoon mischief and violence, but this Game Pass kids game is a rather wholesome adventure, especially for those who love the Star Wars series.
                          This one snuck up on many players and has quickly become one of the most enjoyable experiences of 2022. It's the perfect game for kids and families alike, thanks to its cavalcade of Disney characters and its colorful visuals. Rated E for Everyone, Disney Dreamlight Valley can be described as a mixture of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and The Sims. Players will be able to build their own Disney-esque areas, filling them with decorations, furniture, and more.
                         This is the perfect title to play together, and even grown-ups should get a kick out of the release, which features a wide array of classic and iconic Disney names.
                          The Viva Pinata games are quite aged at this point, having dropped in 2006 and 2008, but they were also part of the Rare Replay bundle back in 2015. Although Disney Dreamlight Valley boasts upgraded graphics and mechanics that are in line with other AAA titles in the modern era, Viva Pinata and its sequel exude some serious magic that helps differentiate them from the rest of the pack.
                         The games may be a little rough around the edges compared to other "farming simulators" but they are a fantastic family game that will have kids laughing as they care for a large stable of curious and colorful Pinata creatures.
                          Xbox Game Pass has Forza Horizon 4 and 5, both of which are fantastic driving games for young players. Unlike the mainline Motorsport series, Forza Horizon is a pure arcade racer that blends realistic open-worlds with over-the-top stunts that could make Fast and Furious blush. The fourth entry is set in and around Scotland's Edinburgh, which is a great setting by any metric; however, its successor's Mexico playground offers more visual variety due to its diverse biomes.
     Forza Horizon 5 players know that sometimes the fastest cars can be hard to control — but these ones handle smoothly and reach high speeds.                     While still offering a reasonable challenge for experienced players, Forza Horizon 5 is good for all ages. Kids can have a blast just exploring the large map, as they complete absurd jumps and unlock new shiny cars to play around with. The game does not have much of a story, and it generally opts for a cheesy tone.
