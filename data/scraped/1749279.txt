             The Craft Heinz Company is announcing that it is planning to build a distribution center in DeKalb. A news release from the company says that the 775,000 square-foot facility represents a $400 million investment. The facility is expected to create about 150 jobs when its operating. It's also to include state-of-the-art automation technology distributing more than sixty percent of the company's foodservice business and thirty percent of all dry goods. The distribution center is expected to be built within the next two years or so. DeKalb Mayor Cohen Barns says the construction and post-construction employment opportunities will have a positive and lasting impact on the area.
