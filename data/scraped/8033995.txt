 Reliance is reportedly developing a pocket-sized small speaker for its Jio Pay service. As per a report, the device is expected to be similar to Paytm’s unique sound box, which confirms and audibly announces successful transactions to merchants. The report also notes that Paytm has distributed millions of sound boxes to the market, making them available to merchants for a monthly fee of approximately Rs 129. It has transformed into a profitable subscription model. It also mentioned that these devices go beyond their sound alerts, offering valuable insights into how merchants operate.
