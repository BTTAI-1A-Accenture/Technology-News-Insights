 Meet Sohor Ali !  He is fiber to the backbone of how 75% Bangladeshi commutes on a daily basis. Ali, is the owner of an Electric Vehicle garage (housing Mishuks & Easy Bikes) His business was not scalable due to heavy CAPEX, dodgy scheme of lead acid battery manufacturers & rising electricity cost  98% of the market runs on ill suited Lead Acid (LA) Batteries Just like Ali, all thanks to technology, we have a strong belief that: "Underserved communities don’t need a cheap product, but high quality products made affordable" How is this problem getting solved: SOLshare's patented IoT technology is helping change LA to Lithium Ion (LFP) Battery    - (A vehicle on LFP p/day saves 3 KG CO2 emission reaching atmosphere)  "I am now truly in the driving seat of my business" - Sohor Ali, Nihan EV Garage Ali added: “ To keep my garage afloat, I strive for efficient growth every month; SOLshares technology helps me  reduce my CAPEX & OPEX, therefore improving bottom lines. This makes me more hopeful about tomorrow. My entrepreneurship drive has made me a more braver person, very happy to use technology in my small endeavor” Sohor Ali is not the only one, there are millions of them here. Our work here is just getting started as we see the very 1 signs of a Product Market Fit.  Truly synergy is key; a good display to things working wonders should sustainable financing, managed technology services, and entrepreneurial drive come together "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts!" , 3+2+1= 6 any given day!         Director, Product & Business at SOLshare International Pte.
