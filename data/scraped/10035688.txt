Top Gun: Maverick, Elvis and Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio were among the big film winners at the Motion Picture Sound Editors‘ 70th Golden Reel Awards, which were handed out Sunday night at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre in Los Angeles. See the full list below. 
Best Picture Oscar nominees Top Gun: Maverick from Paramount and Warner Bros’ Elvis won for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing, Feature Effects/Foley, and Music Editing for a Feature Motion Picture, respectively. Netflix’s Animated Feature Oscar hopeful Pinocchio, hot off dominating the Annie Awards on Saturday, took the prize for Outstanding Achievement in Sound Editing – Feature Animation.

	








 
	Two other Best Picture Oscar nominees — Netflix’s All Quiet on the Western Front and Searchlight’s The Banshees of Inisherin — also picked up trophies, as did the feature docs Good Night Oppy from Amazon and Moonage Daydream from Neon and HBO Documentary Films.

	Small-screen winners at MPSE‘s first in-person awards show since 2020 included Netflix’s Stranger Things — the only film or TV show to claim two Golden Reels — and Love, Death + Robots, which scored four Annie Awards on Saturday. Other TV winners included The Bear, The Crown and Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin.
 
	Sony’s video game God of War Ragnarok was the only double other Golden Reel winner tonight. 
	Elsewhere, Jerry Bruckheimer accepted MPSE’s Filmmaker Award, presented by Top Gun: Maverick director Joe Kosinski and producer-star Tom Cruise, the latter in a recorded intro. The Career Achievement Award went to supervising sound editor Gwendolyn Yates Whittle, a three-time Oscar nominee for Avatar: The Away of Water, Tron and Avatar.  
	“Sound editors play a crucial role in bringing films, television shows, and games to life,” MPSE President Mark Lanza said in his opening address. “This year, we have seen truly incredible sound editing. From the explosive action of blockbusters to the subtle nuances of character-driven dramas, sound editors have shown the power of sound to engage, entertain, and move us.” 
	Founded in 1953, the Motion Picture Sound Editors is a nonprofit group of professional sound and music editors who work in the motion picture, TV and gaming industries. 
	Here are the winners at MPSE’s 2023 Golden Reel Awards:
