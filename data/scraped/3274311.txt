You're getting an improved camera with 1536p resolution, color night vision, and head-to-toe video, allowing you to get a full view of who's at your door. Other features include two-day audio with quick replies, customizable motion zones, and up to three times the battery life of previous models.

Great upgrades from the original Ring Pro Resolution: 1536p HD | FOV: 150° horizontal, 150° vertical | Power: Hardwired | Dimensions: 4.49" x 1.9" x .87" The Ring Pro 2 was released in 2021 as an update to the best-selling Ring Pro and a launch price of $249.99 / £219 / AU$399.99. The Ring Pro comes packed with new features, such as a wider 150-degree square field of view and night vision so you can see more no matter the time of day. The Ring Video Doorbell is hardwired for non-stop power and includes HD+ video recording, two-way talk with Audio+, and  3D motion detection. You're also getting built-in Alexa greetings, so the Ring can automatically greet anyone who stops by and can give instructions to delivery drivers.  Ring's cheapest video doorbell Resolution: 1080p HD | FOV: 155° horizontal, 90° vertical | Power: Hardwired | Dimensions: 3.98" x 1.81" x .88" The Ring Video Doorbell Wired was released in 2021 with a starting price of $59.99/£49, making it the most affordable Ring device. As the name implies, the Ring Doorbell requires wiring and doesn't have a battery option. This means you'll get constant power, but for some, it won't be compatible with your current doorbell's chime, so you'll need to buy the Ring Chime if you want to hear an alert in your home. The Ring Video Doorbell Wired also includes HD video, two-way talk, night vision, and advanced motion detection.  Motion detection with custom sensors Resolution: 1080p HD | FOV: 155° horizontal, 90° vertical | Power: Battery or Hardwired | Dimensions: 5.0" x 2.5" x 1.0" The second edition of the Ring Video Doorbell, this device features several improvements over the original model. For one, the rechargeable battery pack is more easily removable. The Ring camera also features 1080p video (instead of 720p) which provides clean and sharp footage. The 2020 Ring Doorbell has a greater horizontal field-of-view and comes with two interchangeable faceplates. The Ring Doorbell will also send alerts to your smartphone, tablet, or laptop when motion is detected and lets you check-in on your home from anywhere with live on-demand video and audio. The Ring features two-way talk so you can hear and talk to visitors and works with Amazon Alexa.  Adjustable motion zones Resolution: 1080p HD | FOV: 160° horizontal, 84° vertical | Power: Hardwired | Dimensions: 5.1" x 2.4" x 1.1" The 2020 Ring Doorbell 3 has all the features of the Pro but now features improved motion detection with fewer false notifications than past generations because of the addition of a 'near zone'. You're also getting new security features with the Control Center so you can add and remove authorized client devices, shared users, and select linked accounts–all from one place on your phone, tablet, or PC. The Ring 3 also now includes a rechargeable battery pack or connects to doorbell wires for constant power.

Like the other Ring doorbell models, the Ring 3 gives instant alerts once motion is detected and lets you customize your motion zones.

The Ring Pro is hardwired as you would a normal doorbell, so you don't have to worry about recharging its battery. The Ring Pro also updated its design with a smaller and sleeker look. Like the 2nd edition Ring, it also supports 1080p video and includes four different interchangeable faceplates. The Ring Pro sends alerts to your smartphone, laptop or tablet when motion is detected and offers two-way talk.
