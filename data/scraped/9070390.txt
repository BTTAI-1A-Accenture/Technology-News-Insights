People with hay fever can expect more problems from Wednesday as the amount of spring pollen in the air reaches a peak, broadcaster NOS said. This year, people allergic to grass pollen in particular are suffering because volumes are more concentrated than usual. The amount of grass pollen in the air is always high in May but is worse in 2023 because of the wet spring. “It has been dry for a few years and that led to less pollen, but now everything is in full bloom,” Wageningen University biologist Arnold van Vliet said. And with no rain forecast for the coming days, hay fever patients are being fully exposed to the pollen, he said. The Netherlands has two pollen measuring stations, one in Leiden and one in Helmond.
