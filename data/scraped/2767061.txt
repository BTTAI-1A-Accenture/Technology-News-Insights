Shemesh’s TKS-C60 ensures a seamless, uninterrupted bottling line for a range of products from creams and foundations to fragrances and nail polish at a rate of 60 bottles/min. The line consists of three ABB Delta Robots – one on the product unscrambling station, one for accurate multi-capping and one for case packing – as well as an integrated advanced vision system. All manufactured by one experienced team, to maximize productivity and minimize downtime. This smart technology is manufactured from high grade stainless steel. Two lanes offer greater flexibility, with the capability to pack different products on the same line simply by setting up the requisite recipes via a smart HMI screen. The linear rather than rotary feed means there are fewer parts for faster and easier changeovers and cleaning. It can identify cap types of any dimension – screw caps, snap-on caps, pump/spray caps, and more. For shaped products, the line can also include pucks loaders and unloaders as well – offering maximum flexibility.
