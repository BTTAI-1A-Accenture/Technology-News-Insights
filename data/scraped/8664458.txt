“Paul Moehlman is an Algonac graduate who was diagnosed with brain cancer last August,” Blair said. “We are hoping to raise as much money as we possibly can for Paul and his medical expenses. He is an awesome guy who knows everyone in town and has a positive, inspirational approach to living with a terminal diagnosis.”She said the event is family friendly, and kids and pets are welcome to participate. She also noted that the course is the same as last year. It is a 4.3-mile fun walk/run, and this year it has been opened up to golf carts, too.“The race will start at 9 a.m. from the front of Algonac Jr./Sr. High School, 5200 Taft Road, Algonac,” she said. “It will end at the Clay Township Pavilion in the Clay Township Park. At the pavilion there will be fruit, muffins, granola bars and water. Throughout the course there will be water stations, as well.”“And, of course, throughout the course there will be powder stations,” she continued. “Each participant gets their Color Run T-shirt, and one of the goals of the event is to get your shirt covered in colorful powder. Each participant will also get a powder pack that will be disbursed at the park to create a cloud of powder.”Proceeds from last year’s event supported Joan DeRue, also known as Jodi, who owned and operated the store Quilting Dreams in Marine City. DeRue died in January.

“Jodi’s family is attending this year and plan to attend every year to get together, help others and remember Jodi,” Blair said.She said that two previous Color Out Cancer Run recipients will also be present at the event: former Algonac High School students Natalie Thomason and Jason Moehlman, Paul Moehlman’s son.“Both were battling life-threatening illnesses; Natalie while in high school and Jason just after graduation,” she said. “They will attend the event and walk it.”Blair said that organizers began planning this year’s event in November 2022, when they chose the recipient and started holding meetings.She said that last year was a record-breaking year for attendance, with 134 people participating, and that over $6,500 was raised for DeRue.“Much of that money came from donations through the RunSignup website,” she said. “There were over $1,700 in donations alone. Those who wish to help, but might not be able to make the event, are encouraged to visit runsignup.com, click on ‘Find a Race’ and search for ‘Algonac High School – Color Out Cancer Run 2023’ and make a donation there. They can also donate by contacting me.”Blair said organizers will be in front of the school at 8 a.m., so people who would like to register that morning should get there early. Those who are registered through runsignup.com just need to check in and get their shirt.“There are places in the school to change,” Blair said. “There are bandanas that each person receives and we encourage participants to write ‘Pauly Strong’ on it or to write the name of their loved one that they are walking in remembrance of, too. It is a fun event and a way to bring the community together to help others.”The cost to participate is $40 for adults and $30 for those ages 6 to 17.
