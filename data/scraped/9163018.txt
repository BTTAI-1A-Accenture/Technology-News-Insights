 Now  74  Sun  95  Mon  90 by Daniela Ibarra, KTUL Staff TOPICS: TULSA, Okla. â€” Berry season is kicking off this week for one Owasso farmer. The start of the season depends on the weather, according to Bill Jacobs with the Owasso Christmas Tree & Berry Farm. "They basically grow pretty easily by themselves," Jacobs said of the blackberries he started growing about 20 years ago. He added blueberry plants into the mix about 15 years ago. The sweet summer berries bring back memories for him. "As a kid growing up on a farm, I'd love to go and pick those blackberries along the creek bank," he said. Each year, Jacobs estimates the farm produces over 20,000 berries.  "It's something that people love that turned out to be a good investment," he said. While it's been a good investment, the drought has dried up some of Jacobs' revenue. "Last year we paid the biggest water bills we've ever paid," he said. "We paid $2,000 a month for three months -- July, August, September." Jacobs said Oklahoma's weather can make or break the crops. "Need a good rain once a week, if not we irrigate it, he said. "So, it gets too hot and windy, the fruit will dry on the vine and deteriorate." There's a lot of picking and pruning Jacobs does to make the crops look great. "We do a lot of mulching to keep the weeds and grass abay and makes for a nice clean plant and eliminates the competition. " Jacobs credits an irrigation system to keep the berries nice and juicy. "It's not the best crop we ever had but it's gonna be a good crop," he said. You can start picking blueberries at the Owasso Christmas Tree and Berry Farm June 6, with blackberries expected to be ripe the following week. The farm is open Tuesday and Thursday from 7 a.m. to 12 p.m. and Saturday from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
