It is thought dozens more survived after the vessel broke apart. According to the BBC, the boat was trying to land with around 150 people aboard. The incident happened near the coastal town of Crotone in the Calabria region. Many bodies have already been recovered from the beach nearby. While earlier, the coastguard said around 80 people have been recovered alive. Local officials are thought to have said the death toll is at either 58 or 59. Those onboard were mainly from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Iran, according to Italian officials, and President Sergio Mattarella said many were fleeing "very difficult conditions". One survivor was arrested on migrant trafficking charges, customs police said. The vessel is said to have sunk after crashing against rocks during rough weather. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed "deep sorrow" following the incident. "It is inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the price of the 'ticket' they paid in the false perspective of a safe journey," she said in a statement. "The government is committed to preventing departures, and with them the unfolding of these tragedies, and will continue to do so."
