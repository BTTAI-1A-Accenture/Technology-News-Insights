JetBlue Flight 206 forced to go from 87 feet to 3,900 feet to avoid collision The National Transportation Safety Board confirmed to NewsCenter 5 that the independent federal agency is investigating why a Learjet decided to take of from Boston Logan International Airport Monday evening without permission, nearly causing a catastrophic collision with a JetBlue plane that was attempting to land.  According to a preliminary review from the Federal Aviation Administration, the pilot of a Learjet 60 took off without clearance while JetBlue Flight 206 was preparing to land on an intersecting runway shortly before 7 p.m., the FAA said. An air traffic controller instructed the pilot of the Learjet to line up and wait on Runway 9 while the JetBlue Embraer 190 landed on Runway 4-Right, which intersects Runway 9, the FAA said.  "The Learjet pilot read back the instructions clearly, but began a takeoff roll instead," the FAA said. "The pilot of the JetBlue aircraft took evasive action and initiated a climb-out as the Learjet crossed the intersection." The JetBlue plane was forced to go from 87 feet to 3,900 feet to avoid a collision.  "On Monday, February 27, JetBlue flight 206 landed safely in Boston after our pilots were instructed to perform a go-around by air traffic controllers," a JetBlue spokesperson said. "Safety is JetBlueâ€™s first priority and our crews are trained to react to situations like this. We will assist authorities as they investigate this incident, and further inquiries should be directed to them." According to flight records available through Google, JetBlue Flight 206 was arriving in Boston from Nashville. "We're hitting the ground and then going back up within seconds. You definitely got a jolt, and then nobody knew what was going on," said Joe Bisbee, who was aboard JetBlue Flight 206. "Once we got far enough up, the plane was to the side. We were definitely having to take some sharp turns, so it was definitely really scary," said Lilly Sternburg, another passenger on that JetBlue flight.

The Learjet was operated by Hop-A-Jet, a private charter company. The FAA will determine the closest proximity between the two aircraft as part of the investigation. "I just hope that the FAA is able to get to the bottom of it and somebody gets held accountable for this," Bisbee said. "I mean, lives were at stake and it's not right." Monday's incident at Logan Airport was the fifth close call involving commercial aircraft in recent months nationwide, according to ABC News. "I think the only thing that we're seeing, the only common thread we're seeing throughout these mishaps, is human error. Somebody made a mistake in the cockpit and a control tower," Steve Ganyard, ABC News contributor and aviation expert, said. "That's where the FAA will start." In February, FAA Administrator Billy Nolen said that he was putting together a team of experts to review airline safety.
