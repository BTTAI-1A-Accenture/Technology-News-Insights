Most Widely Read Newspaper •Source: www.campuslit.com Kindly share this story: The Information and Communication Technology sector in Nigeria has seen significant growth and development in recent years. The National Bureau of Statistics revealed that the sector contributed 18.44 per cent to the nation’s GDP in the second quarter of 2022. Experts argue that the country’s large youthful population is driving demand for ICT products and services.
Of course, there are several challenges that the ICT sector in Nigeria faces. They include the lack of reliable and affordable electricity, multiple taxations, regulatory bottlenecks, limited access to ICT infrastructure in rural areas, and a dearth of skilled ICT professionals. Despite these challenges, the sector has continued to grow with the potential to play a significant role in the country’s economic development.
Looking ahead into 2023, increased adoption of cloud computing is one of the potential trends that may shape the development of ICT. As businesses in Nigeria find means to reduce costs and improve efficiency, many will turn to cloud computing solutions to store and process data.
The growth of the e-commerce industry is another potential trend. Nigeria’s large and rapidly growing population and the adoption of mobile devices and internet access have made e-commerce more accessible. With improvements in electronic payment and logistics sectors, the growth trend is likely to continue this year. The expansion of mobile broadband will also drive development. The proliferation of mobile broadband is expected to continue in Nigeria, driven by the increasing demand for data services and the roll-out of 4G and 5G networks. The Nigerian Communications Commission in 2021 granted 5G licenses to MTN Nigeria and Mafab Communications, with Airtel joining the party last year December. MTN is known to have rolled out services in certain cities. 2023 holds promises of more roll-outs and improved access to 5G services in general. 






There is an undeniable rise of fintech as the industry in Nigeria has seen significant growth in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue as more people turn to digital financial services. Reports suggest that there are over 200 Fintech firms in Nigeria rapidly helping to bridge the financial inclusion gap. The fintech ecosystem covers businesses focused on mobile payments, digital banking, merchant solutions and personal finance among others.  Related News  ICT sector to benefit from forex access – W’Bank  ICT sector contributes N5.5tn to GDP in six months  Group seeks better collaboration in Nigeria’s ICT sector   
What about the increasing use of artificial intelligence? The use of AI in various sectors, including healthcare, education, and agriculture, is expected to increase in Nigeria as the country looks to leverage technology to solve problems and improve services. The early players here include Lare Ayoola’s IoT Africa Networks Limited, Kobo360 and Data Scientists Network.
The growth of the outsourcing industry is another developmental trend because Nigeria’s highly educated workforce and lower labour costs make it an attractive destination for outsourcing. This trend is likely to continue as companies look to outsource certain business functions to save costs, improve productivity and boost profitability. Also, with the increased adoption of digital skills, the ICT sector continues to grow, thereby prompting greater demand for individuals with digital skills.        
This trend is likely to drive the development of training programmes and initiatives to help people acquire the necessary skills. Governments at different levels are making tremendous efforts in this space. The National Information Technology Development Agency through its subsidiary, the National Center for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, is training one million developers with a focus on Python for machine learning and data science.
ICT will remain a significant proportion of the economy in the foreseeable future. Human capacity development and infrastructure deployment will however dominate the ICT space in 2023.
 Happy new year.
