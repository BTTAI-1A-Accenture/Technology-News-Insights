Changes are incoming for the likes of Google News, Google Play Books, and Gboard. Find the full breakdown below. Wear OS is getting lots of love in this update, and itâ€™s not limited to the latest version or the Pixel Watch, either. Google is also announcing a new feature for Google One on Android devices and supported browsers dubbed the Dark Web report. The feature allows users in the US to run scans of their email addresses to check for security compromises. US users can also scan their social security numbers in the same way. This feature will eventually roll out to more than a dozen additional countries in the coming months.
