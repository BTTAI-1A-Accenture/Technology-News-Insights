This positive price change could be due to a paper published yesterday by the IMF and the G20’s Financial Stability Board. The paper suggested that an outright ban on all cryptocurrencies wouldn't be effective in the long term and recommended using targeted rules and a comprehensive monetary strategy instead. Meanwhile, Ethereum is currently trading above $1,600.” Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, “The crypto market has picked up for the second consecutive day. As per CoinGecko, the global crypto market capitalisation, up 1.2 percent, remains above $1.09 trillion. The fear and greed index also jumped 5 points since yesterday and is currently in the fear zone with a score of 46/100. The investor sentiment seems to have been slightly boosted after news about JPMorgan Chase & Co. exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system — a sign that companies are still building in the bear phase. If implemented, this may further institutional adoption for the industry.” Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, said, “Bitcoin experienced an upswing, surpassing the $26,000 resistance level, while Ether made modest gains but stayed below $1,650. JPMorgan is aiming to develop a blockchain-based digital deposit token for cross-border payments, pending US regulatory approval. Such tokens streamline blockchain deposits, offering speed and cost advantages.” Shivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, “The IMF-FSB paper highlights key issues associated with the current state of digital assets and calls for sustained implementation of policies to mitigate the risks associated with crypto assets. The reporting of transactions, taxation, licensing of exchanges, and monitoring of capital inflows are some of the recommendations in the paper which have been curated after detailed consultation with industry stakeholders. The paper was released yesterday and had a positive impact on the crypto market as the global crypto market cap is $1.05 trillion, a 1.03 percent increase over the last day. The crypto heavyweights like BTC and ETH are also up by 1.76 percent and 0.64 percent, respectively.”  Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabplive Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
