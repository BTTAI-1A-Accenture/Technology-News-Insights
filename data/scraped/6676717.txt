Sale of Global Products Complete, Moving Forward with Return of Proceeds   LEXINGTON, Ky.,  May 10, 2023  /PRNewswire/ -- Valvoline Inc. (NYSE: VVV), a trusted leader in preventive automotive maintenance delivering quick and convenient service, today reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 . All comparisons in this press release are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise noted. "With the sale of the Global Products business complete, Valvoline is wholly focused on driving long-term value to shareholders through our best-in-class retail platform by growing system-wide store sales, increasing units through both company-operated and franchised additions, and evolving the service portfolio over time," said Sam Mitchell, CEO. "Valvoline continues to see resiliency and strength in the demand for the quick, easy and trusted preventive maintenance service we provide to our customers, demonstrated by 26% adjusted EBITDA growth on 19% adjusted sales growth1 year over year for the quarter."  1 Excluding suspended operations of a former Global Products business that was not included in the sale.

"As expected, we saw EBITDA margin improvement in the second quarter, largely driven by top-line growth and improved SG&A leverage," said Lori Flees, President, Retail Services. "Both our store team members and franchise partners continue to deliver results demonstrated by the 13.5% system-wide same store sales growth this quarter," continued Flees. "The strong same store sales are coming from growth in transactions, non-oil change service penetration and pricing. As we approach the summer travel season, our stores are well staffed and prepared to continue driving growth in the back half of the year." Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Outlook "The second quarter results were in line with our expectations and we remain on track to meet our FY23 targets. We also expect the margin improvement we saw during Q2 to continue in the back half of the year." said Mitchell.  "This quarter we reached the final milestone on our path to becoming a pure-play, automotive services company with closing the sale of the Global Products business. After thoughtful consideration, management and our board of directors concluded that a modified "Dutch auction" tender offer would allow us to most efficiently and expeditiously return a substantial portion of the net sale proceeds to our investors," continued Mitchell. "We are excited to focus on driving growth of the new Valvoline. Our long-term model of generating high return on invested capital through growing the core business, expanding the network and evolving with the car parc positions us for a long runway of growth and creating significant value for shareholders."  The Company's outlook for fiscal 2023 is unchanged. Information is provided in the table below:  Fiscal 2023 Outlook   System-wide SSS growth   8   -   12 %   System-wide store additions   130   -   160   Company-operated   80   -   90   Franchised   50   -   70   System-wide store sales growth   16   -   20 %   Net revenues   $1.4   -   $1.5 billion   Net revenues growth   14   -   18 %   Adjusted EBITDA   $370   -   $390 million   Capital expenditures   $170   -   $200 million   Adjusted effective tax rate   25.5   -   26.5 %   Adjusted net income   $160   -   $180 million  Valvoline's outlook for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and the adjusted effective tax rate are non-GAAP financial measures that are expected to be impacted by items affecting comparability. Valvoline is unable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures estimated for fiscal 2023 without unreasonable efforts, as the Company is currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact these GAAP measures in fiscal 2023 but would not impact non-GAAP adjusted results. Tender Offer for Common Stock Today, Valvoline is announcing its intention to commence a modified "Dutch auction" tender offer for up to $1 billion in value of shares of its common stock, subject to market conditions, at a specified price range that is yet to be determined. The tender offer will form part of Valvoline's $1.6 billion share repurchase authorization announced on November 15, 2022 . Conference Call Webcast Valvoline will host a live audio webcast of its fiscal second quarter 2023 conference call today, May 10, 2023, at 9 a.m. ET. The webcast and supporting materials will be accessible through Valvoline's website at http://investors.valvoline.com. Following the live event, an archived version of the webcast and supporting materials will be available. Key Business Measures Valvoline tracks its operating performance and manages its business using certain key measures, including system-wide, company-operated and franchised store counts and SSS; and system-wide store sales. Management believes these measures are useful to evaluating and understanding Valvoline's operating performance and should be considered as supplements to, not substitutes for, Valvoline's sales and operating income, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Net revenues are influenced by the number of service center stores and the business performance of those stores. Stores are considered open upon acquisition or opening for business. Temporary store closings remain in the respective store counts with only permanent store closures reflected in the activity and end of period store counts. SSS is defined as net revenues by U.S. stores (company-operated, franchised and the combination of these for system-wide SSS), with new stores, including franchised conversions, excluded from the metric until the completion of their first full fiscal year in operation as this period is generally required for new store sales levels to begin to normalize. Net revenues are limited to sales at company-operated stores, in addition to royalties and other fees from independent franchised and Express Care stores. Although Valvoline does not recognize store-level sales from franchised stores as net revenues in its Statements of Consolidated Income, management believes system-wide and franchised SSS comparisons, store counts, and total system-wide store sales are useful to assess market position relative to competitors and overall store and operating performance. Use of Non-GAAP Measures The following non-GAAP measures are included herein: Adjusted net revenues; EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin; adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share; and free cash flow and discretionary free cash flow. Refer to the tables herein for management's definition of each non-GAAP measure and reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Non-GAAP measures include adjustments from results based on U.S. GAAP that management believes enables comparison of certain financial trends and results between periods and provides a useful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance that allows for transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating the business and measuring performance. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation from, an alternative to, or more meaningful than, the financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated. The manner used to compute the non-GAAP information used by management may differ from the methods used by other companies and may not be comparable. Refer to the Appendix at the end of this release for descriptions of the adjustments that depart from the computations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. About Valvoline Inc.

Valvoline Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries   Appendix - Description of Non-GAAP Measures and Adjustments   EBITDA Measures   Management believes EBITDA measures provide a meaningful supplemental presentation of Valvoline's operating performance between periods on a comparable basis due to the depreciable assets associated with the nature of the Company's operations, as well as income tax and interest costs related to Valvoline's tax and capital structures, respectively.   Free Cash Flow and Discretionary Free Cash Flow   Management uses free cash flow and discretionary free cash flow as additional non-GAAP metrics of cash flow generation. By including capital expenditures and certain other adjustments, as applicable, management is able to provide an indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities. Free cash flow includes the impact of capital expenditures, providing a supplemental view of cash generation. Discretionary free cash flow includes maintenance capital expenditures, which are routine uses of cash that are necessary to maintain the Company's operations and provides a supplemental view of cash flow generation to maintain operations before discretionary investments in growth. Free cash flow and discretionary free cash flow have certain limitations, including that they do not reflect adjustments for certain non-discretionary cash flows, such as mandatory debt repayments.   Adjusted Net Revenue and Profitability Measures   Adjusted net revenue and profitability measures (i.e., adjusted net income, diluted earnings per share and EBITDA) enable the comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may not be reflective of the Company's underlying and ongoing operational performance or vary independent of business performance.   Key Items   The non-GAAP measures used by management exclude the impact of certain unusual, infrequent or non-operational activity not directly attributable to the underlying business, which management believes impacts the comparability of operational results between periods ("key items"). Key items are often related to legacy matters or market-driven events considered by management to not be reflective of the ongoing operating performance. Key items may consist of adjustments related to: legacy businesses, including the separation from Valvoline's former parent company, the former Global Products reportable segment, and associated impacts of related activity and indemnities; non-service pension and other postretirement plan activity; restructuring-related matters, including organizational restructuring plans, the separation of Valvoline's businesses, significant acquisitions or divestitures, debt extinguishment and modification, and tax reform legislation; in addition to other matters that management considers non-operational, infrequent or unusual in nature.  Refer to the below for descriptions of the key items that comprise the adjustments which depart from the computations in accordance with U.S. GAAP:   Net pension and other postretirement plan expenses (income): Includes several elements impacted by changes in plan assets and obligations that are primarily driven by the debt and equity markets, including remeasurement gains and losses, when applicable; and recurring non-service pension and other postretirement net periodic activity, which consists of interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits. Management considers that these elements are more reflective of changes in current conditions in global markets (in particular, interest rates), outside the operational performance of the business, and are also legacy amounts that are not directly related to the underlying business and do not have an impact on the compensation and benefits provided to eligible employees for current service.   Net legacy and separation-related expenses: Activity associated with legacy businesses and the separation from Valvoline's former parent company and its former Global Products reportable segment. This activity includes the recognition of and adjustments to indemnity obligations to its former parent company; certain legal, financial, professional advisory and consulting fees; and other expenses incurred by the continuing operations in connection with and directly related to these separation transactions and legacy matters. This incremental activity directly attributable to legacy matters and separation transactions is not considered reflective of the underlying operating performance of the Company's  continuing operations.   Of specific note, the Company recognized $24.4 million of pre-tax expense during the six months ended March 31, 2023 to reflect its increased estimated indemnity obligation, which also resulted in an income tax benefit of $26.5 million to reflect the release of valuation allowances in connection with the amendment of the Tax Matters Agreement with Valvoline's former parent company.   Information technology transition costs: Consist of redundant expenses incurred from duplicative technology platforms required while implementing the Company's stand-alone enterprise resource planning software system during fiscal 2023 and transitioning its data centers during fiscal 2022. These expenses are reflective of incremental costs directly associated with technology transitions and are not considered to be reflective of the ongoing expenses of operating the Company's technology platforms.   Suspended operations: Represents the results of a former Global Products business where operations  were suspended during fiscal 2022 that were not included in the sale. These results are not indicative of the operating performance of the Company's ongoing continuing operations.   Investment-related costs: Expense recognized to reduce the carrying value of an investment interest determined to be impaired. This cost is not considered to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Company's ongoing continuing operations.   Debt modification costs: Relates to the modification of the Senior Credit Agreement and includes the accelerated amortization of previously capitalized debt issuance costs, as well as third-party fees expensed in connection with the execution of the amended Senior Credit Agreement. These expenses are not considered to be indicative of the future servicing costs of the Company's ongoing debt facilities.  SOURCE Valvoline Inc.
