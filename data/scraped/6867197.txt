The futuristic farm uses shipping containers to grow leafy greens and herbs, then quickly distribute them to community retail partners.  "So through that, we're able to get fresh product to a lot of urban areas that necessarily wouldn't receive fresh product," said Joey Hightower, the general manager of Square Roots.  Each shipping container can produce the same amount of product as one acre of farmland. Right now, the operation is churning out around 1,000 pounds of produce per week.  Hightower said that's only about 50% of the capacity they could produce.  "Our process goes from seed to harvest on average about 26 days. So much sooner than traditional farming because we control the entire process here in our [climate-controlled] zones," said Hightower. With the operation being in 100% climate-controlled indoor environments, there's no need to use pesticides or worry about weather conditions.  "By controlling that whole process, we're able to ensure that the plant health is strong throughout the whole grow cycle," said Hightower.  Square Roots is partnered with Gordon Food Services, which is how the product is able to get to local retail partners so quickly.  "Our product that's harvested in the morning could potentially be on a chef's table in the afternoon," said Hightower. "This is the future of farming."
