     Bear attack survivor John Swartz describes how he came face-to-face with a black bear digging through garbage in his garage on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' John Swartz was left with a scar and a story after coming face-to-face with a black bear in his garage. The Pennsylvania man managed to escape, but only after the bear left its mark. Swartz went into his garage around 8:45 p.m. one evening last week to turn off a hose. With no light, he stepped his way through the garage until he felt for the spigot. He bent down at knee level when the black bear turned and sunk its teeth into his head. "It just blindsided me," Swartz said on "Jesse Watters Primetime" Thursday. "I had no clue there was anything in there."
