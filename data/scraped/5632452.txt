Thereâ€™s still time to enjoy the 2022 Holiday Lights on the Lake Light Show. The free display at Ascarate Park, 6900 Delta Drive, is presented by the El Paso County Parks & Recreation Department, in collaboration with Fred Loya Partners L.P. There will be a festival feel, with holiday vendors, food trucks, spectacular light shows and special holiday guests on the weekends. Animated light shows play each Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening from 6 to 9 p.m., with shows scheduled each weekend through Christmas Day. The holiday light displays will be lit through Jan. 6 for the community to walk through and enjoy from 5 to 9:45 p.m., with gates to Ascarate Park closing at 10 p.m. Need a break?
