The news doing the rounds within the Sonic fandom at the moment is about the possible return of the blue blur's "spin dash" mechanic. It seems game director Morio Kishimoto has seemingly confirmed this move is indeed making its return, after some leaks surfaced online. Here's a rough translation via Google: Morio Kishimoto: "! ? Oh my God, you found out! ! Actually, we tried to include it in the first update, but we decided that it didn't meet everyone's expectations, so we're improving the degree of perfection for the second update." As noted in the above tweet, it's apparently scheduled for the second post-launch update. This particular wave will also contain Sonic's Birthday, an Open Zone Challenge and new Koco, and will be followed by a third major update later this year containing new playable characters and story.

Comments 34  Here’s a little fun fact the spin dash wasn’t in the base game because the playtesters would only use the spin dash and nothing else. I guess they changed their mind  When will we get the Super Peel Out (Charge Dash) for Sonic Frontiers? I like that more than the spin dash.  I've really enjoyed coming back to this game for the first update. From this point on whatever comes next i'm super excited about, especially the new story and characters!  More content especially free, is great! I enjoyed the last update as well, just please, update it to include one song, I need I am all of me! It’s a crime that it isn’t there!  yay for finishing games way after they release weve devolved into waiting for literal gameplay mechanics now, lmao  @Greatluigi they shouldve fixed it then released it with the game. having no spin-dash feels off in this game  My sources are telling me that the spin attack will be in dlc, a year after Tears of the Kingdom releases.  @nomither6 Does it though? You've got the Boost. Granted that has, on some objects, the same launching properties as the Sonic Adventure era Spin Dash. But I suppose it would be the first 3D implementation of the move since 2006, and the game does have the first implementation of the Drop Dash in 3D so it is a little odd it was absent.  I don’t want patches, I don’t want dlc, I don’t want any “challenges” and other mobile things and I don’t want content road map in major supposedly quality legacy titles like that. I don’t want any of that. It makes great video games cheap, very middle, very western regular, very banchmarkie, very sales team and investors oriented. It basically kills fun and excitement. Japanese developers should leave this rotten business focused model for good.  @Friscobay On the contrary imo i feel that rolling out content post launch has many benefits in the long run. This kind of practice keeps the community surrounding the game engaged and entertained along with being excited about new stuff being added. Also it builds up hype for what's to come in the future (see Wave 3: new story, characters) and people never stop to talk about the game resulting in more players discovering it.  @Friscobay I get what you are saying, but there are some major benefits to keeping the player base engaged in their title long term as it keeps the conversation around the game active - so it's not actually bad thing IMO. I think I would agree if this was extra stuff added back in to make a incomplete game complete, but Sonic Frontiers has more than enough content without any of these free extras anyway. And that's the thing - it's all FREE additional content - so there's only anything but gain here for the consumer, which ultimately is not something heard often enough in this industry.  @Friscobay The way they'd do it in the past was way worse. Sonic 2 was basically a level pack for Sonic 1 and a patch that added in the spin charge ability - an hour of content for the equivalent of like $100-120. Wow, truly the good old days. Capcom kept releasing what would now be patches or DLC as full games with Street Fighter II, and what would simply be DLC level packs as full games with Mega Man. Each one for the equivalent of around $100 or so. Same with most series; a whole new entry would be merely a level pack or patch in effect. Imagine if a year after Sonic Frontiers came out, Sonic Frontiers 2 released and it was just an hour of new levels with a new move and was priced at over $100. Imagine how badly that would go down. That's the way they used to do it. Alternatively imagine back on the SNES if Street Fighter II only cost half of what it actually did, and instead of having to buy another four full priced games to keep up with the current state of the game (meaning you'd now spent hundreds of dollars for what were basically patches) you could just connect your SNES to the internet and download the changes for free, and pay a small amount for the new Super characters when they were added.  Why do modern games always have to add things, that might improve the experience, much later? This is one of the reason I hate modern gaming so much.  @Mauzuri So you'd rather the game beat itself? What's the point in playing it then? What's wrong with any of the puzzles anyway? Most of them teach you gameplay mechanics.  @Matroska I can't tell if you're actually being real here or not. But you see Sonic 2... as a level pack for Sonic 1? XD So by that logic, Super Mario World must be bolt on content to Super Mario Bros 3 but with less abilities, Crash Bandicoot 2/3 are just overpriced level packs originally designed for Crash 1. Horizon Forbidden West most certainly plays the same as Horizon Zero Dawn, so the new map is clearly just DLC... how... HOW could they?! Honestly though implying that most sequels are just an extension of the base game and that developers had the audacity to charge customers full price for their new work is nonsense. (note: I do agree with your use of Super Street Fighter II Analogy however) If your comment is specifically tied to the amount of content you get in these games - then it's just a sign of the times and how the mentality behind this has evolved and changed over the generations. The original Sonic's were designed for arcade-style replay-ability (like a lot of that era's titles) and these early on price points are absolutely valid. It's also why titles like Sonic Mania get sold at a budgeted RRP these days. Ironically, Sonic Mania would have probably been a better example for you contextualise your argument here considering their repacking and repurposing of content and then their distributing of the 'Plus' DLC.  Oh boy, a way to maybe get through this awful game faster 😁  Okay so I haven't played Frontiers yet but... are they really adding a core movement mechanic post-release? Normally in 3D platformers, the level design is based around the moveset of the main character, right??? though i honestly wouldn't be surprised if sonic frontiers just "forgot" about this game design principle...  @Sonicka Sonic 2 is Sonic 1 with a spin dash, different levels, and an optional side character. Sonic 2 was able to release one year after Sonic 1 for a reason.  Just gonna leave this here...  @NotoriousWhiz - yes, but calling a sequel "the same plus more" whilst equating this to DLC by today's landscape is incredibly disingenuous and not a very comparable model between the development cycles of that era in comparison to now. There's also the consideration that Sonic 1 was made in Japan, and Sonic 2 was made by STI in America when Sonic Team split off into two with Japan's staff focusing their efforts on Sonic CD, that shouldn't really be dismissed either - if anything this makes the release turnaround all the more impressive. A short development cycle wasn't an uncommon practise if you look back at sequel releases for the 90's. There are hundreds of titles that came out within 12 months of each other (even on Playstation). The cycles for development time were simply a lot shorter back then (for better or worse). **Incidentally - I actually find Sonic 3 & Knuckles to be a bigger leap in iteration and evolution of the IP overall - but Sonic 2 is still beloved by the majority for a reason.  Oh heck yes! That is probably one of the only abilities left that I miss Sonic having. I am happy to hear this.  The fact that it was missing spin dash to begin with highlights that this doesn't even feel like a Sonic game. 😥😓  Still waiting for the game to be fully complete before buying it. had an absolute blast playing the ps5 trial.  @Matroska The street fighter point holds up but sequels like sonic 2 include entirely new levels, assets, mechanics (the new special stages, the spindash, 2 player, vs mode, super sonic etc) are definitely more that what could be considered a "level pack". Sonic and knuckles on the other hand could be considered closer to that due to the situation of sonic 3 being split into 2 games due to a McDonalds promotion or something. Especially considering that a lot of assets for it were contained within sonic 3, such as the music and some unfinished zones. i do agree with @Sonicka in that i feel that the sonic 2>3k jump was bigger than the sonic 1>2 jump but sonic 2 was definitely more than a sonic 1 level pack. on the Mario side of things i would say that the japanese mario bros 2 could definitely have been considered a "level pack" to the point it was named "the lost levels" in the west. on the flipside we do have games like Majoras mask and Mario Galaxy 2 which were built off of previous games in the franchise and are considered fan favourites . but yeah, dev times were shorter back then just look at final fantasy, even ignoring the ones which went through Development hell the development times for the first few games were a lot quicker overall compared to how long something like FFXVI was in development.  @RainbowGazelle I don't know which one specifically is bothering them, but at one point in the game there's a mandatory pinball table with wonky, inconsistent ball physics, that is made worse by the fact it has no tilting to adjust the ball's direction, and insta-lose side pits. The required score to pass the table and continue to the rest of the game is quite high. Without tilting to prevent the instant losses that have zero user input, it pretty much comes down to pure luck on whether or not the score is met. For some players, that section might be over in a few minutes, and will be a fun little throwback. For the less fortunate, it can take an hour or longer. I really like pinball, in general, but that table was just painful to play. If they're adding new mechanics to the games in patches, fixing the pinball table by adding a tilt feature should be at the top of the list. From my perspective, that pinball table is the game's most glaring flaw, and it can actively prevent people from finishing the game. The other noteworthy "puzzle" that seems to trip up quite a few people is a late-game encounter with a mandatory, unavoidable enemy that causes instant death by drowning in the span of several seconds (encountered in the next zone shortly after the pinball table, so people might not be thinking clearly at the time, either). The first time you encounter it, it's also pretty far away from the previous checkpoint (so dying means a lot of back-tracking). Only one move will defeat it (down-stomping 3 times while inside it by pressing A while off the 'floor' and floating in the water), but the visual feedback the game provides really doesn't make it clear that's the correct/only way to defeat it, in comparison to other moves. Similarly to the infamous mandatory Sonic 3 carnival up/down pillar that doesn't behave like all the others, where moves other than the only correct one still give a visible reaction so people might experiment and keep trying things that simply won't work, it's trivial once you know how to pass it, but the visual feedback it provides is very misleading. Also, the way countering works in the game is kind of weird. Optimal countering/parrying in this game is holding down the counter button well before an attack occurs. No timing is needed. Timing things anyway works "okay" for most of the battles and puzzles...right up until fighting a certain Titan that has terrible visual feedback on when it will attack, and needs to be consecutively countered many times. There were some breaks in my playing through the game and I'd long forgotten timing was irrelevant in this game for counters from the early instructions where they briefly mention that tidbit, which is highly irregular when compared to other games, so it took me some time to get through that specific fight. From what I've seen online in discussions for the game, that isn't a unique experience.  @EarthboundBenjy to be fair all of the boost games dont have the spindash outside of classic sonic levels in gens and forces if i remember correctly. so the spindash will be something new to go along with the boost formula.  @Friscobay How exactly are challenge modes like mobile games?  Whaaa? What a time to be alive 🤯🤯  Waiting to play this has been beneficial, it seems.  @Orpheus79V I feel that challenges comes from this screen economy and screen time competition where the focus is no more on a game narrative but on a quick day to day identical sessions best suited for mobile devices. The idea is to keep you hooked. And monetize your screen time in continuity, adding nothing new to existing gameplay.  @Sonicka I don’t believe that quick mobile sessions and battle for your screen time is ultimately beneficial to the quality of the final product. Also it is about this stupid agile project management - this is why we never get I final debugged ready 2 go games anymore. This content is not free btw. It is a due content that was supposed to be the part of the final product. And you paid it quite generously when you bought an unfinished game for 59€.  @Matroska well then let’s call it as it is. Sonic is not a legacy quality franchise anymore. They lost it.  @Yannis it’s an agile management cycle. It’s allowing them to release an unfinished product. Legacy franchises like sonic should not be treated this way imho.  @Friscobay I’m not overly convinced an agile delivery was their original goal TBH. If Frontiers bombed it’s unlikely they would have continued adding this stuff (be it leftovers, planned, or new brand new content). And even if this was the case - generous isn’t a word I’d use for paying full price for Frontiers - I’d say “earned” is much closer. The game delivers a lot more content and a more worthwhile experience to me than most 3D Sonic’s have done in a very long time. I’m happy for once to have supported Sonic Team with this product and don’t regret my time or expense. I’m well aware of what happened during development to the islands, and that certain content got cut for time saving measures, but the game felt complete enough to me during my playthrough to warrant the price and gave me plenty to do. All the roadmap of extras (be it planed of unused content) I’ll happily take. It doesn’t need to justify the price point as far as I am concerned. If Sonic Team decided this was £9.99’s worth of content I’d still do happily pay because my experience with the base content was a positive one. Sorry you didn’t get a similar experience with this one. We can’t all enjoy the same things unfortunately.
