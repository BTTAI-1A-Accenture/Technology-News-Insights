                                                WHITEHALL TWP. - One of the nation’s most popular full-service restaurant chains is planning to slice into the Lehigh Valley’s dining scene. The Cheesecake Factory, known for its expansive menu of freshly prepared dishes and indulgent desserts, is planning to open its first Lehigh Valley restaurant at the Lehigh Valley Mall in Whitehall Township. Job listings for restaurant and kitchen managers have been posted for a location coming to 250 Lehigh Valley Mall in Whitehall on the chain’s website, but no other details have been announced. "NEW LOCATION OPENING!!" the job postings reads.  Lehigh Valley Mall A Cheesecake Factory spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking further information, including a tentative opening date or general time frame for when this location is expected to open. It’s also unclear what space the new restaurant will occupy at the mall. When informed about WFMZ readers’ inquiries regarding a possible Cheesecake Factory opening in Barnes & Noble’s original space near the mall's main entrance, Elizabeth DiDuca, the mall's director of marketing, provided the following response: "At this time, we cannot confirm plans for the Barnes & Nobles space,” DiDuca said in a written statement. “However, we'd be more than happy to share all the exciting movement and details upon confirmation." The Cheesecake Factory, which dubs itself “a leader in experiential dining,” features a menu of more than 250 dishes – freshly prepared and made from scratch daily – along with over 30 cheesecakes and desserts. Diners can enjoy small plates and snacks such as chicken taquitos, cheeseburger spring rolls and Korean fried cauliflower; appetizers such as avocado eggrolls, Thai lettuce wraps with chicken and pretzel bites with cheddar cheese fondue; sandwiches such as a Cuban, grilled chicken and avocado club and Renee’s chicken-almond salad sandwich; pastas such as cacio e pepe pasta, cajun jambalaya pasta and spicy rigatoni vodka; steaks such as grilled rib-eye, filet mignon and carne asada; and fish and seafood selections such as Jamaican black pepper shrimp, seared ahi tuna and miso salmon. About two dozen Cheesecake Factory specialties include chicken and biscuits, chicken parmesan “pizza style,” fish tacos, shepherd’s pie, Thai coconut-lime chicken, truffle-honey chicken and “Famous Factory Meatloaf.” Other menu highlights include salads, flatbread pizzas and “Glamburgers,” made with certified angus beef. Cheesecakes and specialty desserts include chocolate tower truffle cake, dulce de leche caramel cheesecake, mango Key lime cheesecake, Hershey’s chocolate bar cheesecake, Cinnabon cinnamon swirl cheesecake, coconut cream pie cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake, fresh banana cream cheesecake, pineapple upside-down cheesecake, strawberry shortcake and warm apple crisp, among others. On National Cheesecake Day, July 30, The Cheesecake Factory introduced its newest flavor: Cookie Dough Lover’s Cheesecake with Pecans.  For every slice of Cookie Dough Lover’s Cheesecake with Pecans sold through July 29, 2024, The Cheesecake Factory will donate 25 cents to Feeding America, a national hunger-relief organization dedicated to ending hunger through a network of food banks and meal programs. The Cheesecake Factory traces its origins back to the 1940s, when Evelyn Overton found a recipe in her local Detroit newspaper that inspired her Original Cheesecake, according to the restaurant’s website. The recipe was a huge hit, and Overton decided to open a small bakery in her basement kitchen and offer cakes to local restaurants, while raising her children, David and Renee. In 1972, Evelyn and her husband, Oscar, relocated to Los Angeles and opened The Cheesecake Factory Bakery, supplying her cheesecakes to restaurants throughout L.A. “In 1978, David was inspired to open a restaurant in Beverly Hills with his mother’s cakes showcased in the lobby and a made-from-scratch menu big enough to offer ‘something for everyone,’” the online description continues. “The restaurant was an immediate hit on opening day with a line out the door that many say has never stopped.” Today, more than 40,000 staff and managers provide upscale-casual dining experiences at over 200 locations worldwide, including other regional locations at King of Prussia Mall in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County; Willow Grove Mall in Abington Township, Montgomery County; and in Center City Philadelphia. In total, The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated owns and operates more than 321 restaurants under brands including The Cheesecake Factory, North Italia and a collection within its Fox Restaurant Concepts business. The Cheesecake Factory’s forthcoming Lehigh Valley location is welcome news for the Lehigh Valley Mall. In recent months, the mall welcomed two chains but it also bid farewell to some tenants. Face Foundrié, a chain of all-inclusive focused facial bars, opened July 21, in the mall’s outdoor lifestyle center, next to Warby Parker. Additionally, Kendra Scott, a lifestyle brand with gemstone-inspired collections that include fashion jewelry, fine jewelry, home goods and beauty, opened June 30 in the outdoor lifestyle center. Store closures in recent weeks include All Weather Selvedge, a business specializing in denim jeans made from proprietary Japanese selvedge fabrics; and Track 23, a fashion company offering modern men's and women's apparel and accessories for all seasons. Other Lehigh Valley Mall businesses are on the move. The Unique Boutique, a store carrying handmade gifts, home decor, personal care products and other items from more than 50 local vendors, held a grand opening in May in the mall's outdoor lifestyle center. The space previously housed Williams-Sonoma, a worldwide kitchenware, dinnerware and home furnishings retailer that closed its Whitehall location in January after 15 years of business. The Unique Boutique, formerly known as the Small Business Gallery, originally opened in November 2021 on the mall's lower level, near Macy's, owner Jennifer Smith said. The Unique Boutique, a store carrying handmade gifts, home decor, personal care products and other items from more than 50 local vendors, held a grand opening Saturday, May 6, at the Lehigh Valley Mall's outdoor lifestyle center in Whitehall Township.  Its move to the lifestyle center is temporary as Victoria's Secret has moved into The Unique Boutique's former storefront as renovations take place in the fashion retailer's original space. Smith anticipates moving The Unique Boutique back into its original space in early fall, "probably in October," she said. "It's really great to see the store doing so well and the community continuing to support these small businesses," Smith said. "When I first opened the storefront in late 2021, it was only supposed to be for two months during the holidays, but I decided to keep it going year-round because it did so well." Victoria's Secret, the longtime retailer known for its signature bras, panties, lingerie, sleepwear and athleisure and swim apparel, is expected to move back into its original lower-level space (a few doors down from its temporary location) following the completion of renovations in late summer, manager Julia Malave said. The transition will include Pink - Victoria's Secret's sister brand - moving across the hallway from its current location to part of the redesigned space next to Victoria's Secret, Malave said. To allow for Pink's upcoming relocation, Blue Monkey Vapes - a store selling e-liquids and vaping devices and accessories - recently moved to the mall's second-level space that was previously home to Things Remembered, which closed earlier this year. Blue Monkey had been in its lower-level space for about four years and before that, it operated as a mall kiosk for another four years, store associate Chris Naegel said. Blue Monkey, with roughly two dozen locations in several states, offers hundreds of flavors of e-liquids. Popular brands include Hi Drip, Bad Drip, Sad Boy and Juice Head. In its new, second-level space, Blue Monkey expanded its merchandise mix to include candy, chips and other snacks. Also on the move at the Lehigh Valley Mall is Cloud City, which moved this past week from its roughly year-old spot on the mall's second level (former Disney Store space) to a newly renovated, second-level spot near Macy's. The store's new location previously housed VR Cafe, an entertainment facility offering virtual reality gaming options, which closed in April. At its new location, Cloud City - which buys, sells and trades games, comics, toys and collectibles - has about 800 square feet of additional floor space for its retail displays as well as tournaments and other organized play events for Yu-Gi-Oh!, Dungeons & Dragons and other games, an owner said. Cloud City was established in 2013 and previously had a couple of Emmaus area stores before moving its Lehigh County operations to Whitehall last year. A second location of the business opened at the Palmer Park Mall in April 2021. Finally, Barnes & Noble, the largest retail bookseller in the United States with roughly 600 stores across the country, temporarily closed its Lehigh Valley Mall store last month, before a temporary store opens in the fall in the former Tracker 23 space. Following the temporary store location, the bookseller expects to then reopen in its original, lower-level space near the mall's main entrance next year. "Our temporary bookstore will be located just a few hundred yards away and is expected to open in early October," a post on the store's Facebook page reads. "Our last day before we start our redesign will be Sunday July 23, 2023, with plans to reopen in the same space in 2024." "This move offers us a huge opportunity to feature our stunning new store design and revamped B&N Café. Our shelves will be stocked with all the bestsellers and hidden gems you know and love - our world-class book selection, the best toys and games, expansive vinyl collection and more." All of these transitions follow other recent Lehigh Valley Mall moves, including wireless carrier T-Mobile, which moved from its lower-level spot near Boscov's to a larger lower-level space between Better Life with Bry and L'amour; toy store Toys Toys, which moved from its lower-level space near the mall's main entrance to T-Mobile's former lower-level space; and Pepper Palace, a retail chain selling all-natural hot sauces, barbecue sauces, wing sauces, salsas, seasonings and dry rubs, which relocated from the mall's outdoor lifestyle center to an interior space on the first level, between Verizon and Hamsa Exoticz. The departures of All Weather Selvedge and Track 23 follow a string of other closures at the mall over the past year.  Retailers that left the mall in the winter and spring include Things Remembered, a retailer of personalized gifts; Country Memories, a store selling country collectibles, gifts and home decor; VR Cafe, a "modern-aged arcade" offering virtual reality gaming; and Vera Bradley, a designer of women’s handbags, backpacks, tote bags, luggage, fashion and home accessories and unique gifts.  A couple of other storefront vacancies have also popped up in recent months. First, Time After Time, a store offering sales of watches and watch accessories along with watch repair, has closed on the lower level near Swarovski Crystal. Second, T-Mobile, offering a variety of wireless plans, cell phones and accessories, recently closed on the mall's upper level near Claire's Accessories. T-Mobile continues to operate a location on the mall's lower level. Other mall vacancies include the former Bravo!, Almost Vegan and Ruby Tuesday spaces.  BETHLEHEM, Pa. - A popular Carbon County doughnut shop - dishing out unique varieties like caramel churro, Nutella maple bacon and pistachio raspberry cheesecake – is almost ready to welcome customers at its second regional location.
