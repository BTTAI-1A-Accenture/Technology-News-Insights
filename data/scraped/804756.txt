WATCH LIVE WEST COVINA, Calif. (KABC) -- The driver of a stolen Toyota Camry led police on a wild and dangerous chase through the streets of the San Gabriel Valley Wednesday night. The pursuit started around 8:30 p.m. when officers tried to pull over the reported-stolen vehicle in West Covina. The driver took off, staying on surface streets but driving wildly at times, making erratic left turns through red lights and swerving across lanes in efforts to get away. Officers tried several times to approach the vehicle closely in apparent efforts to make a PIT maneuver but each time the car sped up and the attempt was not made.
