Advanced Search In total, the company was cited for two repeat violations and one serious violation.  An inspection at a popular discount retail store in the U.S. found conditions that exposed workers to various hazards. Now, the company is facing citations and penalties. According to a news release and citations, OSHA inspected a TJ Maxx store, operated by TJX Companies Inc., in Pooler, Georgia, and found extra boxes and trash, due to a broken compactor, in a “storage and receiving room,” items deemed “unstable” and exit routes that were not cleared, exposing workers to slip, trip and fall, struck-by, fire and entrapment hazards. OSHA cited TJX Companies Inc., which operates numerous other department stores including Marshalls and HomeSense, for two repeat violations and one serious violation and proposed penalties of $239,290. "The U.S. Department of Labor will not allow employers like TJX Companies Inc. to put their workers at risk by repeatedly violating federal safety standards," said OSHA Acting Area Office Director Jerred Stevens in Savannah in the news release. "These standards exist to protect workers from needless harm during their routine workday, especially in an emergency. The hazards often found in busy retail stores are easily addressed but, left ignored, they can jeopardize workers,” Stevens continued.
