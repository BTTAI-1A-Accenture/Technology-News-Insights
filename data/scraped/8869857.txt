					Philippines' Technology News and Reviews				 Do you use GCash’s GCredit or GGives as a mode of payment for your Shopee transactions? Well, we got some bad news. GCash GCredit and GGives allowed Filipinos to purchase and pay for services in case of emergencies and they are yet to have cash on hand. A lot of people use them for online transactions in Shopee, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in the Philippines. But in a new advisory that we received from GCash via SMS, Shopee will no longer accept GGives and GCredit as payment options starting April 30, 2023.

However, Shopee recently increased its handling fee on GCash payments to 2%. Dropping GCash’s financing services could be Shopee’s way to promote their own. In lieu of the said services, Shopee patrons can use SPayLater instead. Your email address will not be published.
