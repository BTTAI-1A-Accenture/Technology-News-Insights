SENATOR Jinggoy Estrada has filed a resolution seeking the establishment of mental health offices (MHOs) in state universities and colleges in the country in the wake of “rising incidence” of Filipino students struggling with mental health issues.He said the establishment of MHOs is aimed at ensuring an easy access to mental health care not only of the students but also of the faculty members, teachers and non-teaching personnel of the school.Estrada cited the World Health Organization (WHO) report on adolescent mental health, which showed suicide as the fourth leading cause of death among adolescents aged 15 to 29.In the same report, the body said that consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults."There have been a lot of studies that have come out on the worsening mental shape of our youth today. Hindi dapat natin itong ipagwalang bahala. Dapat aksyunan ito at solusyunan. Mahalagang pagtuunan ito ng pansin nang hindi na madagdagan pa ang ating mga mag-aaral na depressed (We should not ignore this. It must be acted upon and resolved. It is important to focus on this so that the number of depressed students will not increase)," Estrada said.Aside from establishing MHOs in campuses, the lawmaker also proposed setting up campus hotlines with dedicated and trained guidance counselors to provide assistance to students and teaching and non-teaching staff.Estrada said special attention shall be given to those identified to have mental health problems or conditions, especially those at risk of committing suicide.Heightened campaign is likewise mandated to raise the collective consciousness about mental health, with special emphasis to issues of suicide prevention, stress handling, mental health and nutrition, guidance and counselling.Estrada said this is to ensure that the whole state university or college community, especially the students, is aware of in-campus mental health services.Meanwhile, Senator Francis Escudero has called on the Department of Health (DOH) to lead a nationwide study that will enable the government to get a bigger picture of the current mental health state of Filipinos, especially amid the “alarming” reports of suicide cases among students.He said a comprehensive study is needed to have a holistic and effective approach in addressing the problem in general, noting it will also serve as a supplemental to the recent survey conducted by the Department of Education (DepEd) on the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in the mental health of elementary and high school students."Hindi sapat ang mga datos na ating nalaman. Ito ang aking panawagan, marapat na tingnan ng DOH ang kasalukuyang mental health situation sa ating bansa, hindi lamang sa mga mag-aaral – elementary, high school o college," Escudero, chairman of the Senate Committee on Higher, Technical and Vocational Education, said.(The data we know is not enough. This is my appeal, the DOH should look at the current mental health situation in our country, not only among students – elementary, high school or college.)"Dapat na maisama sa pag-aaral pati na mga ordinaryong mga Pilipino mula sa iba't ibang sektor, nagtatrabaho o walang trabaho. Mahalagang makuha ang mga datos na iyan para malaman natin kung papaano natin gagawan ng remedyo o solusyon ang problemang ito," he added.(Ordinary Filipinos from various sectors, working or unemployed, should also be included in the study. It is important to get that data so that we know how we can make a remedy or solution to this problem.)Escudero reiterated the need to promote mental health and wellness that is strongly supported by the government due to the alarming rise in mental health-related cases in the country.
