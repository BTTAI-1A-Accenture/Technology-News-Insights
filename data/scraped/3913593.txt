 The Lake Land College Board of Trustees has approved an agreement with the college architect for work related to the former Patterson Technology building in Effingham. The college purchased the building earlier this year. The firm, Bailey Edward of Champaign, will be paid $171,100 for planning the remodel of what will now be known as the Effingham Technology Center. The work will involve the planning for the classes now housed in the Lake Land Kluthe Center for Higher Education and Technology and for the Effingham Regional Career Academy. College officials say the priority remains to have the facility ready for use Fall 2024.  The college also plans to retain the Kluthe Center building, but plans remain open as to how the building will be utilized once the move to the Technology Center takes place.  Also at this week's meeting, Lake Land trustees approved 5% base salary increases for the college's administrators, supervisors and support staff, plus $1,500. The Board also approved a 4% increase in the base salary schedule, approved 5% hourly increases for part-time staff, as well as part-time rates and stipends for the coming fiscal year. © Copyright 2019 Premier Broadcasting.
