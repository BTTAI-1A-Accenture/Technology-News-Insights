DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The "Targeted Sequencing Market - A Global and Regional Analysis: Focus on Product Type, Target Enrichment Method, Type of Target Capture, Application, End User, and Region Analysis - Analysis and Forecast, 2022-2032" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.
 
The global targeted sequencing market is projected to reach $10,976.1 million by 2032 from $3,198.8 million in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 13.12% during the forecast period 2022-2032.
 
The growth in the global targeted sequencing market is expected to be driven by the increased use of targeted sequencing in clinical laboratories and diagnostic applications, especially in cancer research.
 
Targeted sequencing is a cost-effective and rapid way to detect novel and known variants in selected genetic or genomic regions. There are several different methods of DNA/RNA sequencing depending on the scale of the region being sequenced.
 
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is the most used method for targeted sequencing, which offers good scalability, speed, and resolution to evaluate the targeted regions of interest. Other methods include sanger sequencing and CRISPR.
 
The major advantage of targeted sequencing as compared to whole genome sequencing is the smaller and more manageable data sets created, which are significantly easier to analyze.
 
Targeted next-generation sequencing focuses on specific genomic areas of interest, which is ideal for examining specific pathways or targeted resequencing. Furthermore, it is more rapid and cost-effective as compared to whole genome sequencing and allows deeper sequencing. This is a powerful and especially sensitive method of identifying gene mutations and variants, including rare variants.
