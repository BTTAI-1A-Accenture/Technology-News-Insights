		 Farmers provides home insurance in 44 states, but recently announced it would no longer be selling new home insurance policies in Florida. The company maintains a very low level of customer complaints but its home insurance costs more than the national average. Read this Farmers home insurance review to find out if it’s right for you. Pros Cons Why trust our home insurance experts Our team of experts evaluates hundreds of insurance products and analyzes thousands of data points to help you find the best product for your situation. We use a data-driven methodology to determine each rating. Advertisers do not influence our editorial content. You can read more about our methodology below. As its name suggests, Farmers Insurance started with the goal of providing auto insurance to farmers and ranchers. Recognizing these rural drivers offered a lower risk than urban motorists, founders John Tyler and Thomas Leavey set up their company in 1928 and began traveling from farm to farm selling policies. Today, customers can select from nearly 50,000 regional agents to work with and find an insurance policy that works for them. Here are average annual Farmers home insurance costs for different dwelling coverage amounts in comparison to the national average.  Farmers sells HO-3 home insurance policies — the most common type of home insurance — that includes the following coverages:  A standard home insurance policy from Farmers provides “all risks” coverage for the structure of your house and its attached structures. This means Farmers will reimburse you for repairs to damage caused by anything except problems that are excluded from your policy, such as flood damage and earthquake damage.  If you have a standard HO-3 home insurance policy, it also covers your belongings, but only if they’re damaged by a problem specifically listed in your policy. This is called “named perils” coverage. Farmers HO-3 policies will pay to repair your belongings if they are damaged by one of the below 16 named perils, or problems.  Want to know more about coverage? What homeowners insurance covers  There are several issues that home insurance won’t cover. Some common ones include:  Home insurance won’t cover every problem that can arise. Farmers offers several coverages that you can add on to your home insurance policy.  Keep in mind adding coverage may increase the cost of your home insurance, but also offers more financial protection. Coverage offerings may vary by location but can include the following.  Farmers does not offer the cheapest home insurance, but does provide a significant number of discounts that can help lower your premium if you decide to go with this company. Discounts include the following. A very low rate of complaints have been lodged against Farmers, according to data collected from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This suggests customers maintain a largely favorable view of Farmers. Complaints against insurers typically include claim delays, denials and settlements.
