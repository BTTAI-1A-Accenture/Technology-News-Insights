 I’ve frequently used Google Voice for professional purposes, and it is an excellent option for small business owners who want a simple and easy way to communicate with peers, vendors or customers. Google Voice does have cost-friendly premium plans if customers try out the free version and decide it’s a good fit. David Idle, CPO of Bigleaf Networks, a leading provider of network optimization solutions, shared his thoughts on Google Voice: “I like its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with Google Workspace, but I dislike its limited feature set compared to enterprise-grade solutions. My overall view is that it’s ideal for smaller organizations seeking a simple, cost-effective solution.” Google Voice gave me a free local number upon signup, which I ported to my personal number. Please note that you need an existing phone number to use Voice. There can be a slight delay when receiving calls as you have to press a button to confirm you accept the call; if you are not fast enough, the call might not go through and your caller will be sent to voicemail. This detail can be frustrating as it could potentially result in lost business opportunities. Other features include call forwarding and voicemail transcription. Customers within the U.S. get unlimited texting, which is very convenient for situations where you need to connect with someone but cannot place calls. In my experience, Voice had no direct add-ons to take advantage of. I will say that as it is part of the Google suite of products, it is very easy to link it to other cloud communication tools such as Meet or Chat, each of which is also free, so it’s a great way for a small team to set up a no-cost all-in-one collaboration hub. It may be possible to add a SIP Link subscription, but this option is only available in specific countries that lack first-party calling capabilities. You can technically include Voice as an add-on by signing up for a GoogleWorkspace account. When looking at Google Voice reviews online, it’s clear that satisfied customers appreciated the quality of calls, mentioning that the phone service is strong, especially for the price. Some also appreciated the ability to easily port their personal numbers to a local professional number and, therefore, avoid buying a second phone or signing up for a separate phone service. Others liked the ability to make calls from their PC without relying solely on their phones. While porting may be a convenient option, some customers did not like that it was mandatory, comparing it to competitors that assign a number and do not require you to have an existing phone service. Others would prefer to receive notifications on their PCs and wonder why this is unavailable. Criticisms aside, Voice proves due to the global reach of the Google brand and its affordable pricing. Most users seem to appreciate the service, even with its flaws. Google Voice is free, meaning a sole proprietor or tiny business team could get away with setting up a Voice account and spending their money elsewhere. Premium Voice plans start at $10 per month; this makes Google Voice among the most cost-effective VoIP solutions. While Google Voice is available for download to iOS and Android-capable devices, there is no desktop app. I was able to use Voice through my phone and a web browser with relative ease. I find that support for Google Voice is not as straightforward as it could be. When you click on the “Help” function within the app, you can search through Google’s support page library. In my experience, the closest you get to live assistance is through the community forum, where you briefly describe your problem and hope that board members or a moderator can provide the answer you are looking for. Google’s customer support is perhaps its weakest attribute, although the service is straightforward enough that you might not need live assistance in the same way that you might with another VoIP service. That said, if reliable customer support is a major concern, Google Voice might not be a good fit. Learn more: Read our Google Voice review. Who should use it: Any small to midsize business owner looking to scale beyond the Google Voice freeware model. See MoreSee Less Pricing from  $20 per user per month if paid annually

 I was very impressed with RingCentral’s quality of calling service and the ease with which I could coordinate communication across channels, shifting from voice and text to chat and video conferencing. Moreover, RingCentral offers hundreds of third-party integrations, further strengthening one’s ability to create a truly comprehensive VoIP experience. Bob Mesas, Vice President of Sales for Central Business Systems, also noted RingCentral’s robust service: “RingCentral is probably the most refined VoIP application on the market in terms of the features it offers. You can put it on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. It also integrates with Microsoft Teams directly, and there are a lot of different plugins for CRM applications, such as Salesforce.com. If you are working in Salesforce, you can dial right out of Salesforce into RingCentral with the click of a button. It’s a very scalable solution, whether you have a couple of people or hundreds or thousands. It’s a little pricier than some of the others, but I think RingCentral more than makes up for it in features and support.” RingCentral offers local and toll-free business numbers at sign-up and unlimited calling across the United States and Canada. When testing the service, I found the audio to be high-quality; this was also true when I later used RingCentral’s video conferencing software. Some other features include carrier-compliant multimedia messaging service (MMS) and short messaging service (SMS). I received frequent reminders to register with The Campaign Registry (TCR), a sign that RingCentral takes carrier compliance seriously and is working toward messaging transparency. Other useful features include interactive voice response (IVR), advanced call handling features such as whisper or barge, and internet faxing. While the entry-level Essentials plan comes with most of the features necessary for a decent VoIP service experience, some features like call recording and third-party apps such as Canva or Smarsh require a higher plan to gain access. In testing RingCentral, I primarily focused on the standard features of my chosen plan. That said, RingCentral offers several add-on features to further expand your business’s communication experiences. For voice, get a free phone or non-geo number starting at $19.99 per month. You can add unlimited outbound minutes to your service for $10 per month per user, which is very convenient for companies that expect to place many calls in any given month. RingCentral Webinar starts at $63 monthly per host and comes with a free trial for new subscribers, which lets you get the most out of the service without immediately committing to the add-on. Licenses, such as for push-to-talk, start at $7 per month. RingCentral is an extremely popular VoIP service, with thousands of customer comments across various websites. Satisfied customers appreciate the wide range of call, text, chat and video features. Their feedback largely aligned with my own experience using the service. Additionally, the satisfied customers mentioned that RingCentral saved them money, and they found it to be a very convenient all-in-one platform. Meanwhile, the negative feedback from customers repeatedly mentioned their unpleasant support experiences. For instance, some mentioned a lack of available agents or inconsistent communication. Compared to other VoIP service providers, RingCentral’s $20 per month starting price is more expensive than some. For instance, both Google Voice and Zoom have free plans as well as premium plans that start at $10. However, RingCentral offers more comprehensive features and the potential to incorporate hundreds of third-party apps into your service experience. The range of features, I think, could ultimately make it good value for money, and if your company has the budget, RingCentral is worth consideration. When testing RingCentral, I downloaded the apps for mobile and desktop use. In my experience, the app functioned uniformly across all platforms; I was able to start communication on my laptop and continue on my smartphone without missing a beat. I think this level of flexibility is very convenient for situations where you begin communicating on one device but need to resume a call or chat on another. I am not sure it’s fair to say that RingCentral has 24/7 support—unless you count an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot as an agent. While the chatbot is perpetually available, in my experience, it did not always provide the exact information I needed. I also found that it difficult to connect to a live support agent. RingCentral is best for businesses that need a comprehensive VoIP solution with robust features. Learn more: Read our full RingCentral review.

 I appreciated how seamlessly Dialpad blends AI into its service features. For instance, it offers real-time transcription and time-saving call and meeting synopses. These resources blend well with the rest of Diapad’s flexible cloud communication offerings. Jason Elliott, Owner of Elliot System Partners, which specializes in consulting businesses on phone systems and contact centers, shared his thoughts with us: “Dialpad stands out as a highly technologically advanced phone system solution. The company embarked on the development of their proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) technology several years ago, well ahead of the prevailing trend. This strategic decision has endowed Dialpad with a heightened level of security, surpassing that of most of their competitors. Dialpad also boasts an extensive array of native integrations specifically tailored for CRMs, facilitating a streamlined and enhanced work environment for the employees, resulting in better experiences for the customers.” I tested Dialpad’s calling and voice conferencing tools and appreciated the number-forwarding feature, which helped avoid missed calls and ensured that the calls I sent went to the correct person. The call and video quality were good, and I found the software interface modern and attractive. Dialpad provides unlimited domestic calling, business texting, visual voicemail, custom call routing and more. As the service plan I tested came with a local business number, I did not need to add one on However, if your business needs additional local, toll-free or international phone numbers, they are available starting at $5 per month. You also have the option to buy a line for internet faxing. If you want a special conference line, the price is $15 monthly. While I could not find as many add-ons for Dialpad as some competing VoIP providers, I think the existing options are reasonably priced. Dialpad is another very popular VoIP provider, and there are hundreds of customer reviews detailing past and present experiences with the company. Satisfied customers describe Dialpad as a reasonably priced service with great features. Customers enjoyed the AI components, flexibility in day-to-day communication, and the ability to send and receive calls through PC and mobile devices. Some also appreciated Dialpad’s scalability. Meanwhile, less enthused customers cited call issues and language translation inaccuracies. There were also multiple concerns centered around a lack of billing transparency. In a few cases, customers mentioned they had difficulty canceling their service. With a starting price of $15 per month, paid annually, it’s worth it for most small businesses to spend this much. Though Dialpad’s Standard and Pro tier prices are publicly available, if you would prefer the Enterprise plan, you must contact the sales team for a quote. Dialpad has apps for both desktop and mobile, and I tested both. I appreciated how easy it was to communicate by voice or video across multiple devices. Dialpad’s apps are compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems and iOS and Android smart devices. As part of my review process, I contacted Dialpad’s support team to get a better idea of what the customer service experience would be. I reached out with a question about a call feature to see how the agent would handle my concern. The team member was professional and thorough in their assistance, addressing my question completely. While this was my experience, I must note it may not be the case for everyone as certain support options might not be available according to your specific service plan. I also found that Dialpad’s AI bot, while useful for straightforward issues, might not be as helpful for specific problems that ultimately require a human support team member. Dialpad is best for businesses that need a comprehensive VoIP solution with excellent integrations and AI. Learn more: Read our full Dialpad review.

 Intermedia Unite offers a wide range of useful features and transparent pricing. It makes our list because I think it is the best all-in-one Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solution, meaning it’s a cloud delivery model that combines tools like chat, video conferencing, call and file sharing into a single platform. David Idle, CPO of Bigleaf Networks, a leading provider of network optimization solutions, also likes Intermedia United: “It has reliable performance, making it a robust unified communications platform. Pricing may be higher compared to some competitors, but it’s a solid choice for industries prioritizing reliability and security.” I tested Intermedia Unite’s multiple communication channels across desktop and mobile devices, including voice, video and chat. The call quality was decent, though the other party noted some slight static. In addition to unlimited calling, Intermedia provides businesses with cloud-based phone systems, video or audio conferencing with real-time screen sharing, internet faxing, and voicemail to email. Overall, Intermedia Unite impressed me with its straightforward approach to UCaaS service features and pricing. You know exactly what you are getting with each plan. However, I think it’s a bad call to force customers to pay more for video meetings when many competitors offer it as standard, if not free. You must also upgrade to have conferencing for a maximum of 200 participants or access to third-party apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, NetSuite and Microsoft Dynamics. I tested the main plan features available to Intermedia Unite, but noted several useful add-ons for businesses. A fax line costs $12.99 per month, exchange emails are priced at $7.49 monthly and resource lines cost as low as $9.99 per month. Some additional features, such as Unite Archiving or an extra phone line, require contacting the sales team for a quote. Intermedia also has a specific solution that combines Unite for Communications with Microsoft Teams, which starts at $15.99 per month. This add-on includes basic private branch exchange (PBX), E911, contact sync and more. Intermedia has had decades to build its reputation as a communications service provider, garnering positive feedback in recent years. Satisfied customers had good experiences using the service and praised Intermedia’s straightforward pricing. The negative customer reviews referred to minor issues such as language barriers and the inability to deal with email spam. There was also mention of poor reception while traveling. While I appreciated the simplicity of Intermedia’s two plans, a starting cost of $27.99 per month makes it among the most expensive VoIP services. There are many alternatives that offer discounts for annual agreements or cost less outright month-to-month. Still, I think its features and its ability to function as a convenient all-in-one communications hub may make it a good value for the money for some businesses. I downloaded and tested Unite on both desktop and mobile devices. Its apps are compatible with Windows and Apple computers or iOS and Android smartphones. In my experience, customer support was very helpful and professional in offering assistance. There was a short wait over the phone and I connected with a team member after around 20 seconds. I also received a prompt email response to my service issue. Learn more: Read our Intermedia Unite review. Who should use it: Intermedia Unite’s pricing plans and features work best for medium to large businesses.

 Nextiva was easy to get started. The setup process was quick and it only took a few moments for me to download the NextivaONE app to desktop and mobile devices. It was relatively easy to add users to the account, place calls and create a custom phone system. The overall ease of experience will vary depending on your VoIP experience, but I consider Nextiva a great starting point for most potential customers. Nextiva has unlimited voice, video calling, voicemail, and internet faxing capabilities. Customers get toll-free numbers for no added charge. By upgrading, you can access unlimited conference calls with potentially limitless participants and features, such as screen sharing, voicemail transcription, and an auto-attendant. I experienced good visual and sound quality for calls and video meetings. One feature I found especially useful was Acoustic Echo Cancellation; this tool eliminates echoes during calls, which can be useful when multiple devices near each other are on the same call. While Nextiva provides third-party integrations, I found you must upgrade for access, as its most standard tier links almost exclusively with Microsoft Outlook and Google Contacts. Alex Aristides, a VoIP expert and our advisory board member, adds: “This company has a great all in one package, but lacks many voice features and easy use in comparisons to the other companies here.” Nextiva’s vFAX starts at $7.95 per month for 500 pages and is a great option for businesses that want an affordable online fax tool. Not only does it add another communication channel, but a HIPAA-friendly version is available for healthcare companies. Nextiva is a popular VoIP provider with mostly positive reviews from customers. Users consider its software easy to use. References to the support team were mixed, with some claiming to have good experiences with sales and support agents, while others were frustrated. One area that concerned me was the claims of having difficulty canceling service. Nextiva’s starting price of $20 per user per month if billed annually. I think Nextiva is designed for scalability, but budget-wise, it is best-suited for medium to large organizations. Very tiny companies should consider Google Voice or Grasshopper as cost-friendly alternatives. Nextiva’s app, NextivaONE, is compatible with Windows, Mac/iOS and Android devices. While there is some flexibility in accessing NextivaONE by phone or computer, it is crucial to note that your experience will vary. For instance, while I could easily log into the NextivaONE app through my web browser, the app would sometimes lag when loading or, in some cases, get caught in a log-in loop where you are directed back and forth between the app and mobile website. I did not directly engage Nextiva’s customer service while testing the product. However, I did note that it offers 24/7 support uniformly across all plans. This means no matter which tier you commit to, you should expect to be able to reach a live agent. Being able to connect with Nextiva support by phone, email, and chat is helpful and makes the service stand apart from many competitors that charge extra for live agent access. Nextiva is best for mid to large businesses that need a comprehensive VoIP solution with an easy-to-use interface. Learn more: Read our full Nextiva review.

 While some VoIP services shift their focus to larger, enterprise-level companies, I appreciate that Grasshopper continues to prioritize sole proprietors and small businesses. If you are new to VoIP as a small business owner and want a fast and efficient way to create a simple phone system, Grasshopper is a great choice. Jason Elliott, Owner of Elliot System Partners, which specializes in consulting businesses on phone systems and contact centers, shared his thoughts with us: “Grasshopper is a distinctive and cost-effective solution tailored specifically for small businesses, particularly startups. It boasts a simple, user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless navigation. The streamlined call-forwarding functionality enables the elimination of app downloads unless the need arises to engage in text-based communication through the Grasshopper business number. Furthermore, incoming voicemails can be conveniently emailed, thereby obviating the necessity for callers to leave messages on personal mobile devices.” Grasshopper comes with unlimited domestic calling, business texting and the ability to switch between VoIP and Wi-Fi calling. I tested these features and found that Grasshopper provided adequate call quality, though the sound was slightly fuzzy. Plans come with your choice of a local or toll-free business number, though you will need to port it to an existing number. An especially useful feature I was impressed with is instant response; the tool lets you automatically send out a text message in the event of a missed call. When testing Grasshopper, I used the business number that came with the account. Most plans only come with a single phone number, but you can get an additional number for $9 per month. As for international calling, it is available, although not included as unlimited minutes in your service plan. You must reach out to Grasshopper’s support team to enable it. Grasshopper is a popular VoIP option among individuals and small business owners. Satisfied customers frequently mentioned that they enjoyed how simple and easy the service is while providing everything necessary to support a virtual business operation or remote work. They also enjoy its convenience and mention that it is priced fairly. Some customers had issues with poor call quality. I also noted a few Grasshopper customers found it difficult to connect with live agents. Grasshopper starts at $14 monthly with an annual agreement. Its plans are priced to suit solopreneurs, startups and very small businesses. If you are looking for an easy way to set up a professional contact with a simple phone system, Grasshopper represents an affordable option with decent value for money. Grasshopper has both desktop and mobile apps. When you create an account, Grasshopper will link your personal number to your new business number, after which you may make calls using the desktop or mobile app. Grasshopper apps are compatible with Windows and Mac for desktop and with Apple and Android-capable smartphones. I tested Grasshopper using both a laptop and phone and found it worked perfectly fine across both devices. In my experience, getting the right assistance through Grasshopper’s customer service can be a bit of a lengthy process. It requires accessing a help article most relevant to your issue. If the article does not solve your problem, you are directed to click the “Contact Us” link, after which you will be given a case number. You can opt to skip certain steps by contacting the toll-free support number. When I called, I was connected to a support team member within seconds. Grasshopper is best for small businesses and solopreneurs who need a basic VoIP solution with features such as call forwarding and extensions. Learn more: Read our full Grasshopper review.

 Out of all the services I’ve reviewed, I believe Zoom Phone is one of the better-priced VoIP options, making it an ideal choice for small businesses operating on a tight budget. Although it is affordably priced, some customers might feel the call quality could be better. David Idle, CPO of Bigleaf Networks, a leading provider of network optimization solutions, chimed in on Zoom Phone: “It has seamless integration with Zoom’s video conferencing platform. But it’s relatively new to the market, so it may lack some advanced features. I think it’s best suited for businesses already utilizing Zoom for collaboration needs.” To get the most out of the testing experience, I signed up for the US & Canada Unlimited plan, which starts at $15 per month. The Metered plan starts lower at $10 monthly; however, there are fees when making outbound calls. In addition to video conferencing support, Zoom Phone has contact center features, such as call whispering, monitoring, barge and takeover; it also has call recording. From my experience, Zoom’s call quality was inconsistent. On the one hand, I could hear the other party very well. However, when calling out, the receiver sometimes found it hard to understand me. I noted a distinct drop in audio quality for the other party when calling through Zoom versus placing a regular call. When testing Zoom Phone, I used a domestic number to place calls. It was very easy for me to get a toll-free number, as they start at just $5 per month. Zoom also offers local and international numbers, which cost as low as $5 monthly. There is a special international calling add-on that runs $120 per year. If you want to add premier developer support or a virtual workspace reservation, you have to contact Zoom’s sales team to get a quote. Zoom continues to enjoy a largely positive reputation among VoIP or video conferencing customers in the post-pandemic era, indicating that it remains a leader in the cloud communication industry. Customers have good things to say about Zoom’s call quality. They also like the available integrations and feel the service is very easy to use, especially if you’re already familiar with digital voice and video meetings. A few customers felt the interface was a bit clunky and not as visually appealing as some alternatives. Meanwhile, some customers experienced a slight learning curve as they were new to Zoom. Connection quality was reportedly an issue, which I think suggests Zoom may not be the best choice for anyone without a stable high-speed internet connection. As Zoom starts at $10 per month or $120 per year, it is among the best-priced VoIP services on the market. While there are no discounts when switching between monthly and annual contracts, Zoom Phone’s pricing was among the most straightforward of VoIP services I reviewed. If you want fair upfront pricing, Zoom could be a great fit. Zoom has apps downloadable to desktop and mobile devices, compatible with Windows and Mac on PCs or iOS and Android on phones and tablets. I appreciated the ability to use Zoom to place calls through laptops or smartphones; I only wish that the call quality could have been a little better. I reached out to Zoom’s support team for help with my account. While my own experience was positive and the agent was knowledgeable and polite, the ability to connect with a member of the support team readily could vary based on your service plan. Zoom does offer 24/7 support to standalone Phone customers. Solo entrepreneurs and very small teams operating on a tight budget. Learn more: Read our full Zoom Phone review.

 8×8 is a VoIP and UCaaS solution that I strongly recommend for businesses wanting access to a wide range of contact center tools. At the time I reviewed it, I thought of it as a scalable provider that could fit the needs and budgets of most businesses; however, recent changes to its plan structure could make it a better fit for enterprise-level companies. Although I was able to get the most out of the service during testing, it was not exactly a smooth signup process and there could be a slight learning curve for those new to UCaaS and VoIP. Joel Wolfe, President and founder of HiredSupport, used 8×8 for his company: “I found 8×8 to be a good option when interacting with my marketing department. There was no need to switch platforms, as an in-app feature helped us to communicate seamlessly. It has excellent call quality; there was no background noise during the call, even though I was stuck in traffic.” 8×8’s services span unified communication and contact center capabilities. I directly tested its voice, business chat and video conferencing features and appreciated its high-quality visual and sound components. I was especially impressed with the ability to livestream meetings on YouTube, which can help organizations reach a much wider audience than standard conferencing tools. Other service plan features include SMS and MMS, virtual faxing and integration with popular third-party apps like 8×8’s services span unified communication and contact center capabilities. During the testing process, I had access to “hot” storage, which lets you store data for up to 130 days. However, some businesses need to hold data for a much longer period. In that case, I recommend 8×8’s cold storage add-on; it lets you archive or retrieve items for up to 10 years. Another noteworthy added feature is Secure Pay, which offers the safe processing of customer payments. Intelligent Customer Assistant is an AI tool that lets you provide self-help services to your customers, which could be very useful to very small teams that lack a robust customer support team. 8×8 is one of the more established UCaaS providers, having serviced businesses of all sizes for decades. The feedback I found was largely positive, with customers mentioning 8×8’s excellent call quality and plan features. There was also praise for 8×8’s customer support and how agents assisted in navigating any issues as they arose, as it matched my own experience. There has been a recent shift in feelings regarding 8×8, particularly whether it is a good fit for smaller businesses. A growing number of customers feel that 8×8’s focus is primarily on enterprise-level companies, with some expressing frustration over transparency in pricing and plan details. I noted that 8×8 no longer has public pricing for any of its service plans. Although multiple service tiers are available, potential customers must contact 8×8’s sales team for a quote. In recent years, the brand has moved toward a business model that favors larger businesses, so its pricing and plan structure will likely not suit small businesses that prefer a budget-friendly VoIP service. 8×8 offers both desktop and mobile apps for download. I was able to test the mobile app 8×8 Work, which supports voice, messaging, voicemail, call recording, and parked call features. 8×8 Work is also available for desktop and offers similar functionality, making it possible to call, text, or chat across multiple devices. In my experience, 8×8 customer support was very knowledgeable and helpful. It was fast, efficient and among the most positive experiences when testing customer support for VoIP services. When seeking assistance, I was able to connect with 8×8 support over the phone and also through chat. 8×8 is best for medium to enterprise-level businesses with frequent experience using cloud-PBX and VoIP services.

 AAircall is a top VoIP service provider that offers many essential cloud communication tools, such as unlimited calling and business texting. It is one of the most expensive cloud communication services I tested. Even so, I found Aircall’s quality and service features made it worth consideration, particularly for enterprise-level companies that lack the budget constraints of a smaller organization. Joel Wolfe, President and founder of HiredSupport, shared his experience with using Aircall: “Running a company means getting everyone involved and this is what Aircall is all about. I acquired one local number and added additional contacts for just $6 per month. Its ease of use is what makes it special. All the adjustments I need to make can be done through the dashboard.” Aircall offers cloud-based business phone systems and call center tools. I was able to test its calling features, which I found to be of excellent quality. I also appreciated the ease with which I could set up a simple series of steps to direct callers to the desired department or individual. In addition to unlimited calling, Aircall provided me with a local phone number and business texting capabilities. Toll-free numbers are also available. Though Aircall conveniently integrates with dozens of third-party apps, the service is primarily centered on voice and text-based communication. As Aircall lacks video conferencing tools, I do not think it will work for businesses seeking an all-in-one communications solution instead of splitting these tools across multiple providers. One of my favorite add-on features offered by Aircall is its AI license, which costs $9 per month. In addition to AI-powered voicemail and talk-to-listen ratios, I appreciate its transcription and summarizing capabilities; these items offer the potential to save a great deal for any team members needing to catch up on missed details. Another ideal add on is the analytics tool for $15 monthly; it will be applied to all existing licenses. This feature not only unlocks advanced dashboards and filters but also easy-to-understand charts, “heat maps,” unlimited history, and even provides detailed data for key metrics, such as unanswered calls. Customer reviews for Aircall are largely positive. Customers find the interface to be attractive and modern. Although some reviewers find Aircall’s pricing a bit expensive, many consider it a good value for money. What negative reviews I did find focused on call and performance issues. For instance, some past customers disliked the lack of spam call protection. Meanwhile, others felt that the Aircall didn’t suit solopreneurs and small business owners. Aircall starts at $30 per month, per license, when paying annually, which is hard to justify compared to popular VoIP services that not only cost half as much but also include breakout chat rooms and video conferencing for no additional cost. In fact, for very small businesses, it would be hard to get good value for money compared to Google Voice or Zoom Phone, each of which start at a third of the monthly rate. Still, while I do not see Aircall working for solopreneurs or very small teams due to its fees, it could be a good option for enterprise-level businesses that want a reliable cloud-based calling and texting service. The Aircall apps are downloadable through Google Play and the App Store. The service also provides desktop software compatible with Windows and Mac devices; however, it does not work with Chromebook or Linux operating systems. I reached out to the customer service team for help with setting up an Aircall account. The team member was very patient and helpful and provided all the information necessary for using the service. Moreover, I consider Aircall’s help center knowledge base to be very detailed and useful in getting the most out of their product. Learn more: Read our full Aircall review. Who should use it:  Aircall works best for enterprise-level businesses with a solid budget and pre-existing handle on VoIP systems.

 If you are cautious about agreements and do not like the idea of committing to a VoIP provider long-term, then Ooma Office would be a great fit for your company. There are no contracts and Ooma lets you cancel at any time. David Idle, CPO of Bigleaf Networks, a leading provider of network optimization solutions, shared his thoughts on Ooma Office: “It’s a cost-effective solution with solid call quality and reliability, but it may lack some advanced features compared to enterprise-grade solutions. Overall, it’s a reliable choice for smaller businesses seeking an affordable communication solution.” I was assigned a toll-free number following a simple and quick signup process. I tested Ooma’s calling features; the audio was decent. Still, I was disappointed that you had to upgrade for access to key collaboration tools like video conferencing and text messaging, something that comes standard for many competitors at no additional cost. That said, you do get unlimited calling throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. Ooma Office has a decent range of add-on features, including international and “pay-as-you-go” calling, a personal phone number and voice-to-text. You can also port an existing phone number to your Ooma account. Customers had positive feedback for Ooma Office’s software, stating that they appreciated the service’s phone quality and features. Reviews also praised the customer support team and felt that the VoIP provider offered great service overall. Although customer feedback has been mostly positive, some claim that older reviews do not represent the current state of Ooma Office’s product or service, with concern that there has been a loss of quality. There were a few unhappy customers who claimed Ooma’s accounts and apps lack the appropriate connectivity across devices, impacting user experience (UX) negatively. Moreover, others have expressed that Ooma might not be a good fit for sole proprietors. Ooma Office starts at $19.95 per user per month. While some VoIP providers have slightly cheaper rates, Ooma’s offers the unique advantage of not requiring any form of contract. The lack of mandatory agreements means you could save money by avoiding early termination fees and other hidden costs. If you sign up for a month of service to see if Ooma is right for your VoIP needs and find that it is not the best fit, there is a 30-day money-back guarantee that alleviates any risk further. Ooma provides a downloadable version of its app for mobile called Ooma Telo. It is available for existing customers at no additional cost while new customers can use Telo following a one-time purchase. The app ensures you avoid missed calls, check voicemail messages easily and potentially save on international calling. I found the Ooma sales and support team to be very helpful. The company took a very proactive approach to ensuring I had the best possible experience with their service. For instance, a sales team member contacted me after signup to check that the process went smoothly and to confirm whether I needed any VoIP hardware. I did ultimately reach out to support with an account issue. It took a few minutes to clear everything up, and the support agent who assisted me was very knowledgeable and courteous.

Read More: How We Test VoIP Services Although I settled on the 10 VoIP services I think are the best options currently available, I recognize there are other VoIP providers worth considering. Here are some additional recommendations below. In addition to unlimited local and domestic long-distance calling, its service plans include auto-attendants, call waiting and forwarding, six-way conference calls, visual voicemail and more. Calling customers also get access to Webex Free, a no-cost conferencing solution that lets them hold meetings with a maximum of 100 attendees for up to 40 minutes. Overall, I believe Webex Calling could be a cost-effective option for companies seeking both virtual phone and collaboration tools. Openphone provides unlimited calling and texting to customers throughout Canada and the U.S. Accounts come with a local or toll-free number and features, such as voicemail transcripts, call recording and AI message responses. With a starting price of $15 per month, I believe Openphone falls within the budget of most businesses seeking a reliable VoIP provider. That said, it does lack video conferencing capabilities so if that is essential, you’ll have to try a different service. Line2 provides unlimited calls and texts to customers in the U.S. and Canada, like other VoIP services. But when reviewing the product, I found it also provides the convenience of call blocking and caller ID. While it may not have collaborative tools like video conferencing, chat and internet faxing, it is a serviceable cloud phone service. Line2 starts at $13.75 per month when billed annually. A VoIP system is a communications system that uses a computer, smartphone, VoIP phones or WebRTC-enabled browsers to make telephone calls and transfer information from one location to another. It accomplishes this through an internet connection. It differs from a traditional phone, also called a landline, in how it sends information and data. VoIP uses a broadband internet connection to transmit data, which is transformed from the original analog data, transmitted as digital data and then turned back into an analog signal so that you can understand what is being said. VoIP systems are often comprehensive office solutions offering voice mail, call recording, custom caller ID and voicemail-to-text features. Many offices use VoIP technology to create a UC system for the office that makes it easy for teams to communicate with customers and among themselves. SIP and VoIP are two acronyms that you will see when considering phone systems: VoIP technology can exist independently of more comprehensive SIP systems when all you need is phone call capabilities. When you need other data-sharing abilities, you need a SIP system. However, the marketplace often refers to more comprehensive solutions, such as VoIP solutions, creating confusion among consumers. There are many VoIP service providers vying for your business. It can be hard to distinguish the best VoIP service for you. There are even some free VoIP providers. Here are some key things to look for in the best business VoIP services. Ask an expert Alex Aristides Small Business Expert I would say the ultimate thing to consider when choosing a service is the support during the sale and support after the sale. If a company is not asking what your current issues are and current needs, that’s a red flag that they’re not doing their due diligence to give you the best experience. That is a salesman simply filling a quota. You’ll also want to vet out their implementation process and support. Any VoIP company requiring you to set up the system and program likely means their support will be just as poor. Look for the company that is concerned and cares about current problems and feature needs. Also look for a white glove experience for programming during the provisioning process and support processes and response. And don’t forget suggested network settings and documentation. For the most part, everyone supplies phone service and a phone call is a phone call. But who will service and hold your hands throughout the process is the most important. Small Business Expert VoIP costs can vary depending on several factors, including the type of service, the number of users and the features included. Some providers offer flat-rate pricing while others charge based on usage or the number of phone lines needed. Factors that impact cost include: To reduce costs, you can: When choosing between a more expensive and cheaper option, consider the following: Several factors can impact call quality and uptime when using VoIP services. These include: To assess a provider’s call quality and uptime during the buying process, you can: Key VoIP phone features to consider as you select a provider include: There are many other features to consider when selecting a VoIP system beyond the popular features we’ve noted above. As such, it’s essential to do your research in deciding what service plan to sign up for and what features will work best for your organization. When selecting which VoIP system features to purchase through service plans or add-ons, you should consider the following: Once you can answer a similar list regarding which VoIP features to invest in, you should move forward with choosing the best options for your business. Featured Partners 1 RingCentral $20 per user, per month (paid annually) Yes Yes 1 RingCentral On RingCentral's Website 2 Zoom Phone Starts at $10 per user, per month Yes Yes 2 Zoom Phone On Zoom's Website 3 Nextiva $18.95 per user, per month Yes Yes 3 Nextiva On Nextiva's Website VoIP is reliable because it uses your high-speed internet alongside back ISPs for redundancies. Traditional copper wire networks lack this level of flexibility or reliability, leading to more dropped calls or noise on the line. When you get a VoIP phone system, there are a lot of features that come with it. As a reminder, many of these benefits are the result of SIP technology but are packaged as part of your VoIP system. For everything that it does, VoIP systems are still usually cheaper than getting landlines for the same number of phone numbers. There are many advantages of VoIP, but there are also some disadvantages that you should consider before making the switch. One of the main disadvantages is that the phone system, thus the quality of calls, is completely reliant on the premises network/firewall settings and on the internet connection quality—the better the connection, the better the calls. However, if your internet connection goes down for any reason at any time, it’s possible VoIP or business desktop phones could also go down. Lesser-speed internet connections can also lead to call problems with dropped calls or jitter on the line. As with other devices connected to the internet, a VoIP connection may not always be secure. This means that the calls could be breached with others listening to calls. It is important to check with the company you are contracting for VoIP services to see if they use high-level encryption to protect you and your company data. With proper network security, TLS protocols, etc., VoIP can be safer than mobile or landline. VoIP needs an internet connection to work. You’ll need certain hardware to transfer the data. The hardware includes a personal computer and cable modem. If you are calling from a telephone, you’ll need a phone adapter or you’ll need to use a VoIP-ready phone. The adapter converts analog signals into digital signals that allow them to be transferred over the internet. During the call, the data is transferred back to an analog signal so that the other party can understand what is being said. If you’re using VoIP from a mobile phone, you can connect to the internet wirelessly to transmit the data. Data is stored in the cloud and accessed via a dashboard on the computer or mobile device. Data may include contacts and business phone numbers. Most business owners think that all VoIP systems are the same. There are some differences in the types of VoIP services that you can get. A hosted VoIP service is different from an on-premises VoIP solution. When things are on-premises, everything from the equipment to the connection is installed and maintained by the company deploying the system. When hosted, the VoIP system is maintained by the provider of the system. The business deploying the phone system only needs to supply the phones and internet connection. The provider assumes all other expensive hardware costs. Hosted, cloud-based VoIP phone systems use the internet to make calls and host everything on the provider’s server network. When a business chooses this type of phone system, they don’t have to manage hardware―they plug the phones in and dial. UCaaS is a more robust VoIP platform able to supply a full end-to-end solution and feature set that’s more than simple calls and mobile apps. It relies on six key communications functions. The six communications functions are: The UCaaS goes beyond the VoIP solutions and incorporates SIP solutions as well. Systems can be customized to serve particular business needs. The best UCaaS providers help businesses improve their processes and streamline daily operations. Communications platform as a service (CPaaS) offers cloud-based, customized communications services for UC systems. Most often, you will encounter CPaaS when UCaaS is integrated into CRM services. As with standard UCaaS, CPaaS is fully adaptable to any business and its needs. Everything is integrated to work in real time on the platform and doesn’t need to access outside systems. Fixed VoIP services are provided through a dedicated internet connection, such as a digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable line. They are typically more reliable and consistent in terms of call quality and uptime. They are also more secure, as the internet connection is not shared with other users. Examples of fixed VoIP services include: Nonfixed VoIP services, on the other hand, are provided through a shared internet connection, such as a Wi-Fi or cellular network. These services are typically less reliable and may be subject to dropped calls or poor call quality due to network congestion. They are also less secure, as the internet connection is shared with other users. Examples of nonfixed VoIP services include: Fixed VoIPs are best for businesses that operate in a single physical location and require a high level of reliability and security; non-fixed VoIP services suit individuals and teams that operate on the go or need additional flexibility. VoIP hardware and equipment refers to the devices and peripherals needed to make and receive VoIP calls. While this varies by provider, there are four main types of equipment. The types of equipment needed for VoIP typically include: Service providers typically offer a variety of equipment options and some providers include the cost of the equipment as part of their plans while others may charge extra for the equipment or require the customer to purchase it separately. Companies can also use their existing equipment, such as analog phones, with an adapter. However, the quality of the call may not be as good as it would be with an IP phone designed specifically for VoIP systems. A lot of the work to set up the VoIP system starts with choosing the right VoIP system. Choose a provider that offers the hardware support, such as phones that you will need for your office. Decide how many lines you will need. As you select a provider, you will also want to address needs such as porting over an existing number to your new system. If your business has been around for a while, maintaining the consistency of numbers is important. Be sure to let the provider know this as you sign up for the service. Once you have chosen a provider and allowed them to do the initial setup on their end, the next item of business is to plug the system in. This means connecting the communications device (phone or computer) to the internet. Your provider will walk you through the configuration steps to ensure that your calls are transferring across the network properly. Test the system to see if any issues need troubleshooting. Because VoIP is a comprehensive solution that most providers offer, there are add-ons that you can request to customize your business and serve its unique needs. When requesting a phone number, you can ask the provider for a virtual phone number or a vanity phone number. A virtual phone number allows you to have a number from a geographic region that you are not residing in, helping you better serve customers from anywhere in the world. A vanity phone number is easy to remember because it associates letters with the numbers, often representing part of the company name or slogan. Businesses can use video conferencing to host internal meetings or to have a virtual face-to-face with customers. This is part of the new business model, particularly post-pandemic and is something most businesses will want as an add-on to their business model. VoIP integrates the best video conferencing software with call functions. Hosting conference calls is an important way to hold a virtual meeting or seminar. Top VoIP providers use the best conference call technology and make it a seamless experience. Most businesses want their phone system to integrate with their CRM software. This means that your phone representatives have access to pertinent client details and purchases as they make the call. It’s an efficient way to provide your people with data. Top VoIP providers work with the best CRM systems. VoIP technology has many uses and can be beneficial for various industries and business scenarios. Some of the most common use cases include: VoIP technology can also be used for other industries such as construction, finance, nonprofits, government agencies and many more. As the technology continues to evolve and improve, the possibilities for VoIP use cases will continue to expand. VoIP is subject to a variety of regulatory concerns. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has established regulations for VoIP services. These regulations are intended to ensure that consumers have access to reliable and affordable VoIP services and promote market competition. Some key regulatory concerns for VoIP include: It’s important for companies to be aware of these regulations and to comply with them to avoid any potential penalties or fines. The FCC provides detailed information and guidelines on its website. Check them frequently, as the regulations may change over time.

 There are many burgeoning 2024 VoIP trends, and being aware of them will help your business remain competitive in our rapidly evolving digital world. VoIP technology is the cornerstone of UCaaS models. These systems and cloud-based service packages have been gaining traction in recent years, especially following the events of the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote working mandates highlighted the usefulness of VoIP-based systems, allowing employees to maintain effective communication through various methods without relying on a physical connection. UCaaS now includes a wide variety of communication tools, including voice calls, instant chat, video calling, email integration and file sharing. These functions are critical to communication on a global scale and VoIP technology is the basis for all of them. UCaaS companies that offer more ways to connect with their partners and customers will be more competitive in the future. we expect to see the UCaaS market continue to grow in 2024 and beyond. In 2020, the market value of UCaaS was around $38.74 billion and this number is projected to reach $210.07 billion by 2028. Adding VoIP systems into existing business operating systems and tech stacks is becoming easier than ever. With cloud-based systems, it is possible to add additional components to a current system without much effort. Easily modifiable VoIP tools that work well alongside existing systems will be at a distinct advantage in the coming years. Advancements in language processing and machine learning have resulted in smarter and more effective voice assistants. AI can classify and redirect incoming messages quickly, answer basic customer questions accurately and interpret user behavior and sentiment from conversation content and tone. The assistant sends data about the interaction back to the system automatically for analysis so that future interactions can be optimized further. AI voice assistants will continue to improve in 2024 and beyond. As with any internet-based entity, VoIP is vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks that can have major consequences for the businesses they serve. Breaches in security can lead to disruptions in business operations and potentially risk litigation from affected parties. Some of the most common risks to VoIP systems are phishing, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, call tampering, malware and viruses, voice over misconfigured internet telephones (VOMIT) and spam over IP telephony (SPIT). In 2019, 38% of small businesses had no systems in place for managing cybersecurity threats and about 46% of illegal calls were made through VoIP systems. In 2024, I expect companies utilizing VoIP technology to devote more resources into securing the networks that businesses rely upon. This way, businesses can function without issue and continue to protect and serve their customers. Here’s how to ensure you’re staying protected: The top three VoIP phone services for business available today include RingCentral, Dialpad and Zoom Phone. These providers offer toll-free numbers, voicemail transcription and other popular VoIP features at affordable pricing from as low as $10 per month. To use VoIP, you’ll need a reliable and fast internet connection. Because it’s a cloud-based tool, a lack of online service means you wouldn’t be able to use it. VoIP and Wi-Fi calling are similar. VoIP sends digital data packets over the internet that are converted to analog phone signals at the recipient’s end. Wi-Fi calling connects a phone call through the internet rather than a cell tower. In general, using a VoIP phone, including a VoIP cellphone, is very secure. However, there are steps that you can take to increase the security levels even more. These include verifying that your VoIP provider offers an encrypted connection, implementing a SIP-capable firewall that filters all incoming calls for any content that puts your system at risk and having your information technology (IT) staff create a virtual local area network (VLAN) for all of your internal calls to take place, keeping them from being put at risk from outside sources. Make sure that your staff remains diligent when using their VoIP phones so that they can avoid risks such as voice phishing, also known as vishing. To get VoIP phone service, you will need to find a VoIP provider that offers service in your area and sign up for service. You can search online, ask for recommendations or check with your internet service provider. Once you have chosen a provider, it will send you the necessary equipment and instructions for setting up and using the service. Yes, most VoIP providers allow you to port your existing phone number to their service. This means that you can keep your current phone number when switching to a VoIP service, which can be convenient for businesses and individuals. Check with the provider for additional costs or requirements for the number porting process. Yes, it is possible to fax over VoIP using a fax machine or a computer with a fax modem. Some VoIP providers offer fax-to-email services, which allow you to send and receive faxes via email. However, it’s important to check with the provider for any additional costs or requirements for this service. It is possible to fax over VoIP using a fax machine or a computer with a fax modem. Some VoIP providers offer fax-to-email services, which allow you to send and receive faxes via email. However, it’s important to check with the provider for any additional costs or requirements for this service. VoIP phones depend on having a consistent, reliable internet connection. Without the web, you won’t be able to place or receive any calls with them. For this reason, your internet speed must be fast and stable enough so as not to impede VoIP performance—critical for ensuring communication between your business and its stakeholders runs smoothly every time.

                In 2003, Alex Aristides, armed with expertise in voice/data cable infrastructure, IT, PBX, voicemail and contact centers, embarked on an entrepreneurial journey after leaving his role as a PBX Installation Coordinator. Initially a solo endeavor, his company quickly evolved into a subsidiary of major contracting firms. Despite facing challenges in the competitive telecom and cabling industry, including branching into physical security and a stint as vice president of operations, Alex sought a more fulfilling path. In 2010, he made a bold decision to start anew, founding M2S VOIP with a laptop, a credit card, and a vision. Learning from past experiences, he prioritized independence and innovation, transforming M2S from a local integrator to a national leader in hosted Voice Over IP services. Today, M2S VoIP stands out for its carrier-grade SIP cloud PBX, comprehensive offerings and commitment to personalized service, setting itself apart in an industry dominated by standard solutions.
