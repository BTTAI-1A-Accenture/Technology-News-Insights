AI, or artificial intelligence, is technology that attempts to simulate human cognitive function. AI has made its way into the software development space in a number of ways. Visit the AI article list to expand your AI knowledge. Learn More Observability is a way for development teams in an organization to view their program state. Failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures. Read about the latest observability content here Learn More In the past, the CI/CD pipeline was simply a place to integrate code. Developers would write their code in GitHub, pass it through the pipeline, and then deploy it. The pipeline has become a much more critical piece of the software delivery lifecycle today. Learn More Modern cloud-native applications, often leverage microservices, containers, APIs, infrastructure-as-code and more to enable speed in app development and deployment Learn More Sponsored By: Always On, Always Fast Deploy Distributed PostgreSQL in just 90 Seconds Learn More  The Importance of Security Testing With more development teams today using open-source and third-party components to build out their applications, the biggest area of concern for security teams has become the API. This is where vulnerabilities are likely to arise, as keeping on top of updating those interfaces has lagged. Read the Guide Here Mobile App Testing involves analyzing mobile apps for functionality, usability, visual appeal, and consistency across multiple mobile devices. It helps ensure an optimal user experience, irrespective of the device used to access the app. Learn More Today’s distributed software environments incorporate a variety of APIs with every interface your software touches, from mobile to microservices. Each API has to be continuously tested and verified to ensure your software functions as it should. Parasoft’s API testing platform makes quick, efficient, and intelligent work of such requirements. Learn More Ensure your application’s resilience, and make sure your software performs as expected under diverse operating conditions. (sponsored by Parasoft) Learn More    DevSecOps is the DevOps community’s approach to bringing security into the development lifecycle. Businesses want to deliver software, but cannot afford to release unreliable or insecure applications— therefore security needs to be baked in much sooner than it has traditionally been. Learn More Securing an application is just as important as building it in the first place. As data becomes more valuable, there are more people who want to steal it and use it for their own personal gain. Making sure applications are indeed secure has always been a challenge, as hackers try to stay one step ahead of defenders. Learn More Secrets are essential for integrating your infrastructure with databases and SaaS services. Doppler‘s developer-first security platform empowers teams to manage, orchestrate, and govern secrets across any environment. In 2023, there was an 18% decline in the number of open-source projects that are considered to be “actively maintained.” This is according to Sonatype’s Annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report. Learn More Development Managers need a different type of content than developers… They need to know what platforms, tools, trends, and issues they should be thinking about. SD Times delivers those unique topics here Learn More Agile software development has been around since the 1990s, but didn’t get the name until the famous meeting of 17 renowned software development thought leaders at Snowbird, Utah resulted in an Agile Manifesto. The idea behind Agile software development is to reduce time to market by enabling faster iterations of smaller segments of software. Learn More Value stream management involves people in the organization to examine workflows and other processes to ensure they are deriving the maximum value from their efforts while eliminating waste — of resources, time and assets. It is the practice that truly brings the business side and IT side together as partners in creating value for the organization. Learn More Learn More DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. Learn More Gravitee helps organizations manage and secure their entire API lifecycle with solutions for API design, management, security, productization, real-time observability, and more.

Learn More Next-gen developer platform provider Rookout and APM solution provider AppDynamics are teaming up to help developers find and fix bugs. According to the companies, AppDynamics alerts developers of any issues while Rookout helps developers debug those issues.  As part of the partnership, Rookout will be integrated into AppDynamics to create AppDynamics Deep Code Insights.  “It’s a match made in DevOps heaven! The ability to jump directly from an AppDynamics issue to the data and code in-action that caused the error without restarting, redeploying, or adding more code — that’s the magic of DCI/Rookout,” the Rookout team wrote in a post.  RELATED CONTENT: APMs are more important than ever for microservice-based architectures According to Rookout, debugging is becoming more complex, time consuming and costly as applications are becoming more modern and distributed. With Rookout, development teams can save up to 80% of time and focus on more pressing issues like shipping new features and improving consumer experience. With Deep Code Insights, developer efficiency is increased by more than 25%. Together, the companies hope to close the gaps between code-related performance problems and deploying a seamless customer experience.  Features include visibility into production, ability to securely capture data on demand, more context into dynamic watchpoints, and ability to understand how app performance is impacting the business and customers in real time.  “As the APM solution surfaces up alerts (such as errors, or performance degradation), these more often than not translate in the minds of the engineers as questions – mainly ‘why is this happening?’. Instead of being forced to replicate the situation, or redeploy with more logging, AppDyanmic’s users can simply click a button to immediately collect more variables and data to the screen in front of them, or dive to a deeper session within the full Rookout/DCI IDE like experience,” the Rookout team wrote.
