 The NASDAQ stock exchange has granted Yandex's request and will not delist the shares of a class A firm, according to a press release from Yandex. "Wikipedia" is the image source. In March of this year, NASDAQ issued a notice of delisting. The majority of Yandex's activities will be spun off into a separate group of companies, while Yandex's management will keep control of the remaining entities. Yandex's stock will remain on the exchange list as long as they are valid, although trading in them will continue to be prohibited. On the Moscow Exchange, Yandex's stock is traded as usual. Due to events in Ukraine, the Nasdaq closed trading in Yandex's parent company Yandex NV on February 28, 2022. Two weeks later, the exchange announced its intention to delist the securities of Yandex and several other Russian businesses.
