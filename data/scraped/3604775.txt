 Outsourcing in simple language is a business practice in which services or job functions are hired out to a third party on a contract or ongoing basis. All about knowledge outsourcing in Auto sector? Henry ford said century ago that If there is a thing that we cannot do more efficiently, cheaper or better than a competition, there is no point in doing it further – we should hire the one who does it better than we do. The OEM’s product is the complete vehicle, while each tech partner can focus on those feature deliverables where it specializes. So where the OEM needs to concentrate on delivering a vehicle package that will attract the buyer which holds the brand values, a supplier can put their best foot forward to what they are known for. In addition to reduced direct working capital and Operational costs, outsourcing allows OEMs to delegate commercial risk to its partners. Any contract between OEM and supplier will discuss volume projections for a given program, by outsourcing to a range of partners, the risk associated is distributed among the technology partners. There are plenty of reasons apart from cost, let us go through few what is there to my knowledge. Pro’s of outsourcing: ·        Innovation  ·        Off the shelf product ·        Quick to market ·        Talent pool Rationality behind having technology partners: ·        Lack of capability building time ·        Lack of Knowledge on special areas ·        Future readiness ·        Ahead of market/competitors ·        Product specialization ·        Revenue sharing on forming strategic alliance I will briefly touch upon couple of above rationales.  Lack of capability/ Knowledge building time – Yes, true! Considering the stiff competition, less time, lack of capital and resource to focus on innovation Revenue sharing on forming strategic alliance – It is very prevalent among the cloud technology partners in terms of subscription and the maintenance of the existing vehicles which is directly proportional to the volume of vehicles sold it also applicable to the actual electronics hardware technology partners as well, where the development cost is once and the yields or revenue which is generated depends on the volume of the vehicles sold. It also increases the ownership of tech partners towards the end product which directly affects the brand value of the tech partners if anything goes wrong on the flip side, if everything goes well the brand value gets multifold. Nowadays even before the actual product launch or during the launch tech partners are coming to the limelight so the end customers/techies will have an eye on who is holding the core value behind the key features, it also adds on to the ownership and delivering perfectly to the ground. This actually kindles and drives the tech partners to showcase the innovation on the table by means of tech show or workshop to increase the award of projects from OEM. How to evaluate the Technology partner to work on a project? Unavailability of skilled resource at present is the reason why tech partners are approached by OEM, but it is still a mystery, on how the evaluation is justifiable to award a project, is it based on quotes of the project or the proven track records of tech partners of their previous deliverables or purely based on brand value of tech partners. How to evaluate? By Upskilling?, Hire a CTO /tech partner in the field of expertise? It goes in loop right? No concrete answer yet. To overcome this many OEM has started the child technology organization within their umbrella( CARIAD, MBition, MSDVC) to drive this forward to have the technology development inside it’s shell to bring in innovation without involving much external partners, but it is still long way to go System Architect |Product development Lead|Connected Car|Infotainment|OTA|SDV|PSPO certified|People enabler| Aspiring Impactful Leader|Cricket enthusiast Welcoming progressive thoughts and comments.
