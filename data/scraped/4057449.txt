North Carolina State University researchers along with scientists from Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed a technique for using quantum sensors' power. Researchers introduced a novel approach using photo-responsive perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to create multifunctional displays. By integrating touch control, ambient light sensing, image sensing, and photovoltaic functionalities into individual pixels, this innovative display technology eliminates the need for separate sensors. In December 2023, KROHNE made Ethernet-APL demo devices available to selected customers. This step marks an important milestone in the company's own Ethernet APL development project for various sensor types. A portable, reasonably priced photoacoustic sensing device promises to accelerate and improve clinical diagnostics for better patient outcomes. Monitoring the remarkable shifts in land use throughout the last century, global land cover maps offer crucial perspectives on how human settlement has influenced the environment. University of Leicester computer scientists have developed an innovative technology aimed at managing the increasing demands on mobile networks from multiple users through the utilization of Terahertz frequencies. Yahong Rosa Zheng, an expert in underwater wireless communications and a Professor in the Lehigh University Electrical and Computer Engineering department, is at the forefront of a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded initiative. In the field of engineering and materials science, the identification of concealed structures or imperfections within materials is of paramount importance. The Muometric Wireless Navigation System (MuWNS), harnessing cosmic-ray muons from outer space, has been recognized as one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2023 for its groundbreaking capability to facilitate navigation in subterranean and underwater environments. Lockheed Martin today announced the opening of its Operations Center of the Future, a technology test bed showcasing how tomorrow’s satellite operators will be able to manage multiple space missions simultaneously ­using a web-based, secure cloud infrastructure.
