The family of 70-year-old Alma Young told WTVC that Lydia Brock, 28, was wearing a hospital gown when she entered Young's room at a hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Ronny Young, the victim's husband, said Brock told Alma Young that she was being released from the hospital.  "You don't work here, get out of here," Ronny Young said to Brock, noticing that she was wearing a hospital gown. Suzan Clayton, the victim's daughter-in-law, said Brock even went as far as to tell Alma Young that she planned to remove her IV.  When Brock was asked to leave the room, she became aggressive and refused to leave, Clayton added. Hospital staff told police that Brock came into the hospital as a patient.  Brock allegedly removed one patient from an IV and hospital monitoring equipment, according to WTVC. Hospital staff also said that they found vials of blood inside Brock's purse, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The court records obtained by WTVC also show that hospital security found a hospital employee identification badge in Brock's purse, but that there was no evidence that she is actually a hospital employee.  Security also allegedly found fentanyl, lidocaine, and syringes in Brock's bag as well as several different pill bottles prescribed by multiple doctors, according to police records.
