Learn More › The washing machine is the workhorse of the laundry room. It deals with dirty towels, sweaty gym clothes, and a whole lot of other gross stuff. Over time, detergent residue, bacteria, and dirt can build up in a washing machine, leading to musty smells in the machine and not-so-clean laundry. An unpleasant whiff from your washer may mean it’s due for a deep clean. A washing machine cleaner is a reliable solution to clean the nooks and crannies of a washer. Washing machine cleaners are formulated for either internal or surface cleaning. Liquid, gel, and tablets are intended to be run through the wash cycle, while sprays and wipes are applied to the surface of the washer and the interior of the drum. The following list of washing machine cleaners cut through grime and leave a washer smelling fresh. The best washing machine cleaners break down grime without degrading the washer’s rubber and plastic parts. Frequent cleaning can boost the efficiency and lifespan of a washer. Most washing machine cleaners work in both top-loading and front-loading machines. Just make sure to check if the cleaner is for standard or for high-efficiency (HE) washers. There are four general types of washing machine cleaners. A liquid or gel washing machine cleaner is an easy-to-use option. Most of these cleaners go in the detergent drawer or a washer drum for a hot-water wash cycle. Liquid and gel cleaners hit all the nooks and crannies inside a washer that are hard to reach by hand. Liquid cleaners wash away easily, so users aren’t left with remnants of the cleaner the next time they do laundry. They won’t leave behind gunk or powder residue. Washing machine cleaner tablets dissolve throughout the cleaning cycle. Their slow-acting formula breaks down tough residue and flushes it away. They’re super simple to use, too: Just toss them in the empty washer on a hot-water cycle. Best of all, tablets are convenient to store. One pouch of tablets can hold months’ worth of grime-fighting ability. There’s also less chance of spills or messes with tablets. Washing machine cleaner sprays are another quick and easy option. Most don’t need a wash cycle to do their job, and some don’t even need wiping or rinsing; just spray it and forget it. Since they’re so convenient they’re perfect for everyday use, and they’re a low-effort way to keep smells and bacteria at bay. Sprays can be used in the washer drum and also for cleaning machine surfaces, like buttons and rubber door seals, that pods or most liquid cleaners can’t reach. If there’s stubborn buildup that needs scrubbing, reach for wipes, an all-in-one option for cleaning your washing machine. The best washing machine cleaner wipes are safe to use on all the machine’s surfaces: the washer drum, door, and outer parts. There’s no need to run a wash cycle or wipe off the cleaner when you’re done. They are a good option to keep on hand for daily or weekly maintenance. The best washing machine cleaner is tough on grime but gentle on washing machine parts. It removes gunk without damaging door seals and rubber gaskets. Effective cleaners break down residue and water deposits while killing bacteria and mildew. For washers with a stubborn odor, look for a cleaner with an odor-removing boost. Hard water can cause problems in your washing machine. It can cause limescale—a hard coating that sticks to the inside of a washing machine. Limescale deposits are unsightly and if they accumulate in pipes and the washer drum, they can leave a residue on clothes. Limescale buildup can even make appliances less energy efficient. Limescale is tough to remove, but there are washing machine cleaners specially formulated to dissolve it. Before you notice dirt or buildup in your washer, you might notice its smell: that funky, wet-socks odor. Freshly cleaned clothes may smell damp and musty, too. It’s a sign your washing machine needs some TLC. Mold, mildew, and bacteria are the main causes of washing machine odors. To get rid of the odor, you have to get rid of those nasties. The best washing machine cleaners do just that. For washers that have a lingering smell, users may need to do a second cleaning with a washing machine cleaner specially formulated to neutralize odors. Your clothes (and your nose) will thank you. Frequent use and damp conditions make the washer an ideal home for germs, mildew, mold, and bacteria. Eco-friendly laundry practices like cold water washes don’t effectively kill bacteria. To be safe, run a bacteria-removing deep clean every once in a while. The following washing machine cleaners top the list for being easy to use and effective.
