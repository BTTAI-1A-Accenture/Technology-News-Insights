Listen to this article:  The Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji (CAAF) says it has withdrawn flight information service stations for the Rotuma, Savusavu, Matei and Labasa aerodromes. CAAF acting CEO Rigamoto Aisake said this to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs during a review of the 2020 CAAF annual report tabled in Parliament recently. He said in September last year the withdrawal was related to the reduction in volume of air traffic into the aerodromes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Keeping these flight information service stations open during this period of time was deemed not practical, costly and unjustifiable for Fiji Airport’s sustainable operations,” he said. “As a result, a safety assessment was conducted by Fiji Airports in accordance with their safety management system. “This safety assessment reviewed the potential hazards and associated risks. “The conduct of the safety assessment by Fiji Airports included consultation with all stakeholders (Fiji Meteorological Service, Domestic Airline Operators) and CAAF. “The permanent withdrawal of flight information service from the abovementioned aerodromes came into effect from 30th October 2020. “These airports continue to operate without flight information service and Fiji Airports and CAAF continue to monitor the situation to ensure, when required, the service is reinstated.” Flight information service is a service provided for the purpose of giving advice and information useful for the safe and efficient conduct of flights.
