Cristian Stellini insists he has total trust in Tottenham defender Davinson Sanchez and would have no hesitation in playing him in Sunday‚Äôs key fixture at Newcastle. Sanchez endured an afternoon to forget in last Saturday‚Äôs 3-2 defeat at home to Bournemouth and was substituted only 23 minutes after being introduced. The centre-back was booed by his own supporters following an error that resulted in a goal and Stellini‚Äôs decision to replace the Colombian was met with a mixture of cheers and boos. It was a horrible moment for a player who has spent six years at Spurs and captain Hugo Lloris was critical of the fans‚Äô reaction immediately after the loss. ‚ÄúYes, he trained well this week and he will be involved in the match,‚Äù Stellini said of Sanchez. ‚ÄúWhether it will be from the start, I don‚Äôt know, but I spoke with him clearly and that goes for all the players who train well. ‚ÄúThis is not a player we don‚Äôt know. He has played many, many games for Tottenham and we believe in him, we trust him.‚Äù Stellini revealed he had spoken to Sanchez in detail this week about his own decision to withdraw the former Ajax defender from the firing line so quickly after his part in Bournemouth‚Äôs second goal. He admitted it was rare to see fans boo their own player but urged the supporters to show appreciation for the 26-year-old the next time he does play for Spurs. ‚ÄúYeah, I hope this happens because players, before being players, are men,‚Äù Stellini added. This is not a player we don't know. He has played many, many games for Tottenham and we believe in him, we trust him Cristian Stellini on Davinson Sanchez ‚ÄúThey need the opportunity to react, the opportunity to do better, the opportunity to do their best. The fans are an important part of this. ‚ÄúI spoke with Patron (Sanchez). We had a good conversation and of course it is tough for a player to come in and then come out of the pitch. It is the type of thing that also happened to me when I played. ‚ÄúIt is not the best moment you can live, but the type of thing that has to give you a reaction, a good reaction. I asked him to have a good reaction, to train well and to do his best. ‚ÄúHe is a good guy, he understood the moment during the last game, so he accepted the situation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very rare (the booing), but I think if it happens it‚Äôs important you react to have the fans back with you. I want to help him to have this situation, We have to work together to reach this.‚Äù Defeat at home to Bournemouth seriously dented Spurs‚Äô faint hopes of a top-four finish and they face a pivotal seven days.

But Antonio Conte‚Äôs former number two said: ‚ÄúHow many people would like to be here? I think it is a dream, so I am enjoying it of course and I‚Äôm trying to do my best. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs an experience that makes me stronger, with more experience. ‚ÄúI think I could improve a lot, but I don‚Äôt know what happens in the future. I‚Äôm not focused on that. I am focused on improving the team, improve myself and make the best decisions.‚Äù Matt Harmon and Dr. Renee Miller explain the human psychology of some of the most common fantasy pitfalls on Friday's episode of 'Yahoo Fantasy Forecast'.
