  An Ogun State High Court sitting in Ijebu Ode has dismissed an ex-parte application filed by the suspended chairman of Ijebu East local government area, Hon. Wale Adedayo, praying the court to stop further investigations by the council’s lawmakers against him. In its ruling on the ex-parte argued by Barrister O. T. Are, standing in for A.M. Kotoye (SAN) on behalf of  Adedayo, the trial judge, Justice A.A. Omoniyi, dismissed the application in “its entirety.” LEADERSHIP recalled that the council’s lawmakers recently suspended Adedayo in continuation of investigations on alleged financial malpractices and directed the vice chairman of the council to take over pending the conclusion of its investigation. Are told the court of the motion ex-parte dated September 6, 2022, praying for an interim order restraining the defendants, their agents, privies from further proceeding on the letter of invitation to the claimant asking him to appear before the Legislative Council on September 14, 2023, or in the alternative to order parties to maintain the status quo. In its ruling, the court said the application by the plaintiff was not timely since he had received a notice on 31st August, 2023, of the said resolution but waited till September 11, 2023, before filing his application. “Delay defeats equity,” the judge said. The claimant was ordered to put the Defendants on notice and come back for the hearing of the originating summons on September 22, 2023.      © 2024 Leadership Media Group - All Rights Reserved.  © 2024 Leadership Media Group - All Rights Reserved.
