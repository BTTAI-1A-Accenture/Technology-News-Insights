             Edtech companies are turning to artificial intelligence to retain students, Jyoti Banthia reports for businessline. On the back of investor pressure and funding slowdown, various startups like Vedantu, Scaler, and Emeritus are applying AI for scalability, growth, and building efficiency, the report adds.

In addition to offering personalised learning experiences, AI has been providing assistance for customer support, content creation, upskilling, and developing innovative assessment methods.

Tutoring platform CueMath is addressing the student-teacher ratio by enabling the latter to utilise AI to generate prompts. This assists students in solving problems.

Emeritus’s COO Bhushan Heda shares that AI helps with identifying student needs, skill gaps in the marketplace, and “deliver on relevant topics.”

Vedantu invests about $2 million a year on AI and is integrating it into its products and educational content for an “immersive and personalised experience,” shares CEO Vamsi Krishna.

Scaler reports a 33% increase in learners after the introduction of its AI-powered teaching assistant.

The companies, however, also stress on the importance of human guidance — teachers who create meaningful learning experience and foster students’ development, the article states.

             Are Edtech Firms Important?

Absolutely! Edtech firms play a crucial role in modern education for several reasons:

1. Accessibility: Edtech firms often provide digital learning solutions that are accessible to a wide range of learners, breaking down geographical and physical barriers. 

2. Personalized Learning: Educational technology allows for personalized learning experiences. Adaptive learning platforms and AI-driven tools can assess students' strengths and weaknesses and tailor lessons accordingly, helping students learn at their own pace.

3. Flexibility: Edtech enables flexible learning schedules. Students can access educational content and resources whenever and wherever they choose.

4. Data-driven Insights: Educational technology collects data on student performance and engagement. This data can be analyzed to identify areas where students may be struggling and to improve teaching methods.

5. Cost-effective Solutions: Edtech can reduce the cost of education by eliminating the need for physical textbooks and reducing overhead associated with traditional classrooms. 

6. Global Learning Communities: Online learning platforms create opportunities for students to connect with peers and educators from around the world, fostering diverse and inclusive learning environments.

Edtech firms are important because they revolutionize education by making it more accessible, personalized, engaging, and adaptable to the needs of learners in an ever-changing world. Their contributions to education are essential for the future of learning and skill development.

             Educational institutions worldwide are embracing the use of AI technologies in their services and operations like never before!

The classrooms of the future hold the promise of becoming personalized spaces for exploration, creativity, and critical thinking tailored to meet each student's needs rather than following a one-size-fits-all approach.

AI can provide lessons that are designed for teaching, opening up endless possibilities to transform pedagogical methods on a global scale through this revolutionary shift. This vision is now becoming possible with advancements in emerging technologies and artificial Intelligence.

However, despite its benefits, many educational institutions are still skeptical about using generative AI. From my perspective, I firmly believe that prohibiting AI in educational institutions will result in more harm than good.

In this article, I walk you through some strategies that educational institutions can adopt to improve learning processes, administrative tasks, and overall efficiency.
It would be exciting to share insights on how these technological advancements are reshaping the educational landscape.

             Now that generative AI has already had an impact on edtech, here are a few things for-profit edtech companies may need to consider:
-  If you are thinking of speeding up design and development using generative AI (on the product side), that’s something any edtech firm can do today: lesson plans, storyboards, multiple-choice questions, question banks, worksheets, video production, dubbing. 
- If you are thinking of ‘personalising’ your solutions through AI (conversations that aid learning for instance – well, more question-answer than conversations actually), that too could be done by any edtech firm today.
-  Therefore, these questions become all the more critical:
o  What are you designing, and who are you designing it for? Why? How? 
o  What is your pedagogical approach? Why do you think it’s effective? Where do you think it won’t be effective? Do you care?
o  Why should teachers or students opt for your product?
o  How is it better than current open education solutions in the same category (YouTube tutors, exam prep sites, Khan Academy)? What evidence do you have to prove that?
o  If your users (students and teachers) were also your customers (instead of schools and parents), would they be willing to pay for what you position as your uniqueness? Why? Why not? The answers to these questions could serve as a more honest appraisal of your product’s value than of the things that come with it – like marketing, relationship building and services – which are secondary to teaching and learning.
o  Has the edtech ‘market’ been commoditized? Or does it still believe in the power of specific commercial edtech solutions to make genuine improvements in school systems, teaching and learning?
