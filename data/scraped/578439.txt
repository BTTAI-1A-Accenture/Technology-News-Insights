Tim Love of Stonington just announced the release of his latest book, “Discovering Truth: How to Navigate Between Fact & Fiction in an Overwhelming Social Media World,” published by Internationalist Press. The book is based on Love’s popular podcast series, “Discovering Truth,” which examines the difficulty of determining truth in a world of heightened social media information and data, not to mention propaganda and lies. The book draws insights from marketing and communication legends like Paul Polman, former CEO of Unilever; John Pepper, former chairman of Procter & Gamble and The Walt Disney Company, and even legendary ethologist Jane Goodall, founder of the Jane Goodall Institute. The book also includes Love’s personal “Truth Memoirs” which include his meeting P&G’s legendary CEOs Redwood Dupree and John Smale. Love is a former vice chairman of Omnicom Group, the leading worldwide advertising and marketing services company. Since retiring, Love has taught an MBA course at Oxford University’s Said School of Business on “Branding and Communication.” Prior books by the author are “Think Like The Sun” (Aspatore) and “The Book That Gets Better With Age” (LID London). Love said he will be presenting the book to the Stonington-Mystic Men’s Group on morning of June 2 at Mystic YMCA. Niantic Rotary will be helping to plant potatoes and spread compost during its Day of Service on May 20.  The club’s Rotarians and East Lyme High School Interact club hope to raise enough funds through a raffle to purchase a compost spreader for the East Lyme Giving Garden, which provided almost 8,000 pounds of food to area food pantries last year, and offers free classes to the community. Another Rotary project is the Miracle League of Southeastern Connecticut. The club wants to continue support by making a substantial donation towards a phase 2 restroom/playscape project. Raffle tickets can be purchased online until June 12, by going to nianticrotary.org. Paper tickets can be purchased at Max’s Package Store in East Lyme. Visit nianticrotary.org or follow their page on Facebook @ nianticrotaryclub. Comment threads are monitored for 48 hours after publication and then closed.
