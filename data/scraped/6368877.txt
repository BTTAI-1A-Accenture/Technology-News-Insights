A colourful socialite known as “Hot Mess” has returned to court, where he is charged with drug importation offences. A colourful Melbourne socialite has returned to court, where he is facing charges for his role in an alleged drug importation syndicate. Anthony Hess, or “Hot Mess” as he is also known, on Friday afternoon briefly fronted the Melbourne Magistrates’ Court, where a judge set down a date for a further committal hearing in May.  Mr Hess, whose varied career has included sex work and influencing, is charged with attempting to import a commercial quantity of cocaine and methamphetamine into Australia, and attempt to import a marketable quantity of ketamine. Charge sheets released by the court also reveal Mr Hess is charged with attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine and methamphetamine and a marketable quantity of ketamine.  Mr Hess, 42, was charged as a part of a joint Victoria Police and Australian Federal Police investigation into an alleged drug ring they said tried to import 15kg of drugs into the country from the US and Europe.  At a previous hearing in September, Mr Hess’s lawyer Melissa Huseyin said her client faced a “substantial” police brief, and she needed more time.  Mr Hess, whose address is listed as South Melbourne on the charge sheets, shot to prominence in 2020 as a result of a bitter feud with Sydney public relations guru Roxy Jacenko, who accused him of spray painting “Roxy is a c**t” outside her Paddington business. Mr Hess was also reportedly slapped by former bikie Toby Mitchell on a night out drinking in South Yarra.  Mr Hess’s next court date is listed for May 30.  Our Apps
