DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Liberty Energy Inc., (NYSE: LBRT; “Liberty” or the “Company”) announced today third quarter 2023 financial and operational results.

  
Summary Results and Highlights
 
“Liberty delivered excellent quarterly financial results reflecting outstanding operational execution, focused customer engagement and agility across a softer North American frac market. Record pumping efficiencies drove sequential growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA while idling one fleet during the quarter. The industry remained disciplined, championing steady pricing for quality services while withdrawing underutilized frac fleets from the market. Our superior execution combined with expanded vertical integration and technology investments culminated in a trailing 12-month Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed3 of 44%,” commented Chris Wright, Chief Executive Officer.

 
“Over the years, our investment decisions have increased our competitive advantage, driving value creation through technology, scale and vertical integration. Today, the latest piece in our digiTechnologies℠ suite is demonstrating impressive operating results. The commercial deployment of our proprietary digiPrime units commenced in late September, quickly becoming the crew and customer’s favorite technology on location. Our digiFrac℠ fleets deployed during the year reached new operating records, maximizing fuel efficiency with Liberty Power Innovations (“LPI”) CNG logistics and on-site management. We are on track to be operating four digiFleets by year end and six digiFleets by the end of January 2024. We are excited by the strong customer pull for our digiFleets and the enduring competitive advantages they bring to our portfolio,” continued Mr. Wright.

 
“Our returns-focused strategy centers on strong cash flow generation to fund compelling investments while returning cash to shareholders. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1% of our shares outstanding, or a cumulative 11% since our buyback reinstatement in July 2022.”

 
“Our investment in differential technologies and innovative businesses build on our competitive advantage and expand our market opportunities. We increased our quarterly cash dividend by 40% in response to the significant growth in our per share earnings and cash generating abilities from our business transformation over the last three years. We remain focused on maximizing the value of each Liberty share and driving higher total returns for years to come.”

 
Outlook
 
Frac industry dynamics are encouraging amidst moderating demand trends, as service prices have remained relatively steady while underutilized frac fleets exited the market. Fleets across the industry were idled in response to completions activity softness, supporting a better supply-demand balance of marketed fleets as compared to prior cycles. As the Shale Revolution matures, the industry has adapted to a new era in frac markets through consolidation, technological progress, disciplined investment and serving increasingly complex customer needs.

 
Frac activity has largely stabilized at current levels, representing a baseload of frac fleet demand needed to sustain E&P operators’ flattish production levels. Fourth quarter trends will likely see seasonal softness, winter weather, and holiday disruptions. We expect the recent strengthening of commodity prices will drive a modest increase in activity beginning in 2024.

 
Global oil and gas markets found firmer footing during the third quarter, driving higher oil and gas prices. Volatility in commodity markets has emerged from the possibility of an escalating conflict in the Middle East and renewed recessionary fears. Recognizing the elevated uncertainty, global oil industry production and demand trends infer that the delicate balance of oil and gas markets is tilted to the upside. The long-term demand outlook for secure North American energy anchors a more durable cycle. OPEC+ decisions, including the extension of Saudi Arabia’s production cuts, further demonstrate a willingness to support commodity prices, underpinning long-term investments in North American shale.

 
“Energy market fundamentals support positive momentum in North America resource development, leading to consolidation and investment amongst E&P operators focused on long term value creation. Liberty is uniquely positioned to support our customers’ ambitions to unlock value with our next generation technologies, integrated services, and scale. We are confident that our superior, reliable service quality better positions our customers to achieve higher capital and operating efficiencies to deliver durable returns,” commented Mr. Wright.

 
“Liberty teams outperformed in the third quarter despite industry activity headwinds, delivering significant operating efficiencies and attractive returns. Fourth quarter activity is expected to slow modestly on normal seasonality and the related impact on efficiency. For full year 2023, we expect Adjusted EBITDA will be at the high end of our guidance range of 30% to 40% growth over 2022,” continued Mr. Wright. “We continue to deliver superior returns and a differential service for our customers. Our commitment to excellence and focus on company culture, our next generation digiTechnologies suite, and LPI positions us well to compete in near-term cycles and over the long term.”

 
Share Repurchase Program
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, Liberty repurchased and retired 1,784,899 shares of Class A common stock at an average of $16.38 per share, representing 1.0% of shares outstanding, for approximately $29 million. Liberty has cumulatively repurchased and retired 10.6% of shares outstanding at program commencement on July 25, 2022. Total remaining authorization for future common share repurchases is approximately $211 million.

 
The shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, through block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, through derivative transactions or by other means in accordance with federal securities laws. The timing, as well as the number and value of shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including management’s assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock, the market price of the Company’s common stock, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, compliance with the Company’s debt and other agreements, applicable legal requirements, and other considerations. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by the Company is not guaranteed, and the program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The Company expects to fund the repurchases by using cash on hand, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and expected free cash flow to be generated through the authorization period.

 
Quarterly Cash Dividend
 
During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share of Class A common stock, or approximately $8 million in aggregate to shareholders.

 
On October 17, 2023, the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.07 per share of Class A common stock, to be paid on December 20, 2023 to holders of record as of December 6, 2023. This dividend represents a 40% increase from the prior quarter.

 
Future declarations of quarterly cash dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors and to the Board’s continuing determination that the declarations of dividends are in the best interests of Liberty and its stockholders. Future dividends may be adjusted at the Board’s discretion based on market conditions and capital availability.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
This earnings release includes unaudited non-GAAP financial and operational measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and ROCE. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial and operational measures provides useful information about our financial performance and results of operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as non-cash stock-based compensation, new fleet or new basin start-up costs, fleet lay-down costs, costs of asset acquisitions, gain or loss on the disposal of assets, bad debt reserves, transaction, severance, and other costs, the loss or gain on remeasurement of liability under our tax receivable agreements, the gain or loss on investments, and other non-recurring expenses that management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance.
 
Our board of directors, management, investors, and lenders use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization) and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP.
 
We define Adjusted Pre-Tax Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) as the ratio of pre-tax net income (adding back income tax and tax receivable agreement impacts) for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 to Average Capital Employed. Average Capital Employed is the simple average of total capital employed (both debt and equity) as of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. ROCE is presented based on our management’s belief that these non-GAAP measures are useful information to investors when evaluating our profitability and the efficiency with which management has employed capital over time. Our management uses ROCE for that purpose. ROCE is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income, as defined by U.S. GAAP
 
Non-GAAP financial and operational measures do not have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of non-GAAP financial and operational measures is not intended to be a substitute for, and should not be considered in isolation from, the financial measures reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See the tables entitled Reconciliation and Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures for a reconciliation or calculation of the non-GAAP financial or operational measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

During the second quarter of 2021, the Company entered into a three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss driven primarily by Covid-19 which, applying the interpretive guidance to Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740 - Income Taxes, required the Company to recognize a valuation allowance against certain of the Company’s deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company achieved three years of cumulative pre-tax income in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the Company’s net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future. For the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company recorded a release of the valuation allowance. In connection with both the recognition and release of a valuation allowance, the Company was also required to remeasure the liability under the tax receivable agreements.

Net capital expenditures presented above include investing cash flows from purchase of property and equipment, excluding acquisitions, net of proceeds from the sales of assets.
