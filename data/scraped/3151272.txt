Steadily improving from their England debacle, Argentina overcame surprise tactics of feisty Japan to book their place in the last eight of the Rugby World Cup.

                                         "Japan brought a good tactical plan to the match. They caused us problems in the front row and we had to adjust to that," coach Michael Cheika said after his Pumas' 39-27 victory at the Stade de la Beaujoire on Sunday. Argentina won the try count 5-3 in a match they always led after centre Santiago Chocobares went over inside the first minute. But Japan hit back every time the Pumas threatened to run away with the score until man-of-the-match Mateo Carreras completed a hat-trick of tries in the 68th minute and Argentina increased their winning margin in the closing minutes. Cheika was pleased to get another win under his belt. The Australian, a World Cup finalist in charge of the Wallabies in England in 2015, said he tends not to look at opponents and is more concerned with his own team's game but had a word about Warren Gatland's Wales team, who the Pumas face next. "Wales have had a real focus and stayed clean. I watched them against Australia. Gatland has a very particular style and has infused his team with it." Argentina will almost certainly be without former captain Pablo Matera against the Welsh after he came off midway through the first half with a hamstring injury.Â  The Pumas had been in better form than England before their opening pool clash a month ago but played poorly and have been on a run of matches they needed to win to hold onto their place in the tournament. "We've been seeking consistency of good performance, but Wales is another adversary that presents a different gameplan. Now we can tackle what follows with a new mentality."
