Travelers looking to use their airline miles to fly last-minute domestically can face an array of grim prospects. That’s especially true now that awards are tied to cash prices more closely than ever — and those cash prices tend to skyrocket within a few weeks of travel.  However, one program has been such a consistent source of last-minute deals for me that I now use its miles almost exclusively for booking domestic flights leaving within a few days: American Airlines AAdvantage.  » Learn more: How much are points and miles worth this year? American Airlines announced it was getting rid of award charts for its own flights in April 2023, which on the surface sounds like bad news but in practice didn’t change much, since they were already effectively using dynamic pricing.  In theory, that dynamic pricing extends to last-minute award pricing, which means that award prices should go up for last-minute fares.  Yet, in researching dozens of flights over the past couple of years, I’ve found American AAdvantage to be the only U.S.-based award program that consistently offers convenient, low-priced options within about a week of departure for domestic flights.  (Last-minute international award flights on American are another story.)  » Learn more: The complete guide to the American Airlines AAdvantage program Although these last-minute deals are priced attractively for members of American’s AAdvantage program, they generally can’t be booked using partner airline currencies such as British Airways Avios. To illustrate this, I selected four one-way routes: two over 2,000 miles, one under 1,000 miles and one in between. I chose the lowest-priced option in miles in any cabin class that left after 6:30 a.m. and arrived before 11 p.m., with at most a single connection between 45 minutes and 3 hours.  The comparison includes the four largest domestic airlines by market share: American, Delta, Southwest and United. This isn’t a comprehensive analysis, and other individual routes may vary from what I found, but these results more or less match what I've encountered when booking my own travel.  Across all four routes, American Airlines came out as the clear winner, with a 2.5 average cents per mile value, nearly double Southwest’s average value of 1.4 cents per mile.  The difference is even more stark when comparing the award costs themselves. American awards cost just over 11,000 miles per route, on average, which is a great deal for last-minute travel.  Delta Air Lines, on the other hand, charged more than 70,000 miles per route, on average.  Airline Average award cost Average cash cost Average value American Airlines 11,125 miles. $277. 2.5 cents per mile. Delta Air Lines 71,375 miles. $802. 1.1 cents per mile. Southwest Airlines 23,017 miles. $320. 1.4 cents per mile. United Airlines 31,850 miles. $377. 1.2 cents per mile. Here’s how each airline fared, broken out by route:  Route: Washington-National to San Diego (DCA-SAN). Date searched: April 24, 2023. For travel on: April 26, 2023. For this route, American had several relatively convenient options available for 10,500 miles one-way, and a progression of only slightly more expensive options after that. In contrast, Delta, Southwest and United required a minimum of 33,000 miles: Airline Award cost Cash cost Value American Airlines 10,500 miles. $451. 4.3 cents per mile. Delta Air Lines 39,000 miles. $449. 1.2 cents per mile. Southwest Airlines 33,107 miles. $453. 1.4 cents per mile. United Airlines 35,000 miles. $453. 1.3 cents per mile. Route: Seattle to Charleston, S.C. (SEA-CHS). Date searched: April 24, 2023. For travel on: April 28, 2023. Both in real cost (in miles) and in cents per mile, American was again the winner, though not by much in either case over Southwest. It’s a good reminder that it never hurts to shop around. Airline Award cost Cash cost Value American Airlines 16,000 miles. $265. 1.7 cents per mile. Delta Air Lines 122,500 miles. $1,350. 1.1 cents per mile. Southwest Airlines 18,591 miles. $265. 1.4 cents per mile. United Airlines 28,200 miles. $263. 0.9 cent per mile. Route: Las Vegas to Omaha (LAS-OMA), Neb. Date searched: April 24, 2023. For travel on: April 30, 2023. For this itinerary, American required less than half the number of miles compared with the next-closest airline, which in this case was Southwest. Its cash fares were also lower, which means the cent-per-mile values weren’t hugely different.  Airline Award cost Cash cost Value American Airlines 10,500 miles. $188. 1.8 cents per mile. Delta Air Lines 107,500 miles. $1,200. 1.1 cents per mile. Southwest Airlines 24,637 miles. $334. 1.4 cents per mile. United Airlines 47,300 miles. $583. 1.2 cents per mile. In this scenario, assuming you have miles available in its award currency, Southwest would be worth considering because it’s the only airline of the four offering a nonstop flight.  Route: Rochester, N.Y., to Richmond (ROC-RIC), Va. Date searched: April 24, 2023. For travel on: May 2, 2023. Again, American was the clear winner both in number of miles required (less than half the other three options) and the cent-per-point value you get using those miles: Airline Award cost Cash cost Value American Airlines 7,500 miles. $205. 2.7 cents per mile. Delta Air Lines 16,500 miles. $207. 1.3 cents per mile. Southwest Airlines 15,734 miles. $228. 1.4 cents per mile. United Airlines 16,900 miles. $207. 1.2 cents per mile. NerdWallet values American miles at 1.7 cents apiece, and in each of the above cases you’ll get at least as much value — in some cases far more value.  » Learn more: How much are my American Airlines miles worth?
