 We take a comprehensive look at the first Moto smartphone to carry Lenovo branding While the original Moto G rewrote many rules in the Indian smartphone market, a lot has changed since then. The market has become even more competitive, with not just Chinese brands in the fray, but international giants and Indian companies fighting it out intensely in order to garner market share. Lenovo has kept the pricing of both the variants of the G4 Plus quite competitive – Rs 13,499 for the 2GB RAM 16GB storage model, and Rs 14,999 for the 3GB RAM 32GB storage variant.The Lenovo Moto G4 Plus is up against stiff competition. Pictured here: Moto G4 Plus (left), Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (middle) and LeEco Le 1s Eco (right)However, the competition is cut-throat. To name a few, we have the MEIZU m3 note (first impressions), Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (review), LeEco Le 1s Eco (first impressions), Samsung Galaxy J7 (first impressions) and even Lenovo`s own ZUK Z1 (first impressions) – all of which pose a major threat to the Moto G4 Plus. However, most of them suffer from availability issues due to the flash sales model they follow.If there’s one thing which the Lenovo Moto G4 Plus lacks, it has to be a killer feature which will let consumers say ‘shut up and take my money’. The original Moto G played on the VFM factor, something which has become the turf of Chinese brands. The G4 Plus also doesn’t have the design advantages which its previous iteration boasted, and and it doesn’t have any software capabilities like the premium Moto X devices either – features like touchless control for example.Having said that, a good display, impressive cameras, a smooth performance and a day-long battery life is what the end user values – and the Lenovo Moto G4 Plus ranks high on all these factors. There’s also a fast and accurate fingerprint reader for enhanced security. Add to it the fact that it ships with the latest and pure build of Android, along with the promise that the next iterations of the platform will come as soon as they’re released, the deal becomes a lot sweeter.Summing it up, the Moto G4 Plus shows a promising sign of things to come under the tutelage of Lenovo, and as such can be taken as a change agent for the Chinese giant. It could also help in sealing the numero uno position for the brand in the smartphone market, just like its computer business.  Phone gets hang phone gets over heated while charging and using mobile lenovo has made Motorola down grade Motorola was better with Google company as compared to lenovo Please dnt buy this product from flipkart, they send defective products..
