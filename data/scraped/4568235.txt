 The Computer Software Assurance for Production and Quality System Software draft guidance stems from a multi-year collaboration between the FDA and industry. It identifies the common pain points and the FDA’s current thinking. The CSA guidance puts patient safety and product safety at the heart of the FDA assessment process. Watch our on-demand webinar with CSV specialist Darren Geaney “Achieving Computer Software Assurance with Digital Validation” to learn more about what the guidance means for validating computer systems. Following the launch of their “Case for Quality” initiative in 2011, the FDA was uncertain why so few companies were investing in automated solutions and why so many continued to run long-outdated versions of software. The initiative, which set out to study quality best practice in medical device manufacturing, found that the burden of Computer Systems Validation (CSV) deterred technology investments and, as a result, inhibited quality best-practice. The entire Life Sciences industry and the FDA joined forces and decided to take a collaborative approach on why it took so long to get a product to market and to validate software. The FDA then examined the traditional, document-driven Computer System Validation process and in September 2022 it issued its draft guidance on Computer Software Assurance for Production and Quality System Software which aims to enable a more effective and efficient risk-based approach to Computer System validation. Read this article to discover five things that you need to know about Computer Software Assurance (CSA):  ... to continue reading, head over to the full article on our Kneat blog.
