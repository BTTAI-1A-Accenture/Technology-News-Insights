Slaughterhouse has one of the biggest cult followings in Hip-Hop history, and their fans continue to look for any ray of light that could lead to a reunion and new music. As far as fans are privy to, the tough news is still a dividing line between two sides putting Joell Ortiz and Kxng Crooked on one side of the aisle and Joe Budden and Royce Da 5’9″ on another. Then add in that Joe is quite happy podding. Enter Just Blaze who gave fans the best shot they have at new music. Hitting Twitter, Just Blaze shared two unreleased singles. “I just found the slaughterhouse album,” Blaze wrote. “Jesus this is great. I might do the lords work.” In light of the death of DJ Mark The 45 King, more music can be on the way. You can see the messages from Just Blaze and hear the music below. 45 king didn’t die for us to hold on to a bunch of Music. More to come eventually.  just blazeslaughterhouse Shawn Grant is a Chicago native and the Senior Editor of The Source Magazine. He can only be found on Instagram and Twitter at @shawnxgrant.
