Today The Papua New Guinea Olympic Committee (“PNGOC”) is aware of the recent media publications regarding a complaint made to Police against weightlifter Dika Toua. The PNGOC is informed that Dika has engaged legal counsel, which is her Constitutional right. The PNGOC respects the Court’s processes and looks forward to a speedy resolution of this matter. Until such time as the matter is concluded, Dika remains part of Team PNG for the Tokyo 2021 Olympics. Dika has represented Papua New Guinea since 1998 and has won numerous medals for Papua New Guinea at Oceania and Commonwealth Championships, Pacific Games and Commonwealth Games. Dika created history at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 when she became the first female weightlifter to lift when the female weightlifting competition was contested for the first time at the Olympic Games. She is set on creating history again by being the first female lifter to compete at 5 Olympics when she competes in Tokyo in July. Dika was our Flag Bearer at the 2004 Athens Olympics Games and has always represented Team PNG and Papua New Guinea with distinction.  STAY INFORMED!
