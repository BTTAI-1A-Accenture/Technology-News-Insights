The process included site visits, scoring, and feedback from legal and industry experts.According to City Manager Ryan Monroe, one reason the process took so long was because of the voluminous amount of information each cannabis company submitted for review on the proposed location, financing and other details.Related Articles

Canna Square is the only one that won’t be on Groesbeck as the owners proposed their dispensary to be on Hayes Road, just south of 12 Mile Road.Councilmembers initially were only to approve five licenses, but when they saw some of the companies had the exact same final score, they amended the ordinance to allow six licenses.The council also awarded six licenses for processing and packaging the cannabis: Full Bloom, Vendco, Herbwealth, Crave, Lume, and Med Smart; along with five licenses for cultivation and one for micro business for smaller marijuana companies and former caregivers.

“They promised to come up with community benefits and other tasks if they got their licenses,” Huth said after the council meeting.“Jars indicated in its application a return to the community in the form of charitable donations and such,” he said. “It’s a binding contract with the city. It’s fair play for the communities to offer a benefit. The courts have upheld the fact that residents deserve to get something in return for the marijuana shops.”Mayor Robert Taylor acknowledged he opposed the legalization of cannabis, but he respects the fact voters approved legalizing it.Some safeguards the city put in place were keeping the shops more than 1,000 feet from schools and residential neighborhoods. In addition, the city will see development come to long-neglected buildings and Roseville will realize some revenue.“Some of these buildings are definitely in need of some repair. They’re putting their money into Roseville, so from that point of view, it’s a win-win situation,” Taylor said.Related Articles

But Taylor, a retired Macomb County Sheriff’s Office command officer, said he has some concerns. He hopes the dispensaries don’t place a burden on police, fire and other city employees.“I personally opposed legalizing marijuana because of the field and profession I was I in,” he said. “You’ve got people out there drinking and driving. Now you’re going to add people smoking marijuana and driving. You drive through the parking lot of a shopping center, and you certainly smell it.
