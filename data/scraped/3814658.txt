Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Friday he was grateful that the United States government decided to return more than 100 Indian antiquities that had been “stolen from us”. During an interaction with members of the Indian-American community at the Ronald Reagan Centre in Washington DC, Modi said, “I am happy that the American government has decided to return more than 100 Indian antiquities that had been stolen from us. These antiquities may have gotten to the international market in different ways – some legal, some illegal. I express my gratitude to the American government for returning these items.” The Indian Express had reported on March 14, following an investigation in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and UK-based Finance Uncovered, that the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York had at least 77 antiquities in its catalogue linked to jailed smuggler Subhash Kapoor. The Met said last month that 16 of these antiquities had been returned to India. In the second part of the investigation published on March 15, The Indian Express had reported that the Met’s formidable Asia collection included at least 94 artefacts of Jammu and Kashmir origin — 81 sculptures, five paintings, five pages of a manuscript, two Kashmir carpet antiquities and one page of calligraphy — none of which had details in their provenance, or background documents, of when they were moved out and by whom. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said in a reply dated June 15 to an RTI application filed by The Indian Express that “a mail has been received from the Ministry of External Affairs through the Ministry of Culture in the month of May 2023. All efforts are being taken to retrieve the art objects and the matter is in progress.” A senior ASI official said on Saturday that “authentication of around 120 Indian antiquities in the US is completed, and the authentication of more antiquities is underway. I can’t comment on which antiquities exactly are coming now and which will come later.” Days after The Indian Express published the reports on the antiquities in the Met’s catalogue, the New York Supreme Court on March 22 issued a search warrant against the museum, with Justice Felicia Mennin giving 10 days to the New York Police Department or any agent of the Department of Homeland Security to seize the antiquities and bring them before the court. On March 30, the museum issued a statement that it would “transfer 15 sculptures for return to the government of India, after having learned that the works were illegally removed from India”. It said that “all of the works were sold at one point by Subhash Kapoor, a dealer currently serving a prison sentence in India.” Museum director Max Hollein issued a statement on May 9, saying that “last month, in light of new provenance information, we returned 16 works to India, including the Celestial Dancer, a sculpture that enraptured visitors for decades”. The Met also announced an “intensive review of its collection”. The Celestial Dancer is an 11th-century sandstone sculpture of an “Apsara” from Madhya Pradesh. It is valued at more than $1 million. The sculpture was among those that had links to Kapoor, who is serving a 10-year prison term in Tamil Nadu. Antiquities that are returned are usually handed over to Indian authorities abroad — missions or High Commissions – after which the MEA informs the Ministry of Culture, which coordinates with the ASI, which is the custodian for such repatriated objects. The ASI then sends a team to verify and document the objects, following which a decision is taken about their physical return to India. A complaint filed in July 2019 in a New York court by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) had stated that the “total value of stolen antiquities known to have been trafficked by Kapoor exceeds $145.71 million”. Kapoor, described by the US Department of Homeland Security as “one of the most prolific commodities smugglers in the world”, was arrested in Frankfurt on October 30, 2011, and extradited to India in July 2012. On November 1, 2022, he was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a court in Tamil Nadu’s Kumbakonam on charges of burglary and illegal export of idols belonging to the Varadharaja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram. He is currently serving his sentence in Trichy jail. Kapoor faces charges in the US as well for smuggling idols and artefacts from Asia.
