Occidental Mindoro, the northern portion of Palawan, Western Visayas, the Zamboanga Peninsula, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi will experience cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms due to Habagat.  Partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms will prevail over Metro Manila and the rest of the country.  Flooding or landslides may occur due to inclement weather.  Luzon will experience moderate to strong winds with moderate to rough waters, while both Visayas and Mindanao will have light to moderate winds with slight to moderate waters.  The sun will rise over Metro Manila at 5:41 a.m. on Thursday. — Jiselle Casucian/VBL, GMA Integrated News
