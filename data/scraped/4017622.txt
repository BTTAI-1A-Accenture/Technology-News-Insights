 The global brokerage Gallagher has acquired Mavco Insurance Group (Mavco), a firm with offices in Perth and Adelaide. A Gallagher media release said Mavco’s speciality areas include construction, health, engineering, mining and financial services. “I was impressed with the Mavco team's client focus,” said Sarah Lyons (pictured above), Gallagher Australia CEO. “By joining forces, we’ll have an even more compelling proposition for businesses and organisations operating across Australia and internationally with Mavco bringing decades of industry knowledge and client relationships.” Lyons said her company is “pleased to continue investing in the Australian market.” The release said the acquisition is Gallagher Australia’s 10th during the last year. Jonathan Winter, co-founder and director of Mavco, said this merger is “great news” for his firm’s customers and “excellent” for employees. He said his staff can now access new career and development opportunities. The release said all Mavco employees are joining their Gallagher colleagues at that firm’s Perth and Adelaide offices. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. – that rebranded to Gallagher in 2017 – is a global consulting, insurance brokerage and risk management services firm headquartered in Rolling Meadows, Illinois.  The firm has a presence in 130 countries including Australia. Mavco was founded in 2016.
