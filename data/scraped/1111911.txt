Processing.... Air Force Materiel Command is establishing a new organization within the Air Force Sustainment Center to facilitate software engineering collaboration throughout the enterprise. The AFSC Software Engineering directorate will consolidate the three existing software engineering groups located at each of the Air Logistics Complexes in an effort to eliminate redundancy, improve the effectiveness of processes and prioritize the delivery of software. “This decision will align and integrate our software ecosystem capabilities to Air Force priorities and rapidly address the growth in volume and complexity of software-enabled DAF weapon systems,” said Lt. Gen. Shaun Morris, commander of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. Gen. Duke Richardson, commander of AFMC, said the new organization aligns with the command’s strategic plan and will enable seamless integration of other software factories in the future. Software engineering group employees will begin consolidating workload and resourcing decisions through the new organization. “This realignment will enable us to spread the workload and allow for an increased flow of idea-sharing. Working together to solve complex issues will greatly accelerate our capacity to support the warfighter,” said Michael Jennings, senior technical leader at the AFSC Software Engineering directorate.
