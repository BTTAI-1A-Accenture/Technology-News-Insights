"Walmart represents one of the most significant marketplaces in North America and WhyteSpyder's expertise here, while complementary to our existing Amazon focussed capabilities, will provide further growth opportunities for our existing measurement and execution offerings in this region. "Meanwhile, we are very pleased to see both editions of Money20/20 rebound strongly this year."   2024 © Sharecast.com. All rights reserved.
