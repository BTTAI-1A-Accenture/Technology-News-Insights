As a result, software development companies always bring innovative new features to market at a rapid pace. Agile development addresses all of these demands by emphasizing strong communication between commercial and IT teams, regular introductions of new models, and a focus on the product as a whole. However, executive ambitions for their increasingly vital digital platforms are constrained by financial constraints, a more competitive market, an abundance of novel applications, and urgent and necessary resource needs.
