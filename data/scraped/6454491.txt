Featuring Ameripolish’s SmartFloor Refinement System Abrasives and SR2 sealer, the entire process can be run wet so facilities can remain open during the day while floors are refreshed overnight. Ameripolish offers the SmartFloor 3-Step Recovery system for concrete applications. The system rejuvenates previously  polished concrete floors in three steps. Featuring Ameripolish’s  SmartFloor Refinement System Abrasives and SR2 sealer, the entire process can  be run wet so facilities can remain open during the day while floors are  refreshed overnight.  “As building service contractors (BSCs) continue to  look for new ways to differentiate themselves, polished concrete services like  these are key,” said Clint Howle, president, Ameripolish. “Our abrasives can be  made in any size or shape and used on any type of machine - traditional grinding  or polishing machines, refreshing machines and even power trowels can all  utilize the SmartFloor abrasives.” SmartFloor Refinement System abrasive pads feature composite resin abrasive technology. The custom-made grinding  and polishing rings are installed with Velcro head attachments and come  in a variety of sizes.  The SR2 penetrating stain-resistant sealer is also  used in the 3-Step Refresh. The sealer is formulated to protect  polished concrete flooring from oil, water-based stains or acidic etching  agents like vinegar. SR2 is safe for high-traffic areas while allowing for the  use of the SmartFloor blue daily maintenance pads to maintain the floor without  degrading the stain protection, maintaining the desired aesthetic and necessary  stain resistance.    “Our goal is to provide BSCs with systems that are  easy to use and optimize labor while offering new areas to grow their  business,” added Howle. “With this recovery system, dull, worn and etched  concrete is refreshed to a beautiful, highly reflective finish without  disrupting business.”
