Colorado is great and all, but North Carolina gets the win in this mountain tourism category. Highlands, a popular resort getaway located in the southwestern part of the state, was tabbed as "America's Best Small Mountain Town" in a recent Travel + Leisure article. "Highlands is a summer retreat for those looking to escape the humidity and a year-round haven for hiking, waterfall spotting, art, music, and top-tier dining and hospitality experiences," the article said. The town is home to a permanent population of right around 1,000, but is known to host large populations of tourists throughout the year. The Cullasaja River and Dry Falls are popular nature attractions, and Old Edwards Inn draws in guest for its upscale yet cozy amenities. Asheville is about a 2-hour drive from Highlands, while Helen, Georgia — a popular mountain getaway just across the state border — is about a 1.5-hour drive.
