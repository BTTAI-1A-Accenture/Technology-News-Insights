To showcase the diversity and impact of IoT, we asked 13 industry leaders and experts to share their best examples of the Internet of Things. From RFID tags for luggage tracking to identity and access management, these professionals provide a comprehensive look at the most innovative and transformative IoT applications across various industries.   As a frequent traveler, it is such a hassle when my luggage gets lost. With multiple connecting flights and several destinations, sometimes it’s difficult to know which airport or airline to contact.  Now, through RFID tags implemented in some airports, luggage can be easily tracked. The handling of luggage is also made easier, which eases long lines in checking in the bags.  For instance, Delta has already implemented the RFID tracking chip for luggage. Travelers can easily track their luggage through the Fly Delta app. Mark Damsgaard, Founder and Head of Client Advisory, Global Residence Index   One of the best examples of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the smart home ecosystem. In a smart home, various devices and systems are interconnected through the internet, enabling automation, control, and monitoring of household functions.  For instance, smart thermostats can adjust temperature settings based on occupancy and weather, smart lighting systems can be controlled remotely or programmed for energy efficiency, and smart security systems can provide real-time alerts and video surveillance.  These connected devices communicate with each other, collect data, and provide users with convenience, energy savings, enhanced security, and improved overall home management. The smart home exemplifies how IoT technology is transforming our daily lives by creating a seamlessly interconnected environment. Josh Amishav, Founder and CEO, Breachsense   I’ve really enjoyed IoT home security systems and locks, which are typically part of a package deal. These products existed prior to their IoT incarnation, but the IoT nature allows every aspect of their operation to be federated by an application that my spouse and I have on our phones.  The result is significant. We can let people in the home when we’re not there and turn off accidental alarms triggered by the kids. We can also create new, temporary guest codes. All thanks to taking existing technology and placing it in the frame of IoT. Trevor Ewen, COO, QBench   I have built a house from scratch and I thought a lot about IoT in my home. We could find tons of IoT solutions on Amazon or AliExpress, but mostly they seemed useless to me. We live in Ukraine, where winters can be really wild.  What really helped me at home is automating the heating regulation. I have an electric boiler that heats water in a circuit in the floor, and a control panel, which is connected to a temperature sensor in each room. I can connect to the control panel via a mobile app.  The control panel closes the faucets in the corresponding room, depending on the set temperature via the mobile app. It also allows me to control the central temperature of the electric boiler. That’s the most helpful thing for me, as I can see whether the children’s room is warm enough and can adjust its temperature from anywhere with an internet connection. Maksym Hlukhovtsov, Co-founder, BakeBreadBeCool   Automotive connectivity is one of the greatest IoT instances that has triggered a transformative change in the industry. Connected cars make life easier for both drivers and manufacturers, allowing for over-the-air software updates and enhancing vehicle performance. Connected cars are also marked ‌miniaturized electronics as OEMs now need to shrink modules and components to plug more embedded processing functions into the connected vehicles.  The proliferation of automotive connectivity has also generated more demand for more complex and powerful domain control units that solve the limitations of ECU architectures. Unlike ECUs, DCUs can be easily integrated into the vehicle while offering better security and core computing. Automotive connectivity also spells opportunities for the app development industry, as mobile applications have become the core element for IoT vehicle remote control. Tatsiana Kirimava, CEO and Founder, Orangesoft   Smart Agriculture is one of the best examples of IoT in action. It uses sensors, smart devices, and advanced analytics to optimize crop yields, conserve resources, and reduce costs.  The IoT-based smart farming systems enable farmers to monitor the conditions of crops in real-time, such as soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and more, and take corrective actions whenever necessary.  This helps farmers to increase the efficiency of their operations, minimize waste, and improve their overall productivity. IoT-powered Smart Agriculture solutions also help to reduce the environmental impact of farming practices, thus promoting more sustainable and eco-friendly practices. Jefferson McCall, Co-founder and HR Head, TechBullish   In the fitness industry, the IoT helps personal trainers get a better view of their client’s performance and progress. People who wear smartwatches, like Apple, Samsung, Garmin, or Fitbits, can provide a tremendous amount of data to their trainers, including fitness habits, sleep patterns, and heart rate metrics.  These can inform training cycles, including more rigorous training during low-stress times and lighter workouts during periods of high stress. Apps for food logging can help trainers provide nutrition advice, and Alexa or Google Home playlists can give a trainer the perfect motivation for a great workout.  Finally, electronic training plans or apps can make it easy to communicate so that clients can stay on track between sessions. Erny Peibst, Founder and CEO, Inside Bodybuilding   IoT can enhance the inventory management process by using automation and advanced tracking. It’s far more efficient than manual processes and gives you better insight into how your inventory is being handled and processed.  You can always have an up-to-date look at your inventory without having to wait for a new report to be pulled manually because it tracks changes in real time. It can also use predictive analytics to forecast demand and help manage inventory levels based on trends and predictions. Corey Donovan, President, Alta Technologies   As a personal trainer, I believe a standout example of IoT is fitness wearables. These gadgets revolutionized how we approach health and fitness by providing real-time data and insights. I recall a client who had issues with sleep and recovery. Thanks to her fitness tracker, we could identify patterns in her sleep habits and make necessary adjustments to her routine. The result was better sleep quality and a significant improvement in her overall performance. In addition, IoT has advanced home workouts with smart fitness equipment. For example, a smart treadmill can adjust its incline to simulate outdoor terrain, enhancing the training experience. These innovations make fitness more accessible and personalized, truly showcasing the power of IoT. Evander Nelson, NASM-Certified Personal Trainer, evandernelson   One of the best examples of IoT today is in Smart City projects around the world, like Barcelona or Singapore. These cities have deployed thousands of interconnected devices as part of their vision for creating more efficient societies by improving public services and ensuring a better quality of life for their citizens.  Examples include street lighting, waste management systems, connected traffic lights, air quality sensors, and citizen safety initiatives—all connected over a single network that can be centrally optimized resources while cutting down on energy costs. Travis Lindemoen, Managing Director, nexus IT group   I recently explained IoT to a potential customer concisely using Automotive IoT as an example. Modern car technology represents examples of both centralized and decentralized IoT systems. The decentralized IoT system would be the vehicles and sensors within the vehicle acting together to make driving safer. For example, most new vehicles have assistive emergency braking.  They use lidar and other distance sensors to tell if the driver is approaching a vehicle too quickly. Then, they provide direct feedback to the braking system to stop the vehicle, while also providing feedback to the warning system to alert the driver. The centralized IoT system would be the OnStar or proprietary roadside assistance system employed by the vehicle. The vehicle feeds the sensor data (GPS, emergency systems, etc.) back to a central entity/server which then acts as an orchestrator of other systems to communicate back to the vehicle or with other entities (emergency responders). Daniel Krentz, VP of Product and Operations, Wireless Data Systems, Inc.   One of the most striking examples of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the evolution of supply chain management into a “Smart Supply Chain”. I speak from my experience as we’ve integrated IoT technologies into our solar solutions business operations.  Specifically, our inventory management has been revolutionized. Sensors on our solar panels send real-time updates about their status, and we’re able to maintain an accurate record of our stock levels.  This system allows us to expect demand and streamline our procurement process. This interconnectedness of our processes has created a supply chain that’s more efficient and more transparent. Therefore, from personal experience, I can attest that Smart Supply Chain Management is a standout instance for IoT applications. Ben McInerney, Founder and Director, GoSolarQuotes   Identity and access management (IAM) are now possible thanks to the seamless integration of IoT and cloud technology. By connecting IoT devices to the cloud, organizations can leverage cloud-based services such as Amazon Cognito or Auth0 to manage user identities securely and access across multiple platforms.  With this technology, companies can easily create, manage, and secure user accounts by providing passwordless authentication with biometric recognition or one-time passwords.  IAM technology allows machine-to-machine authentication and authorization processes to ensure that only allowed devices are granted access to protected resources. This critical advancement in security helps organizations protect sensitive customer data and prevent unauthorized access.
