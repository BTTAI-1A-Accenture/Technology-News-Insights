Payhawk, the leading spend management solution for domestic and international businesses throughout Europe, US and UK is today launching a new emergency Visa credit card for businesses with zero-interest rate and 60 days payment terms available to businesses in the US and UK. If you need to open a bank account or gain access to a Visa credit card to pay immediate expenses, you can submit your application request to emergency-credit-card@payhawk.com and the Payhawk team will prioritize your application immediately. “We are eager to provide this product to businesses in need as we have been monitoring the situation with Silicon Valley Bank since Thursday. It was extremely important for us not to take advantage of the situation and contribute to the bank run on Thursday and Friday, but now that there is a real risk of a cash crunch at businesses on Monday, we wanted to ensure that we can help those businesses given our strong position as a company in the space,” said Hristo Borisov, Co-founder & CEO at Payhawk. Payhawk is the leading spend management solution for domestic and international businesses throughout Europe, US and UK. Combining company cards, reimbursable expenses accounts payable and seamless accounting software integrations into a single product, Payhawk makes business payments easy — for everyone.
