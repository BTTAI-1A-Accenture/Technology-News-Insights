FOLLOW DEVELOPING TELECOMS  Allo Technology is implementing Infinera’s ICE-X intelligent coherent pluggables and XTM Series to boost its nationwide optical network and expand services across Malaysia. ICE-X provides Allo with a cost-effective and operationally seamless method of significantly increasing network capacity while enabling the delivery of new enhanced services to its customers. Planned network deployments include point-to-multipoint network architectures utilising the wide range of deployment options of Infinera’s ICE-X intelligent coherent pluggables and the XTM platform. The inclusion of point-to-multipoint architectures brings further network economics benefits with reduced network capital expenditure and reduced network operating expenditure through lower space and power requirements and dramatic network simplification. Allo, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), is the first operator in the region to deploy  Infinera's ICE-X coherent pluggables technology. The Allo Carrier Network System (ACNS) is the optical backbone for Malaysia, providing direct connectivity with broad coverage spanning the peninsula. Allo remains focused on its ACNS to identify innovative ways to enhance and maximise its network assets to offer customers cost-efficient, high-capacity next-generation services that are competitive and scalable.
