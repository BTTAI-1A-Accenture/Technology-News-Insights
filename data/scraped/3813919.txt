				 Methodology ​​Our credit cards team has spent hours analyzing hundreds of credit cards. We took a deep dive into the details of each product and that analysis, combined with our years of experience covering credit cards, informed us as we developed these credit card rankings. Factors we considered included: American Express cards are typically high cost and high reward credit cards. If you use an Amex card wisely, it can deliver a lot of value. American Express cards generally require good credit to qualify. You can check to see which cards you might qualify for by searching for your matched offers through Amex. Amex makes these pre-qualified offers based on your recent credit history and income, and your credit scores aren’t impacted by the process.  If you don’t get matched for a card you want, you may need some time to improve your credit scores or increase your income before you apply. Alternatively, you might want to look for a different card issuer that has more flexible qualification requirements. It’s easy to get pre-qualification and preapproval confused, but they don’t mean the same thing. For credit cards, prequalification usually means you can potentially qualify based on unverified information you provide to the creditor. Preapproval is a little more firm, but it’s still not a guarantee you’ll be approved or receive the terms you see in the offer. Before a creditor like Amex sends you a preapproval offer, they verify some or all of your information, such as your credit history. But they still need to review your full credit card application before approving you for a card. Using an American Express card can earn you major rewards. To find the best Amex card for you, choose a card that rewards you for the purchases you already make. For example, if you frequently stay at Marriott Bonvoy hotels, the Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant® American Express® Card (terms apply) could deliver big value.  Amex splits their cards into three main categories: Even if one of these categories aligns with your spending, don’t assume a specific card will be worth the annual fee. Before applying, check to see which points, cash-back rewards or credits you’re most likely to qualify for and make sure they outweigh the cost of carrying the card. Some American Express cards give you Amex membership Rewards points for your spending. To earn points, your card has to be enrolled in the rewards program. If your card isn’t automatically enrolled, you can complete that step by calling the number on the back of the card.  Once you start earning them, you can redeem your Amex points in a variety of ways, including for: The value of rewards points depends on how you redeem them. You can use the Amex rewards calculator to estimate the redemption value before spending your points. American Express has a wide variety of credit cards, so their cards can be right for a lot of people. To find the best card for your needs, take a look at how you already spend money and search for a card that rewards your biggest areas of spending. Amex cards generally aren’t a fit for people with low credit scores, since you’re not likely to qualify if you have a FICO Score below 670. Using an Amex card can also be risky if you have issues with credit card debt or sticking to a budget, since their high rewards can encourage excessive spending.
