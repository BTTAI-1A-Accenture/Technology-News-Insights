   At ISC West 2023, Premio showcases how Rugged Edge Computing can easily stand up to the toughest industrial workloads in the harshest environments without missing a beat. Many trends are shaping the modern security market with a strong focus on rugged hardware such as smart sensors. There is a shift away from the cloud to IOT sensors which feature lidar, high-resolution cameras and cutting-edge technology. The sensors are providing the needed data so now it’s time to focus on hardware acceleration with new architecture to deliver AI analytics. Premio has used its 35 years of industrial engineering, reliability, and mechanical engineering to create Rugged Edge Computing. The computer technology is designed to be used in the toughest environments, such as those found in industrial settings, military applications, or outdoor installations. It has the ability to withstand extreme temperatures, dust, water, wind, and other environmental factors that could potentially damage or compromise traditional computing systems. In an effort to continue to future-proof security, Premio remains focused on X 86 computing by deploying solutions that grow effectively alongside the industry. X 86 acts as a solid foundation and when coupled with Rugged Edge Computing can easily shoulder industrial workloads in the most challenging environments. Premio Rugged Edge Computing devices are designed to be highly reliable and durable, even in the toughest conditions. They are built to withstand shock and vibration, as well as exposure to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). This makes them ideal for use in applications where traditional computing systems would be prone to failure or malfunction.
One of the key benefits of Premio Rugged Edge Computing is its ability to operate in remote or off-grid locations. The technology can be used to collect and process data in real-time, without requiring a constant connection to a centralized computing system. This makes it an ideal choice for applications such as oil and gas exploration, mining, and other industries that require on-site data processing capabilities. In addition, Premio Rugged Edge Computing supports a wide range of peripherals and sensors. This technology is designed to be highly flexible, allowing it to work with a variety of different sensors, cameras, and other devices. Hands down, it is the ideal choice for applications that require complex data collection and analysis. Dustin Seetoo, Director of Product Marketing at Premio, paints a picture of how edge AI is essential for rugged edge computing while also examining the reshaping of the modern security market.
