Krista Software's recent survey indicates that despite increasing familiarity with AI, Americans remain hesitant to rely on it for crucial decision-making
 DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Krista Software, a pioneer in AI integration technology, has unveiled the results of its 2023 AI Trust Survey. The nationwide survey demonstrates that while most Americans are now aware of artificial intelligence (AI), their understanding of how it works varies greatly depending on factors such as age and job position. Furthermore, despite being open to AI handling specific tasks, respondents displayed strong reluctance to trust AI with decisions that could significantly impact their lives.

  
Considering the surge in AI-related news coverage and Krista Software's commitment to providing an innovative AI integration platform (AI iPaaS), the company surveyed 1,000 adults from across the United States to gauge their current knowledge, sentiments, and trust in AI for performing tasks and making critical decisions.

Business leaders must understand this and deploy AI in a way that they can build trust in AI decisions.‚Äù
