 MTN Nigeria has decided to cancel its tower deal with IHS in Nigeria, and American Tower Corporation (ATC) will assume responsibility for MTN’s tower operations in the country. MTN Nigeria today informed its investors that the leases for approximately 2,500 network sites, currently serviced by IHS Nigeria Limited, are set to expire in 2024 and 2025. In accordance with MTN Nigeria’s procurement policy, the telecommunications company is committed to ensuring a transparent and competitive bidding process for these tower contracts. Consequently, MTN Nigeria initiated a tender process for these contracts. MTN stated that after a thorough evaluation of the bids received for tower services for these sites, ATC Nigeria Wireless Infrastructure Solutions Limited (ATC) emerged as the preferred tower company based on the superior nature of their bid submission. Furthermore, MTN highlighted that this decision to transition to ATC as their tower service provider for these sites in 2025 will not only diversify their site portfolio but also align with their proactive efforts to renegotiate tower agreements. These efforts aim to secure terms that can help mitigate the effects of the volatile trading environment in which they operate.
