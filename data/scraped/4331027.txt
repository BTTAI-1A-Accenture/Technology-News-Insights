It is now crucial to redirect sustainability efforts in the sector towards more effective interventions. US cities are regulating private use of technology more actively than the federal government, but the likely effects of this phenomenon are unclear. City lawmaking could make up for national regulatory shortfalls, but only if cities can thread the needle of special interests and partisanship. Borrowing the format of public competitions from engineering and computer science, a new type of challenge in 2023 tested real-world AI applications with legal assessments based on the EU AI Act. Access to prosthetic and orthotic devices remains limited in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to the lack of manufacturing and specialized healthcare facilities, and the limited access to skilled, certified medical personnel. Rise Bionics makes devices with digital fabrication and access-conscious engineering to increase accessibility and affordability. At the LV Prasad Eye Institute in India, we developed an ophthalmic electronic medical record and hospital management system, integrating clinical, surgical and operational functions in one platform to allow digital eye care services at the point of care.
