 REDX is a bit unique in that it provides you access to expired leads, geo-based leads, FSBO leads and pre-foreclosure leads. It does this by curating public data from listings in your area. Because REDX chases leads that aren’t necessarily looking for your help, you might have a harder time converting them. That said, the opportunity to cash in on these lesser-known segments is ripe if you’re persuasive. REDX makes sure all lists that it provides you aren’t on the Do Not Call list, so you won’t be breaking any laws by reaching out. All leads are automatically added to Vortex, which is REDX’s CRM. It provides you with custom scripts so you know exactly what to say to tough customers. Learn more: Read our full REDX review. Who should use it:  Agents who are looking to cast a wider net with their lead prospects will appreciate the bottom-of-the-barrel approach of REDX—but just be aware, it might be more of a grind to convert these leads.

 Zillow is the biggest real estate site on the web, and that’s how Zillow Premier Agent sources its leads. Unlike other companies where you buy real estate leads, Zillow Premier Agent doesn’t actually provide you with any contacts. Instead, it promotes you on individual listing pages, allowing the customer to reach out first. When they do, you’ll be the only agent they see on the site for 30 days—a feature called My Agent. Each showcase advertising page on Zillow has the space for three agents, meaning that if you live in a ZIP code without a lot of competition, you could easily be featured all the time. However, in crowded markets, you’ll need to spend more on advertising to get yourself featured. When you do get a client match, the Zillow CRM provides you with reminders, custom notes and access to their saved homes. Learn more: Read our full Zillow Premier Agent review. Who should use it:  Buyers’ agents who want to advertise in specific areas and don’t enjoy cold calling leads will appreciate Zillow’s approach of having clients contact you first.

 The Offrs AI technology uses over 250 points of data to predict which homeowners will be the most likely to list their home in the next year. If that sounds too good to be true, the company claims it predicted 72% of all listings in the U.S. last year—meaning it offers a good opportunity to be the first agent a seller talks to. To start, you’ll just select your territory by neighborhood or ZIP code. You’ll then see contact info for all of your leads, sorted by the category they fall into (predictive sellers, FSBO, expired listing and social media). You’re then able to reach out via Offrs integrated email marketing, online advertising or direct mail tools. Who should use it:  Agents who want to rely on predictive analysis technology rather than PPC marketing to buy real estate leads should try Offrs. It’s also good for agents who want to be first in the door to potential sellers. Price per lead  $309 per month

 To start the lead generation process, Zurple first creates your branded home search website for every target area you choose (you can have up to ten). You can then purchase additional search engine marketing services from Zurple or pull in your own leads from Zillow or other sources. Once your leads are curated, Zurple then analyzes their search history so you can learn more about how to engage them. It will then send out email conversations on your behalf based on the lead’s behavioral history. For example, it tracks if a lead views the same property multiple times, favorites a property or conducts general searches about home buying. Finally, Zurple can set appointments for you to finally meet your leads in person and see homes. Who should use it:  Agents who want to ditch automated email templates and instead have personalized email templates based on a lead’s actual wants will love Zurple’s Conversations feature. When considering the best sites to buy real estate leads, we considered the features agents would find most valuable, such as lead quality and automation. Sites that offered qualified, warm leads ranked higher than those where leads were cold and would take a lot of persuasive prowess to convert. Additionally, since automation is such a powerful tool for agents on the grind, this also was a major consideration. Automation includes any feature that sends out marketing text, emails or calls on your behalf, so you can spend your valuable time elsewhere. Naturally, price also played a big role in how we ranked our top choices. If a service didn’t seem to provide enough value for its cost, this hurt its ranking. Extra features, such as an included CRM or personalized customer support, also helped us round out our list of top lead buying sites. If a service went beyond providing leads, we considered this a plus. Choosing a real estate lead generator often comes down to price. You want a service that pays for itself in the end. If it’s too expensive upfront, you may not be able to offset your costs unless you commit to using the service long term. However, sometimes more expensive services are worth it, especially if they include full CRM software. You’ll also want to consider whether or not the service offers exclusive leads or not. With nonexclusive leads, you’ll need to be fast—and persuasive—to score a client’s business. The ability to focus your lead buys in a specific neighborhood or ZIP code is also important for building your expertise in a certain locality. Some services do all of the messaging for you automatically, which can be a huge time saver, especially if you’re already working with other clients. But always dig in and see how a service makes contact—commonly, it’s email, but it’s also possible to get text messaging or phone marketing as well. Try to find a service that matches your preferred contact method so the client can learn what to expect when working with you.

However, even veteran agents can benefit from some new leads if times are slow. If you want to buy real estate leads, any of these services will likely have something to offer. Which one is right for you all depends on your exact needs and budget. Many agents find it worth it to pay for real estate leads. That’s because the average Realtor commission is usually at least a few thousand dollars. This commission more than offsets the couple hundred dollars a month you might pay for leads. You can get leads for real estate by using any of the top lead-buying companies we list here. But if you don’t want to pay for leads, you could try asking for referrals from your current clients. Most lead-buying companies charge a few hundred a month for their services, but you may need to pay additional fees for advertising or when you close on a lead successfully. Costs often vary depending on the market you’re working in. Real estate generators earn their money in one of three ways. They can offer leads to real estate agents and brokers for a monthly fee upfront, make them available for free but receive a referral fee for leads that end up turning into sales, or a combination of the two methods. When you’re first starting out, it can be hard to get clients as a real estate agent. However, as long as you provide excellent services along with superior support, your clients should recommend you to others, bulking up your client roster.
