 The final days of the delegation focussed on the broad mechanics of setting up a business in Ireland. One tip we learned is that establishing a bank account in Ireland can be tricky. Sarah Colfer, Director of Company Secretarial Services at Mazars in Ireland, took us through the key steps to incorporate an entity in Ireland (noting that an entity in Ireland must have either at least one EEA resident director or can pay an insurance bond). Thanks to Cormac Kelleher, International Tax Partner, Mazars in Ireland, for addressing our enthusiastic questions around tax considerations (please do seek your own advice of course!):    Funding and Support:      – €1.3B 2022 total investment (flat/declining – Q4 22 47% decline!).      – ~40% life sciences.      – 200-300 deals per year.      – Deals under €10M/ seed are challenging.   Denis Curran, Head of Regions, Property and Enterprise Development from IDA Ireland kindly welcomed the delegation and took us through the objectives and outcomes. IDA is funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and promotes Ireland across the world, targeting foreign direct investment. They support companies who want to establish themselves in Ireland. The services are free and confidential, and they can provide information on tax and financial incentives, connection to partners, especially for research and development, and even support with physical space and office funding. They currently serve 1800 companies. For Australians, there is a contact in Australia, Deirdre Buckley, and companies are encouraged to reach out to her to understand the support available to enter Ireland. Ibec is the largest trade organisation in Ireland, representing 70% of the private sector workforce. They are a unique policy organisation in that are a unity of 40 trade organisations so are able to work genuinely across sectors. The Irish MedTech Association represents over 95% of the employment in the sector, and alongside the big multinationals, 60 to 70% of the members are SMEs. For start-up companies that want to join Ibec, there is also a “small firms plus” initiative.  Ibec is responsible for informing the strategy for Ireland to maintain its reputation as a global Medtech and Eoghan Ó Faoláin, Deputy Director of the Irish Medtech Association, was able to explain to us the differences in the various departments' focus. The Department of Enterprise would focus on digital health policy focusing on business, jobs and exports, while the Department of Health would focus on digital health policy benefiting patients. The Disruptive Technologies Industry Fund (DTIF) does fund digital health.  Skills remain a key focus. Jennifer McCormack, Network Manager at Connected Health Skillnet, was kind enough to take us through a recent report on the digital health skills gaps commissioned with HealthXL, outlining the plan to address the 1900 digital health-specific roles needed in areas including regulatory, cyber security, digital therapeutics, market access, software development, advanced data analytics. The proposed solution is a strategic government-supported micro-credentialing framework. Ireland follows the European medical device regulation MDR requirements which are certified by Notified Bodies throughout Europe. Emer Sherry, Senior Executive, took us through some recent history, deadlines and challenges: In response to changes in MDR following some safety incidents, changes originally flagged in 2017 and envisioned to be mandatory by 2021 have now been extended (see timeline below):   Emer assured us that this will improve as notified bodies increase their efficiency and comfort with the updated regulations and address their own staff shortages. However, structural issues with MDR remain:   Also, there are regulations to be aware of that are not yet mandated but coming in the pipeline:   Finally, a delegation to Dublin would not be complete without a visit to Trinity College Dublin! We started with a briefing in the Business School to learn about Trinity’s role in the Irish Digital Health Ecosystem. John Whelan, ICT Commercialization Manager, Trinity Innovation, started us off by providing a quick history and overview of Trinity College and took us through the Trinity Healthcare Leadership Hub within the Executive Education Department. He reminded us that Trinity is a great place for digital health entrepreneurs, with the university “being more open than ever to having conversations with digital health companies and the wider community” – with world-class research infrastructure and commercialisation support programs available for spins out. Aoife Fitzpatrick, Employer and Industry Engagement at Trinity College, provided an excellent overview of the Business School landscape at Trinity. In the past six years, Trinity has spun out 26 companies, including within the life sciences and medtech sectors.
