 Despite macroeconomic concerns, new car sales in the US are likely to rise in 2023. Therefore, quality auto stocks PT Astra (PTAIY) and Penske Automotive Group (PAG), which are showing high performance, could be ideal investments now. Let's discuss this in detail. The auto industry is evolving as it adapts to growing market demands and challenges associated with electric, autonomous, and hybrid vehicles. Despite the near-term challenges, vehicle sales might witness stable growth this year. Therefore, investing in auto stocks PT Astra International Tbk (PTAIY) and Penske Automotive Group, Inc. (PAG), which have demonstrated high performance, could be wise. Sales of new vehicles in the United States increased by 18.4% in March 2023 compared to February 2023 and by 8.7% compared to March 2022, when supply chains hampered output.

The 1-million-unit improvement from a dismal 13.8 million units sold in 2022 can be due to several factors, including sustained supply chain recovery and electric vehicle (EV) growth.
