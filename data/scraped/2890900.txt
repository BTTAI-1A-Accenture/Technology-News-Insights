 By Brian Garrett, product manager, Datapult; Millie Malai, technical project manager, Datapult; and Patina Zarcone, director, Datapult Next generation sequencing (NGS) is heralded as the frontier in public health surveillance. Today, new technologies capable of analyzing pathogen genomes are unlocking positive outcomes for public health. In 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched its Data Modernization Initiative (DMI) positing five priorities; among them is "accelerating data into action." Hundreds of millions of dollars have been allocated to support public health, data modernization and surveillance efforts. Meanwhile, NGS data analytics programs have been generally out of reach for public health, with software and pipeline support focusing on more lucrative markets.  Datapult, an APHL company, recognized public health's dire need for technological modernization upon its creation in 2020. Utilizing APHL proficiency, and a group of public health bioinformaticians, Datapult got to work on its NGS suite of services.  While evaluating existing solutions, it was discovered that no single, off-the-shelf solution would meet public health's requirements. What is needed is a secure, trusted, cloud-based NGS data pipeline management system that could allow organizational hierarchy as well as inter-organizational collaboration; a sandbox environment for innovation and a simple launchpad for daily analytics. The catch? To operate within the functions of public health and utilize existing analytics programs, an individual requires an exceedingly rare combination of bioinformatics expertise and serious programming chops.  The solution is complex in its simplicity--break up the minimum requirements. For Datapult, that meant splitting the "work" and leaning on the expertise of three parties. Datapult's NGS InSight is the result of a collaboration with Seqera and Two Bulls, leveraging three expertly developed elements.  Seqera's Nextflow Core and Tower addresses pipeline management and organizational needs by simplifying the writing and deployment of compute and data-intensive pipelines, is scalable and agnostic. State bioinformaticians can easily create, share and manage reliable and reproducible scientific workflows. Easy Genomics, implemented by Two Bulls, is a graphic user interface that plugs into Tower and removes much of the technical complexity for easy system administration and automation. It further automates Tower, making a great NGS analysis tool even easier to utilize in daily capacities and amplifies InSight's capabilities. Lastly, Datapult's utilization of the APHL Informatics Messaging Services (AIMS) platform provides a cloud platform for housing a public health-centered NGS analysis solution.  AIMS is a cloud platform strictly maintained to the security protocols governed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); earning it FISMA Moderate compliance and inherited FedRAMP controls. Rigorous HIPAA compliance for other services on AIMS means that NGS InSight benefits from the scrutiny and protections necessary for guaranteeing the privacy of private health information.  As an extension of InSight, NGS TB Pipeline permits access to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis analysis pipeline created by the New York State Deparemnt of Health Wadsworth Center. This pathogen genome analysis pipeline predicts drug resistance for M. tuberculosis isolates for clinical reporting. The pipeline was originally deployed on APHL's AIMS Platform in a proof-of-concept pilot project managed by the APHL Infections Disease Program.  NGS TB Pipeline has incorporated lessons learned from the pilot's proof-of-concept to enhance its new configuration and onbaroding process. The white-glove onboarding process ensures that there is the right technical support from kickoff to go-live. Access to this M. tuberculosis pipeline is available exclusively through Datapult.  Datapult's NGS InSight & NGS TB Pipeline are easy, secure ways to access pre-packaged pipelines and workspaces tailored to public health sequencing needs. NGS InSight's value is the ability to efficiently analyze pathogen genomces, enabling laboraratories to recognize differences in a pathgoen's genotypes. That information is actionable in protecting public health. Datapult's vision for the future of NGS InSight includes adding functionality for sharing data across states or with other partners.
