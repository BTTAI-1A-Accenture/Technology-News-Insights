 Global reinsurance broker Gallagher Re has announced the appointment of Andres Posada (pictured above) as executive vice president and head of sales for the Latin America and Caribbean region. Based in Miami, Posada will report to Edson Wiggers, CEO of Latin America and Caribbean, and will be responsible for leading the region's sales operations and driving revenue growth. Posada brings nearly 15 years of experience to the role. He joins the company from Howden Insurance Brokers, where he served as the LatAm treaty head for over three years. Prior to his tenure at Howden, Posada held various positions at JLT, starting as a commercial assistant and eventually rising to the role of senior vice president for Colombia and Peru as their head of strategy and senior broker based in Miami. He has also served as a board member of Howden Re Colombia and ACTER, the Colombian Reinsurance Association.
