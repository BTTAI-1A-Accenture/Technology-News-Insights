   Login Register   RainFocus™, a next-generation event marketing platform, has released new data integration solutions in collaboration with Adobe to seamlessly connect real-time behavioral event data with Adobe's technologies for accelerated growth.  RainFocus recently became an Adobe Certified Platinum Partner and has been working with Adobe to elevate customer journeys for joint clients and optimize omnichannel marketing and sales programs.

The new capabilities easily ingest and map RainFocus data into the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), enabling customers to manage and configure their instrumentation of RainFocus' digital workflow touchpoints for analytics. The data collected and aggregated from these solutions can be used to visualize attendee journeys and power more personalized experiences at scale.

"We have been working with Adobe on their event portfolio for the past five years, and this elevated partnership enables us to outline the customer journey so that we can deliver personalized experiences to our clients' customers, making each customer touchpoint more enticing and memorable," said JR Sherman, CEO of RainFocus. "Utilizing Adobe's innovative solutions and the RainFocus platform, we can deliver personalization at scale, measure impact and drive sales and ROI simultaneously for Adobe Summit and beyond."

The partnership gives companies the tools to leverage zero- and first-party customer data from events to fuel engagement with unique experiences. By bringing together event and marketing data, Adobe and RainFocus enable brands to connect with audiences through experiences and further engage audiences through digital marketing programs in meaningful ways.

"RainFocus, enhanced by Adobe integrations, helps enterprises personalize experiences for an underserved component of the marketing mix: events and conferences," said Justin Merickel, vice president of business development, Experience Cloud at Adobe. "Adobe Marketo Engage, Adobe Analytics and the RainFocus event platform together provide our mutual customers with great in-person, hybrid and virtual event experiences."

RainFocus and Adobe collaboratively delivered personalized experiences for attendees at Adobe Summit, which took place March 21-23 in Las Vegas and virtually. The hybrid event was powered by the RainFocus platform, enabling seamless experiences for more than 10,000 in-person and virtual attendees, 200 sessions and more than 170 sponsors.

During Adobe Summit, Brian Gates, senior vice president of industry strategy at RainFocus, and Marius Milcher, group product manager, strategic integrations at RainFocus presented "The Event Data You Need to Win More Customers.” Session attendees learned best practices on how to uncover event data through industry expert recommendations and received guidance on using analytics and intelligence to deliver personalized content for an exceptional experience.
