San Francisco 49ers linebacker Drake Jackson and the other rookies on the team learned just what it costs to make it in the league, even as the team claimed the NFC West title last week. Jackson posted the video on Instagram of what appeared to be the bill for the dinner, totaling just over $322,391. The eye-popping number had everyone on social media aghast, and they could not believe that could have been the final tally for the bill.

The dinner was 7500 me and 2 other vets gave 1k towards it. The rooks split 4500. We had a great time too. I had good vets as a young player I would never do a rookie like that," Armstead tweeted. The 49ers did have much reason to celebrate.
