These include discounts such as the military on-base discount that gives you up to 15% when you have your car in your garage on base.

Travelers has been offering insurance for over 165 years through its independent agents. Since its agents are independent, which means they represent multiple insurance companies, they’re there to help you choose a policy that’s truly right for you rather than just selling you products to get a commission. 
 
In addition to high ratings for customer service, Travelers offers savings through discounts such as multi-policy, safe driver, electric car, new car, good student, and more. You can also enroll in Travelers’ IntelliDrive program, which monitors your driving through a smartphone app and earns you a discount if you’ve been a safe driver.

Young drivers and others looking for discounts should pay special attention to State Farm. It offers numerous programs that can help you save money, many of which are concentrated on newer drivers. 
 
The Steer Clear program allows drivers who are under 25 and who have no at-fault accidents within the last three years to save up to 20% on their monthly premiums. Additionally, teen drivers can save up to 25% if they maintain good grades in school. 
 
Drivers looking to bundle their home and auto insurance could also save with State Farm. On average, customers save $1,073 each year on home and auto when they decide to bundle with State Farm, according to its website.

Amica strives to offer quality service. It has a 24/7 claims service where you can talk to an in-house representative who knows the ins and outs of Amica’s offerings. Plus, Amica’s online and mobile apps allow you to report and track your claims and manage your bill. 
 
As far as coverage goes, Amica provides a clear explanation of all of its options with helpful badges saying whether it’s necessary coverage or whether it’s just an added perk. If you see a plan that works for you, you can get a quote online or by calling an agent.
 
Progressive helps potential customers explore policies with other companies so you can compare options. And if you have a price in mind you’re looking to pay, Progressive’s Name Your Price tool allows you to tell Progressive how much you want to pay, and it will customize a policy that may work for you. 
 
Progressive also rewards safe drivers, as seen from its Snapshot option. Snapshot is a usage-based plan that may lower your rate if you’re a good driver. If you don’t drive often and you have a squeaky clean record, you could save an average of $231 a year just by using Snapshot, according to Progressive.

Nationwide has plans for many types of drivers, but its low-mileage driving programs are especially impressive. SmartRide, a usage-based program, could save you up to 40% if you’re a safe driver. You can get a 10% rate decrease just for signing up. SmartMiles® is Nationwide’s pay-per-mile option. You’ll pay a low base rate and then a per-mile rate on top of that. If you only drive every so often, you could end up paying less than you would for a traditional policy. 
 
Nationwide also offers a competitive range of discounts. There are discounts for bundling policies, going paperless, being a good student, making automatic payments, and more.

Another agent-centric insurance agency, Allstate has thousands of agents you can find, even in rural communities. These agents are there to help you file a claim, answer any questions, and secure discounts. They could also be a good resource for choosing the right coverage for a new driver in your household. 
 
Allstate offers many policy options, including the ability to purchase roadside assistance as a standalone policy or add the coverage to an existing policy. New drivers will appreciate the discount options available, including teenSMART, a program that educates teens on safe and defensive driving in exchange for a discount.

While only available in 12 states in the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, Erie offers those who qualify some unique perks. Its base policy, in some states, comes with more than just basic state minimum coverage. You could get protection for your pet in the event that you’re in an accident when they’re in the car. You may also get personal item coverage for your belongings inside your car, auto glass repair coverage, locksmith services, and roadside assistance.  
 
Erie has 13,000 agents for their small coverage area, making them a good option for drivers looking for a more personal touch to their insurance. On top of this perk, Erie offers a unique feature called ERIE Rate Lock. With Rate Lock, your rates will only increase if you add additional drivers to your policy or change the address where your car resides.

Auto-Owners is another agent-based insurer that focuses on building relationships between independent insurance agents and customers. Since agents are local, you can meet with someone in-person when you need to. 
 
Auto-Owners is currently only available in 26 states, but it provides superior service to its customers in those states and has a strong financial history, as demonstrated by its AM Best rating. It also includes additional perks with its policies such as accident forgiveness and rental car insurance.

To get the cheapest car insurance with the coverage you need, you should compare auto insurance companies and rates. There are different ways to go about this, and each strategy may offer varying results. What used to work in the past may not be the most efficient method anymore.
 
Here are a few ways you can compare auto insurers and their rates:
 
Pulling up an individual insurance provider’s website is typically easy to do on your phone, computer, or other device. You can browse through the coverage options it provides, get online quotes, and get a feel for the cost of car insurance. Once you’ve finished looking at one provider’s website, you can move on to the next and do more research with them. 
Insurance agents can be a useful resource for car insurance information since they’re the professionals on the subject, right? It’s true, they should know what they’re talking about, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to have an unbiased interaction with an agent. 
 
For example, an insurance agent who works with a specific company will most likely push you to get a car insurance policy with that company. It’s in their best interest to do so because that’s who they work for. This won’t help you if you’re trying to compare all the available options.
 
If you meet with an independent insurance agent, you’ll at least get a look at rates from multiple insurance companies. However, the agent will still be motivated to sell you something from their partners because that’s how they make money. So while the specific company may not matter as much to an independent agent, they may still pressure you to buy from them, even if you may not feel ready to do so. 
Another option is to use an auto insurance comparison tool, such as The Zebra or QuoteWizard. These “aggregator” sites gather data from an assortment of companies based on the information you provide. You can then look at the different offers and compare them. Regardless of how you get quotes, when you start getting quotes, make sure to shop around. Make sure you have the personal and vehicle information you’ll need on hand. Most insurance sites will ask you for some specifics like your zip code, name, address, driver's license number, and the car's make, model, vehicle identification number (VIN), and year of the vehicle you need insurance on.
 
When comparing car insurance prices, it’s essential you compare the exact same car insurance coverage limits between different providers. For example, you’ll want to make sure the collision coverage is for the same amount and has the same deductible. This is important because one company may look like it’s offering cheap car insurance, but if it doesn't provide the same amount of coverage, it’s not a fair comparison. 
 To fully understand the quote you’re offered, it’s also important to know how car insurance works and the different coverage types. Here are the key things to consider when you’re looking at an auto insurance policy:
 
Depending on your personal preferences, you may also want to investigate any perks or benefits that come with an insurance policy from a particular company. For example, some companies have great mobile apps, while others do not.
 
Finally, as part of your research, be sure to look at consumer insurance reviews and customer satisfaction ratings of any provider you’re considering. You may find that high customer satisfaction is an important factor for you. Consider looking at an insurer's J.D. Power and A.M. Best ratings, which measure customer satisfaction and financial strength. You can also find information on a large number of providers on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners website.
 
Different car insurance companies may offer very different premium pricing, but it’s also important to take into consideration how big of an impact your insurance profile and driving habits have on your auto insurance rates. If you feel like all the car insurance quotes you’re getting are high, then you may want to start working on the things you can change to get more affordable car insurance next time around.
 
Here are some of the major factors that affect car insurance rates:
 
  
Where you live can make a huge impact on how much you pay for auto insurance. States have different requirements, plus insurance companies factor where you live into their rates. For example, if you live in an area prone to floods or wildfires, your rates might be higher. Insurers also look at how many drivers are in your area. Generally, the more driver density, the more you could pay.  
 
Another variable that impacts your insurance is the number of miles you drive annually. If you drive infrequently, you could be eligible for lower rates. Below you can compare how much drivers in each state pay for car insurance per mile driven. We collected data on the average insurance premiums and average miles driven to calculate insurance cost per mile.4
 Drivers in New York and Michigan pay the most in car insurance premiums per mile – A driver can expect to pay $0.31 per mile on average. Drivers in Rhode Island fall in a distant third place, paying $0.22 per mile on average.  When looking at drivers who pay the least, Wyoming, North Dakota, Indiana, Idaho, Maine, and Mississippi come out on top. In Wyoming, drivers pay just $0.06 in insurance premiums per mile driven on average, while drivers in the other five states pay $0.07 per mile. 
 





  


What types of car insurance are you required to purchase? 

The types of car insurance you're required to purchase can vary from state to state, though most states require minimum coverage levels, typically for liability coverage. For instance, California typically requires that motorists purchase property damage and bodily injury liability coverage. Some states have additional requirements. For example, Florida requires that drivers purchase personal injury protection in addition to property damage liability coverage. If you are shopping around for insurance coverage, it's a good idea to research your state's requirements before you compare quotes.  



What is full coverage car insurance?

Typically, full coverage car insurance includes three different types of coverage: Liability insurance: If you're at fault in an accident, liability insurance may cover the cost of property damage and medical bills, depending on the type of coverage you have.Collision insurance: May cover car repair or replacement costs if you're in an accident.Comprehensive insurance: May cover repairs for events that are beyond your control, like theft and vandalism.



Which car insurers offer accident forgiveness?

Several car insurers offer accident forgiveness coverage, though it may not be available in every U.S. state and it typically only covers drivers for their first at-fault accident. For instance, Geico offers its customers the opportunity to earn or purchase this type of coverage in states where it's offered. It may protect drivers from increased rates as a result of their first at-fault accident.

From submitting claims to securing coverage, auto insurance can be complicated. That’s why we asked a team of experts to weigh in on common questions shoppers have when comparing auto insurance companies. 
 
When you decide to get involved in claims adjusting, there are several risks. One risk is that the person may demand a lot more than they’ve actually lost. If you start negotiating claims yourself, you may find that the other party wants a lot more than you think the loss is worth. 
 
Another risk is that you could really end up making the situation worse. Let’s say you decide to try to settle a loss yourself. If the injured party decides they want more money than you are willing to spend, you may turn it over to your insurance company anyway. It could possibly make things worse because you have effectively admitted blame. 
 
Nonetheless, auto policies usually contain a condition that requires you to notify the insurer of a claim or loss either way. I have never heard of an insurer denying a claim because the insured first decided to try and settle it themselves, but I guarantee you the claims adjuster who comes in to clean up the mess is not going to be happy and may note that in your file which may be reviewed upon renewal. 
 
Finally, keep in mind that even if you settle with the injured party amicably, the statute of limitations to file a lawsuit in most states is about two years. You might pay for their dented bumper today and think they’re satisfied, but in a few days, weeks, or months, they might contact a lawyer anyway and start suing you for the big bucks. The fact that you’ve already paid them something is pretty much an admission of blame on your part. 
 
The skilled claims adjusters at your insurer know the law and how best to resolve claims situations. Let them do their jobs, and never try to settle a bodily injury claim by yourself! It’s one thing to pay for a $500 mailbox, it’s another thing to start paying someone’s medical bills.

 Unless the estimate of property damage is above your deductible, there is no reason to report a minor motor vehicle accident to your insurer. You are better off just having it fixed on your own. 
The decision to file a claim has everything to do with the deductible amount for the damage. The easiest thing to do is to subtract the deductible amount from the cost of repair. If you get a $800 damage estimate and the deductible is $500, then the result is a positive $300 for which you should consider filing the claim. But if your deductible is $1000, then the resulting calculation would be a negative $200 for which you should clearly not file a claim since there is no net benefit. 
 
Keep in mind, however, that even if there is a positive net benefit, you may choose not to file a claim if you feel it will raise your overall insurance payment. This is especially true when the positive net benefit is rather small.
 
Even a minor accident can cost many thousands of dollars to repair given the large number of sensors, cameras, and other electronics packed into vehicles these days. My recommendation is to take the largest deductible you can afford — this will save you money. If you happen to be involved in a minor accident, you can apply those savings toward repairs you pay for out of your own pocket. 
 
More generally, for claims that are just a few hundred dollars to a thousand dollars or so over your deductible, a good case could be made for paying for these claims out of pocket. Filing the claim will increase your auto insurance premium — typically for three years — and result in higher quotes if you decide to change carriers over the next several years.
 
Very often, customers are unsure how to address claims in case of an accident. First, it is important to assess the extent of the damage you are facing. Sometimes, experienced car drivers are able to gauge this effectively. It is also important to thoroughly know your insurance policy and coverage, such as whether you have uninsured motorist coverage (which has two components, one that covers medical costs and the other that pays for your car repairs). Also, check for your deductible — typically, if you have a lower deductible, you are paying a higher premium, which means that in case of an accident where the estimated damages are $2000, and your deductible is $500, you are only required to pay the deductible amount while the insurance provider will pay the remainder.
 
Of course, in cases where the other driver is determined to be at fault, or in cases where you have zero-deductible/liability insurance, you do not need to pay any out-of-pocket costs. Each individual’s case is unique depending on the insurance coverage and deductible you signed up for. In case of any doubt or if you are unsure, I highly recommend talking to your insurance provider for better guidance and advice. If you find you are not getting the right answers from your insurance provider in cases of uninsured motorist or hit and run cases, I strongly advise contacting an experienced attorney specializing in such cases, who can better guide you.
 
The factors to be considered include (1) the repair cost, both labor and materials, (2) policy deductible, (3) potential increase of premium, and (4) adverse impact on car resale value. The first two factors are straightforward and easily estimated. The third and fourth factor are less obvious and may have long-term effects.
 
This is an economic decision based on the amount of the policy deductible. There is no “hard and fast” rule as to when minor damage should be submitted as a claim — much depends upon the ability of the policyholder to self-fund the repairs needed to the damaged auto. If, for example, the collision deductible is $1,000 per accident, a possible “minimum” amount of damage before a claim was to be submitted might be $2,000, although, again, it’s all dependent upon the insured’s ability to pay for damages out-of-pocket. 
 
Important to note, however, that if asked in a new or renewal policy application about prior accidents, even a self-funded repair of a prior accident needs to be disclosed to the insurer, as if any important information were misrepresented or concealed, there could be future adverse consequences if a claim were to be subsequently submitted arising from a separate accident or occurrence.
 
Most insurance contracts require you to inform your insurance provider of any accidents with your vehicle, even if you do not plan to file a claim. Having a discussion with your insurance company regarding the costs and benefits of making a claim is your best first step. They can give you the pros and cons of filing a claim given your specific coverage and the size of your deductible.
 
Important to note, however, that if asked in a new or renewal policy application about prior accidents, even a self-funded repair of a prior accident needs to be disclosed to the insurer, as if any important information were misrepresented or concealed, there could be future adverse consequences if a claim were to be subsequently submitted arising from a separate accident or occurrence.
 
When deciding whether to file a claim or fix the damage yourself, there are a few things to consider. First, compare the cost of repairs to your deductible. If your deductible is $500 and the repair cost is $600, it might be cheaper in the long run to pay for the repairs yourself. Filing a claim can make your premiums go up by about 20% for three years, so think about the long-term costs.
 
For example, if your annual premium is $1,200, a 20% increase means you’ll pay an extra $240 per year, or $720 over three years. If you have a history of making claims, insurance companies might see you as a high-risk driver and raise your premiums or even cancel your policy. For instance, having three claims in five years could increase your rates by 30%. Make sure to review your policy terms to see if there are any conditions that could affect your coverage after making a claim. If the damage is serious, like costing $2,000 to fix, or there might be hidden problems, it’s usually better to file a claim to make sure everything gets fixed properly. Additionally, if the accident involves another driver and their repair costs are high, filing a claim can help cover their expenses and protect you from legal issues. 
 
This completely depends on the cost of the accident versus your (current and future) deductibles. If the cost of the damage is minor (e.g., lower compared to current and future deductibles), you can have it fixed yourself; otherwise, you can make a claim to your insurance company.
 
If you can afford to fix it out of pocket, do so. In many states, coverage is not as available as it once was. Prices have gone up. Filing a claim may mean losing coverage or paying much higher prices in the future. Pay for small claims, but file for large ones. That's why you buy insurance — to cover costs that you cannot cover. Look around you. You will see many cars with dings and minor damage. A large number of people skip filing claims unless the car becomes too unsightly or undrivable. 
 
However, if anyone is injured, file a claim. There is likely to be a police report, so your insurance company will probably find out about it anyway. If you ding your bumper on the edge of the garage, the insurance folks may never know.
 
Insurance companies know that if you file a claim, you are more likely to file a future claim. If the quote for minor repairs is affordable to you out of pocket, it can probably be cheaper to pay for it yourself. This is especially true if the cost is below your deductible, as you'll be on the hook for the expense regardless, but now you've told your insurance company you've had an incident. Now perhaps if you are in another crash that year, you'll be closer to meeting your deductible, but hopefully, you are not in a second crash in a year. In cases where the repair is less than your deductible, it is usually best to pay out of pocket.
 
When you do have a potential claim for damage on an automobile, the first thing you want to do is look at your deductible. The deductibles are usually $1,000 or $500 dollars. If you have damage of, let's say, $2,000 to your car, a claim would still leave you owing $1,000 while the insurance companies cover the other $1,000. 
 
What you will get for that are two negative consequences. First, it is a claim on your policy — even though it is not a high dollar amount — it still counts as a claim. Insurance companies can cancel you for too many claims. A second effect is that the auto company may raise your insurance rates on your next renewal so you would end up paying for the repair through higher rates because you are now a greater risk. 
 
When deciding to make a claim against your policy remember that insurance is mainly protection for catastrophic losses — not every dollar. As such, I generally recommend claims only for major loss expenses.
   
Insurance companies use a credit-based insurance score to set prices. This score essentially uses some of the same points as the traditional credit information. The information points may differ from company to company based on their respective risk tolerances. Low credit scores may not prevent you from securing coverage, but the increased cost associated with a low credit score may. 
Some sort of auto insurance coverage will generally be available, and states require some coverage in order to license a vehicle. These rules vary by state, and you should check your state insurance department’s website for required insurance limits. However, just because you can get the coverage somewhere, it does not mean that every company will cover you, or that you can afford the coverage. Shop around if denied and consider a more expensive high-risk provider if necessary. You should not drive a vehicle without insurance, as you could be arrested if pulled over without the required coverage. 
Although it is possible a poor credit score could prevent someone from getting coverage from some insurance companies, it is more likely that a poor credit score will simply result in a higher premium. Remember that insurance premiums are all about the transfer of risk. The higher the perceived risk of an insurance company making a payout, the higher the premium that person will pay. Since lower credit scores statistically point to a higher likelihood of a payout, that means companies will either deny coverage or charge a higher rate to mitigate that risk. 
In many states, an insurance company can refuse coverage based on a poor credit history, as the insurance industry uses a different credit-based insurance score instead of the more common credit score. A few states prohibit using credit history to deny coverage or set rates, and in others, it is limited. Also, insurance companies may not come out and deny coverage for a bad credit history. Instead, they set an unreasonably high, unaffordable premium. You would still be able to find coverage in the Assigned Risk Pool, but this coverage is priced much higher than a traditional policy. So shop around on your own before accepting a policy from the Assigned Risk Pool.  Editor’s Note: The quotes above reflect the expert’s opinion and should only be considered with your own situation. Not all advice will fit with your circumstances, but these are included to give a wider picture for our readers. Some quotes have been edited by our editorial team for brevity and grammar.  
While nobody looks forward to filing an auto claim or having to go through the claims process, purchasing at least the minimum coverage required in your state can turn out to be a valuable investment. But since there are so many car insurance companies out there, do your best to research different rates and compare quotes between providers to find the insurance that best suits what you need.
 
For the quickest and most efficient way of finding the best rates, use a car insurance comparison site. This will take the hassle out of searching through different insurance products and spending a lot of time to find your answers.
