It’s baseball season again. That means spending gorgeous summer afternoons in grass-covered sporting cathedrals, enjoying hot dogs and peanuts, watching your favorite athletes perform at their peak condition, wasting 45 minutes finding your car in the parking lot and, most likely, lamenting your team being out of the race by the All-Star break. And yet, how matter how  your boys fare this season, we can all agree that there’s no limit to what Hollywood can do with America’s national pastime. Baseball is filled with heroes and villains, triumphs and scandals, last-minute victories and agonizing defeats. And so are baseball films. So whether it’s a crass team of Little Leaguers, a magical bat forged by lightning, a baseball groupie and her ditzy boyfriend, or an Iowa cornfield that conjures up the sport’s glorious past, baseball is perfect subject for a film because it’s the perfect analogy for life itself. Here are 21 essential baseball movies that hit it out of the park.  Tommy Lee Jones went outside the box, and inside the ballpark, with , his  follow-up to an Oscar-winning turn in . In this uneven-but-well-acted baseball biopic, Jones plays Hall of Fame outfielder Ty Cobb—an early 20th century ballplayer who stood alongside greats like Babe Ruth, but who also distinguished himself for being a racist, wife-beating drunk who was loathed by fans and teammates equally. Written and directed by Bull Durham’s Ron Shelton and co-starring an exceptional Jessica Lange as Cobb’s wife, Cobb explores the dark side of one of America’s most divisive sports figures.
