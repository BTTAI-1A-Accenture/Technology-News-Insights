Syracuse, N.Y. — Jim Boeheim spoke at the postgame podium for nearly 13 minutes following Syracuse basketball’s 96-76 loss to Georgia Tech on Tuesday night. Boeheim was humble in defeat following his team’s fourth-straight loss by 17 or more points and third straight game it has given up more than 90 points. Hey @BrentAxeMedia no spoilers on how the game went please. Excited to catch it at 11 PM on YES Network! Go Orange!
