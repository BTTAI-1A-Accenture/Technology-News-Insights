Smartphones have become such a vital part of human life at this point that virtually no one can imagine leaving their home without one. They keep you connected to people around the world, making communication almost too easy, leaving some to even consider them a technological addiction. There are many critics of this development who believe that people today may even over-rely on smartphones, which in itself may lead to several problems. However, for the companies involved in this market, this reliance on their products can only mean good things. The beneficiaries of smartphone addiction include companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF), to name only a few. As each year passes, the number of people subscribed to a mobile service rises. According to a report on the mobile industry published by the GSM Arena, by the end of 2022, more than 5.4 billion people across the globe had subscribed to a mobile service. 4.4 billion people were also using mobile internet. These numbers have made it possible for the mobile technologies and services market to generate 5% of the global GDP in 2022, which amounted to about $5.2 trillion of economic value. It also helped support 28 million jobs across the global mobile ecosystem. According to the report, this will not be the end of mobile services and technology’s dominance. GSM Arena forecasts that 5G adoption will reach 17% in 2023, rising to about 54% by 2030. This percentage would be equivalent to 5.3 billion connections across the globe and would add another $1 trillion to the global economy in 2030. As far as smartphone connections are concerned, the report forecasts that by 2030, we can expect these connections to rise to 9 billion, which would be equivalent to about 92% of total mobile connections. Additionally, it was mentioned that global smartphone data traffic will also rise more than threefold by 2028, helped primarily by users in North America and Northeast Asia, where the majority of users reside. These statistics highlight not only the immense growth of the mobile industry but also its ability to continue contributing to the global economy. GSM Arena expects the industry to continue growing its revenue in both developed and developing regions through 2030. The mobile ecosystem has also been contributing to the public sector. In 2022, for example, the ecosystem contributed about $530 billion to the sector through taxes. Primary drivers include services VAT, sales taxes, and excise duties which brought in about $210 billion of the total amount. They were followed by employment taxes and social security, which generated about $160 billion. All of the above goes to show that this industry is one that has proven itself as a vital driver of the global economy, and the same holds true for individual countries’ economies as well. The technology sector at large is one that has been doing immensely well in 2023, primarily in light of the artificial intelligence boom caused by discussions surrounding generative AI. Due to this, many major smartphone companies are also being swept up in the tide, with endless opportunities now opening up for them.
