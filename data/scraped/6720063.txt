A video of travel company Ixigo launching an AI-powered earbud named 'bhAI' which aims to provide real-time assistance to travelers is going viral on the internet.  An archive of the post can be seen here. (Source: Twitter/Screenshot) (More archives to similar claims can be found here, here, and here.) But...: The product was fictional, and the commercial was a prank video. The company took to their social media handles to clarify that the viral video was part of its April Fool's campaign. How did we find out?: A keyword search led us to the original video uploaded on Ixigo's Facebook page.  The video was uploaded on 30 March. The post's caption said, "Introducing ixigo bhAI: Now travel with the power of AI in your ear! Book now: ixigobhAI.com." On clicking the link, we were redirected to a post uploaded on the company's Twitter handle which carried a GIF of Happy April Fools' week.  It was uploaded on 3 April and its caption read, "Please forgive us brother. But we're thrilled that you loved ixigo bhAI & joined in on all the fun. A special discount code is on the way for everyone who signed up! #happyaprilfoolsweek."
