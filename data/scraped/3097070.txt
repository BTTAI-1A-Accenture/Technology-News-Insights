It's Christmas every day in Ironbridge where a newly-relocated shop has opened "the first festive-themed cafe in the land". The Little Christmas Shop of Ironbridge originally opened three years ago at Tontine Hill with help from a Â£10,000 Pride in the High Street Fund from Telford & Wrekin Council. But business has boomed so much they needed a new base and the owner saw a gap in the market. Business owner Kim Warren said: "We opened three years ago this month and people said we wouldn't last five minutes. "But they love us. There is a trend to get a Christmas present from wherever you go, so we have the tourists who come to Ironbridge and locals who visit regularly, too.
