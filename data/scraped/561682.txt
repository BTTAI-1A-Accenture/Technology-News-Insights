100m USD ARR Milestone and Phenomenal Growth Reinforces Armis' Position as The Leader in Asset Cybersecurity as it Prepares for Future IPO SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Armis, the leading asset visibility and security provider, announced today that it has surpassed the 100m USD mark in annual recurring revenue (ARR) growing from 1m USD to 100m USD in less than 5 years. This makes the company one of the fastest-growing centaurs in the SaaS and cloud technology space and the fastest-growing cyber start-up for asset visibility, intelligence and security. "Making centaur status so quickly is testament to the business use cases we solve and why customers around the world have chosen us over anyone else," said Yevgeny Dibrov, CEO and Co-founder of Armis. "Armis offers a comprehensive platform to enable customers to address all their asset visibility, vulnerability, intelligence and security needs in one place. As we look towards future opportunities, including a potential IPO, we continue to ensure we are growing efficiently, maximizing our business and partner model and remain on track to cash flow profitability." Armis' explosive growth has been driven by its award-winning asset visibility and security platform which has been adopted by the world's leading organizations and Fortune 100 companies, such as Colgate-Palmolive, Mondelez International, DocuSign, Allegro Microsystems and Takeda Pharmaceuticals in addition to many national, state, regional and federal entities across North America, EMEA and APJ. For Takeda Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest risks is a disruption in supply chain continuity, which would slow or prevent the delivery of medicine to patients. "The most likely cause for not getting product to patients is a potential incident where a cyberattack takes a plant down and renders the computer-driven devices unusable," said Mike Towers, Chief Digital Trust Officer, Takeda Pharmaceuticals. "We primarily deployed Armis for this use caseâto improve our supply continuity and the resiliency of our overall manufacturing process. At Takeda, nothing comes before making sure that we get our medicines to patients, and Armis is one of the key contributors to making sure that we can do that." Listen to Mike Towers, Chief Digital Trust Officer, Takeda Pharmaceuticals  discussing why they chose Armis.

Armis is backed by world-class investors including Insight Venture Partners, CapitalG, Brookfield, One Equity Partners and Georgian.
