 You will now be able to edit your WhatsApp chats for up to 15 minutes after sending them, Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday. The feature has been available for WhatsApp beta users on Android and the web for a few days and is now rolling out to all users around the world. This is a gradual rollout so if you don’t see the feature yet, you will in the coming weeks. The chat edit feature is currently rolling out on WhatsApp for Android with version number 2.23.11.15. Make sure to update the app from the Play Store. As for iPhones, the update is yet to roll out. Here are the steps to edit sent messages. Edited messages will display ‘edited’ alongside them so that the receiver is aware that the message was corrected or changed. However, the receiver will not be able to see the edit history. The WhatsApp chat edit feature would be welcomed by all users given how easy it is to make typos or send the wrong message when typing in a hurry. Previously, users had the option to delete WhatsApp messages, but the ability to edit messages is simply more convenient.
