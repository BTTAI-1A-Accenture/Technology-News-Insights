 You can check out the list of 2024 Top Companies here. LinkedIn Top Companies is a ranking of the 50 best workplaces to grow a career. Backed by unique LinkedIn data measuring different elements of career progression, the list reveals companies like Medtronic, Nike and Backbase, that are helping their employees build careers that will set them up for long-term success. This year continues to bring waves of disruption in the labor market — from advancements in AI to the rise of the ‘quiet’ trend (‘quiet quitting’, ‘quiet hiring’, ‘quiet firing’). Despite strong hiring numbers, economic uncertainty and news of layoffs persist — prompting many professionals to seek their best next career move and employers to rethink how they attract, retain and develop talent.  Our 3rd annual LinkedIn Top Companies list is the resource to find the 25 best Dutch workplaces to grow your career right now. The methodology looks at components like how employees are advancing both within a company and when they leave, how they’re upskilling while employed there, and more — revealing companies that help set people up to get ahead in their careers.  Our 3rd annual LinkedIn Top Companies list is the resource to find the 25 best Dutch workplaces to grow your career right now. The methodology looks at components like how employees are advancing both within a company and when they leave, how they’re upskilling while employed there, and more — revealing companies that help set people up to get ahead in their careers.  When compiling the list, we also consider factors like attrition and layoffs. Companies that have laid off 10% or more of their workforce between Jan. 1, 2022 and the list launch, based on public announcements — or that have attrition greater than 10%, based on LinkedIn data — are ineligible to rank. Wondering how to use the rankings in your own career or job search? This list is filled with actionable insights and resources for professionals at every level. For each company, you’ll find data around in-demand skills, top locations and more (tip: clicking on a skill will bring you directly to a relevant LinkedIn Learning course). If a company sparks your interest, take a look at their current job openings and connect with employees you may know, or turn on job alerts to stay on top of future opportunities.  ASML is the parent company of Hermes Microvision, Cymer and others.

You can read more about how we compile the list below — and you can also check out the Top Companies in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, New Zealand, Philippines, Portugal, Poland, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, the UAE, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our methodology uses LinkedIn data to rank companies based on eight pillars that have been shown to lead to career progression: ability to advance; skills growth; company stability; external opportunity; company affinity; gender diversity; educational background and employee presence in the country. Ability to advance tracks employee promotions within a company and when they move to a new company, based on standardized job titles. Skills growth looks at how employees across the company are gaining skills while employed at the company, using standardized LinkedIn skills. Company stability tracks attrition over the past year, as well as the percentage of employees that stay at the company at least three years. External opportunity looks at Recruiter outreach across employees at the company, signaling demand for workers coming from these companies. Company affinity, which seeks to measure how supportive a company’s culture is, looks at connection volume on LinkedIn among employees, controlled for company size. Gender diversity measures gender parity within a company and its subsidiaries. Finally, educational background examines the variety of educational attainment among employees, from no degree up to Ph.D. levels, reflecting a commitment to recruiting a wide range of professionals. Finally, employee presence in the country looks at the company’s number of employees in the country relative to other companies, as a means of capturing companies that provide a diverse work environment and more opportunities for career advancement and networking.  To be eligible, companies must have had at least 500 employees as of Dec. 31, 2022 in the country and attrition can be no higher than 10% over the methodology time period, based on LinkedIn data. Similarly, companies with layoffs that amount to more than 10% of their workforce, based on public announcements between Jan. 1, 2022 and the list launch, are also ineligible. Only parent companies rank on the list; majority-owned subsidiaries and data about those subsidiaries are incorporated into the parent company score. The methodology time frame is Jan. 1, 2022 through Dec. 31, 2022. This analysis represents the world seen through the lens of LinkedIn data, drawn from the anonymized and aggregated profile information of LinkedIn's members around the world. We exclude all staffing and recruiting firms, educational institutions and government agencies. We also exclude LinkedIn, its parent company Microsoft and Microsoft subsidiaries. *Company insights were sourced from LinkedIn Talent Insights and include the parent company and majority-owned subsidiaries. Data reflects aggregated public member data from active LinkedIn profiles in the relevant country and includes employee profiles associated with the parent company and majority-owned subsidiaries on LinkedIn. We exclude members who identify as interns or contractors. All insights reflect a 12-month time period looking back from January 2023. Top locations were categorized as the regions or cities that employed the largest percentage of each company. Skills data was derived from measuring the most frequent unique skills among a company’s employees, relative to other companies. Most common job titles represent the occupations that are most common within each company. Largest job function measures the function area most prevalent within each company.  Reported and proofread by: Liza Jansen Methodology and insights by: LinkedIn Economic Graph-team Managing editors: Solange Uwimana, Lynn Chouman Special Projects Leads: Marie Malzac (EMEA), Michele Pierri (Internationaal) Regional Lead: Julien Wettstein International Executive Editor: Sandrine Chauvin Honoree companies: 1.
