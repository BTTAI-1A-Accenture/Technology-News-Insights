Local news: WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT The sight of a dead koala at the base of a tree has sparked outcry amid claims the native animal was recently relocated to make way for development. The koala, known as Cathie Bravo, lived in the Lake Cathie area near Port Macquarie for 15 years before being removed last August, the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital wrote on Instagram. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today  Cathie Bravo’s death is under investigation but it’s understood it came “after a large part of his home range was cleared for development”, the post said. YouTube footage earlier in 2022 showed a construction fence metres from the much-loved marsupial. Cathie Bravo had been relocated to a reserve next to a local community centre — a more suburban environment than his natural home. The move sparked outrage in the community, with opponents to the relocation telling local media it was “heartbreaking and shameful”. The koala hospital said there had been “local extinctions” of koalas “across Port Macquarie”. “Now more than ever, every tree is important to our local koalas,” the hospital said. Local photographer Susan Monkley paid tribute to Cathie Bravo. “After delighting people in Lake Cathie for years, sadly Cathie Bravo was found dead at the base of a tree last week,” she said on Facebook. “He was a gorgeous koala, and I will never forget the excitement the first time I saw him (and each and every time).” 7NEWS.com.au has contacted Port Macquarie-Hastings Council for a response to claims about Cathie Bravo’s death. 2 min read 1 min read Stream free on 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 1 min read 0 min read 1 min read 2 min read 2 min read 2 min read 2 min read 3 min read 1 min read 0 min read 1 min read 2 min read 2 min read Stay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.
