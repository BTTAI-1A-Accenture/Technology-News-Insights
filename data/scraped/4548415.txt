A new report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has revealed more details about Apple's upcoming M4 Mac Mini, with the report stating Apple is about to make its biggest design change to its smallest computer offering. According to the report, Apple's upcoming M4 Mac Mini will arrive in at least three different models, each sporting at least three USB-C's on the back, an HDMI port, and a power cable. In terms of design, Gurman was told the M4 Mac Mini is "essentially an iPad Pro in a small box," and the box will measure around 1.4 inches in height, making it the smallest desktop computer Apple has ever offered. As for specifics about the M4 chip, reports indicate it will arrive with a powerful new CPU that has four performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. Additionally, the M4 is reportedly 50% faster than the M2. The new chip will also come with a 10-core GPU, Dynamic Caching, and hardware ray-tracing - all of which will be 4x faster than the M2 iPad Pro. As for the Neural Engine, reports indicate it will be a 16-core design that is capable of 38 trillion operations per second, which is 60x faster than Apple's first Neural Engine.

Check it out: The new Lenovo YOGA Portal Ultimate PC is aimed at the Chinese market, inside powered with an Intel Core i7-14700 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 graphics. The global market version of the Neo Ultra variant features up to an Intel Core i9-14900 processor and RTX 4060 graphics, so the Chinese version has a less powerful CPU, but much more powerful GPU. Lenovo isn't using the Laptop GPU variant of the GeForce RTX 4070, but the actual full desktop RTX 4070. Lenovo's new YOGA Portal Ultimate PC can have its CPU swapped out because the company is using Intel's desktop LGA1700 socket, but the GPU might be a harder upgrade given that the custom cooling inside of the system is designed for this form factor. Continue reading: Lenovo's new YOGA Portal Ultra Compact PC: up to Core i7-14700, up to RTX 4070 (full post) Alright, this new Telsa Cybertruck Mini-PC is the coolest thing I've seen today: inside, featuring the AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS "Hawk Point" APU and you even press the hood of the system to power it on. Taku Udon has now reviewed the new Cybertruck Mini-PC, and instead of looking like a regular -- but modded -- PC, it looks like a Tesla Cybertruck RC that is actually a PC. We're talking about having shock absorbers; all four doors can be opened, and you can even steer the wheels. Oh yeah, the trunk has an expanding ramp because you'll never use it, but it's there. So cool. Under the Cybertruck's rear bumper, you'll find all of the connectors hidden away, with the power button hidden under the front shock absorbers. This means you'll have to press the truck down to start the PC, which is so cool to hear. Continue reading: Tesla Cybertruck PC tested: press the hood to start the fastest Ryzen APU on wheels (full post) GEEKOM has just unveiled its new Mega Mini G1 PC: an interestingly designed Mini-PC that would look crazy good on any gaming desk. The new GEEKOM Mega Mini G1 is a futuristically-styled new Mini-PC that measures 250 x 150 x 150mm, already showcased at MWC and Computex earlier this year, it's now bigger and will be shown in prototype form at IFA in September. Inside, GEEKOM will pack up to an Intel Core i9-13900H processor (14 cores, 22 threads) with up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 discrete GPU. GEEKOM includes OCulink connectivity, so if you wanted faster GPU performance than what the RTX 4060 is capable of, you can hook up an external graphics card with far more power. GEEKOM says that the RTX 4060 GPU inside of its new Mega Mini G1 PC runs at up to 120W, showing some performance metrics to back up those claims: Continue reading: GEEKOM Mega Mini G1: water-cooled Mini-PC with Core i9-13900H, RTX 4060 for $1000 (full post) Global PC shipments rose by 3% for this year's second quarter, marking two consecutive quarters of growth after an alarming two years of decline. PC shipments hit 64.9 million units for the three months ending in June, which is great news for the industry as we head into the AI PC era. However, even though everyone's talking about and pushing AI, it sounds like regular PC sales are driving the growth, especially those from Apple. According to research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), Apple's shipments increased by 20.8% for the quarter, followed by Acer, whose shipments grew by 13.7%. Even though Apple saw significant growth, its market share of 8.8% sits below that of companies like Lenovo (22.7%), HP Inc. (21.2%), and Dell Technologies (15.5%). Looking at the top five companies, Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, and Acer, only Dell saw a 2.4% decline in shipments. With Microsoft's new Copilot+ PCs recently debuting and more AI-ready mobile hardware on the way from AMD and Intel later this year, it will be interesting to see what impact AI PCs have on global PC shipments.

This is an innovative device revealed by a Chinese manufacturer, Linglong, who showed off the keyboard PC in a presentation on Bilibili (as flagged up by Tom's Hardware). The computer-keyboard hybrid folds in half so it'll actually fit in a pocket (and that feat is actually demonstrated in the presentation for the device).
