 A spandrel glass façade hides structural elements, mechanical systems, or other building components behind the glass.  Blackline Aluminum is using various types of glass to make spandrel glass, such as tempered glass, and heat-strengthened glass. In order to achieve the desired color or opacity, the glass is usually painted or coated. As part of a window system or as a curtain wall, spandrel glass can be installed in different use.  The Blackline Aluminum spandrel glass is made by applying a ceramic frit or OPACI color coat. This coating is then baked onto the glass, creating a durable and long-lasting finish. The ceramic frit is available in a range of colors.  The Blackline Aluminum spandrel glass is often paired with clear or tinted glass to create a unique and modern look for the building's exterior. It is also highly energy-efficient, as it helps to reflect heat and reduce solar gain, which can lower the energy costs associated with cooling the building.
