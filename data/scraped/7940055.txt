 For young people about to leave the social care system in Cambridgeshire, it’s a time of major transition and uncertainty. It’s essential that they can access reliable digital technology, for the purposes of education, employment and to stay connected to vital support networks. Together, with local youth services and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we want to help these young people, but we need your support! Essential Raspberry Pi computer kits are urgently needed for young people leaving care across Cambridgeshire.  Each kit includes a high-quality computer, HD monitor, webcam and headset. A donation of £2,500 will provide 10 local young people with their own kit.  Please contact joe.edwards@raspberrypi.org.uk to find out about how you can help with this campaign or other ways to support Raspberry Pi's work. Thank you for your support.  The mission of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is to enable young people to realise their full potential through the power of computing and digital technologies. We believe every young person deserves this chance regardless of background or life circumstances.
