Louise Thomas Editor EDITORS/NEWS DIRECTORS: Transgender medical treatment for children and teens is increasingly under attack in many states and has lately been subject to restrictions or outright bans. But it has been available in the United States for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations. Research has shown that transgender youths and adults can be prone to suicidal behavior when forced to live as the sex they were assigned at birth. And critics of legislation to restrict gender-affirming care for children say it’s an attempt by conservatives to motivate their voting base. Opponents of youth transgender medical treatment often say say that children shouldn’t make life-altering decisions they might regret and that there’s no solid proof of purported benefits, citing widely discredited research. Here are some resources for reporting on the issue in your area. ___ FIND AP's STORIES HERE — EXPLAINER: What medical treatments do transgender youth get? — Trans kids’ treatment can start younger, new guidelines say — How common is transgender treatment regret, detransitioning? — Anxiety, fear fill West Virginia transgender-health clinic ___ WHERE IS IT HAPPENING? As of April 7 this year, at least 13 states had enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Utah, South Dakota and West Virginia. Federal judges have blocked enforcement of laws in Alabama and Arkansas. Bills in some other states have been introduced, are advancing, or have been passed but not yet enacted.  ___ FOCUS ON YOUR COMMUNITY — Is your state considering bills to limit gender-affirming care for minors, and what is their status?

If children meet guidelines and are showing early signs of puberty, they can begin fully reversible medication that pauses it. If the gender dysphoria persists, they can begin hormone treatments that prompt sexual development, but typically not until age 16 and with parental consent. Guidelines say surgery generally should be reserved for those ages 18 and older. Research has shown that regret is very rare and that transgender youths and adults are prone to stress, depression and suicidal behavior when forced to live as the sex they were assigned at birth. ___ MEDICAL RESOURCES — The American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and the Endocrine Society are respected medical authorities on gender-affirming care for youths.
