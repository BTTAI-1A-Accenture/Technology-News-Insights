  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition CHICO — Highway 99’s seven-mile double barrel through Chico is a topic of heated claims between licensed drivers about how to properly drive.Though drivers education may have taught about merging lanes, this sign in Chico appears to be uncommon — at least not mentioned in the most recent California Manual of Uniform Traffic Devices.“Thru traffic use left lane next 7 miles,” states a sign seen driving southbound into Chico. It’s counterpart on the northbound lanes says “next 6 miles.”According to Gilbert Mohtes-Chan, public information officer for Caltrans District 3 which has jurisdiction over the sign, said it’s simply a suggestion for drivers to avoid slowing down in the rightmost lane.“It’s a way to get motorists to get in the left lane, then it reduces the amount of traffic called traffic conflicts where someone on the right hand lane has to slow for someone merging,” Mohtes-Chan said.“It ends up causing that lane to slow down, and a lot of times at the last minute will move into the left hand lane — the fast lane — and that starts creating a domino effect.”A Facebook page, titled “Butte County Bad Drivers” hosted several discussion on the topic in, perhaps, an attempt to show to others how they’re driving wrong.One sentiment claims that large, heavy semitrailers are the ones who should be reading the sign — and merging left to let oncoming traffic into the freeway.

But that’s not necessarily the case, according to Mohtes-Chan; truckers may stay on the right side, and the sign is mostly a suggestion for people who wish to go faster, he said.“Most truckers have a speed limit; though trucks don’t always follow it. The trucks usually go slower,” he said. “There’s only two lanes in that area and it gets slow especially during times there will be more traffic.”A more commonly known sign, “Thru traffic merge left” is detailed in the official Caltrans manual as needed when a lane is being dropped at the next exit.Related Articles

Mohtes-Chan said he doesn’t know of any similar signs to Chico’s “merge left next 7 miles” off the top of his head in the district, but they may be common in some rural areas.He said Chico’s unique position as an urban city in a rural area, with its seven miles of freeway exits, is not a common case and may explain the rarity of the sign; and that such a sign wouldn’t be located in cities with three highway lanes, unlike Chico’s two.The area’s population has grown significantly in recent decades while the highway has remained two lanes.With human drivers, there’s still a chance to read and understand the sign.As for new technologies that promise to “autopilot” drivers to their destination, “They read the speed limits, but I don’t know how smart the software is to read every sign,” Mohtes-Chan said about his experience with autopilot vehicles.
