With complimentary Cloud Security Assessments, Capture the Flag tools, and enhanced post-sale service for more secure customer outcomes MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 28, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lacework ®, the data-driven cloud security company, today announced major enhancements to the Lacework Partner Program that will drive improved business outcomes for customers. The program helps partners focus on the specific security needs of customers, making it easier to help organizations find the best security solution for their environment with the Lacework Polygraph ® Data Platform. Customers receive faster time to protection and insights and ongoing support for their cloud security solution. For years, Lacework has been building and continuously expanding its partner program to address the neverending challenge of cloud security and reward its partners with industry leading discounts, incentives and enablement to facilitate the customer conversation. With increasing customer demand for cloud security solutions, partners are essential to meeting the needs of these cloud businesses and are involved in 85% of all new deals. Lacework is now expanding the program, which recently received a 5-star rating in the 2023 CRN Partner Program Guide, to include new features and capabilities, such as: "Lacework's value to the AWS customer is crystal clear and differentiated," said Chris Grusz, Director of Business Development, AWS Marketplace, Service Catalog, and Control Tower at AWS. "By co-selling, co-marketing, and co-building alongside us, we're helping provide customers with a more comprehensive understanding of the security market so they can make the right decision for their environments over the long term." Furthering its commitment to customers, Lacework created a new Managed Service Provider (MSP) Program within the Lacework Partner Program. Designed for MSPs, this new initiative is for partners who deliver security outcomes for their customers as part of a whole stack service offering. The Lacework MSP Program allows organizations without a full security team to bring Lacework to their environment, without having to worry about building their own team. "Emerging markets like cloud security are filled with a lot of noise from vendors and a lot of options for customers and partners to explore," said Bob Layton, Chief Channel Officer at eSentire. "We focus on helping all members of our ecosystem cut through that noise so they can understand what their environment truly needs and how to implement that effectively and efficiently. This new MSP Program from Lacework is just another signal to us and the broader market that they're laser focused on doing right by partners and customers." "Cloud security is already an uphill battle, and today's macroeconomic environment only poses further challenges as enterprises seek to protect their continuously changing environments with fewer resources," said Brian Lanigan, VP, Worldwide Channels & Alliances, Lacework. "That's why we strive to make securing the cloud as seamless as possible for organizations of all sizes. By working together with our global network of VARs, MSSPs, SIs, and CSPs, we can help customers achieve the best security outcome for their business while also benefiting the entire partner community."
