Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) argued the planned price tag is nearly four times the current $30 price paid by the U.S. government and also represents a 10,000% markup over what some researchers have calculated as the cost to produce the vaccine. advertisement They demanded Bourla provide more information about its pricing and “unseemly profiteering.” STAT+ Exclusive Story Already have an account?
