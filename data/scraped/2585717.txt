IShowSpeed once again sent the internet into a frenzy on August 16 after he accidentally flashed privates to nearly 25,000 viewers live on his YouTube stream.  He quickly ended the stream soon after the unfortunate incident happened, later deleting the broadcast.

The streamer went quiet afterward, where suspicions began to build that a YouTube ban may be imminent.

At the start of the YouTube stream, he addressed the situation head-on, mentioning that the incident was impacting his mental well-being and his family negatively. “This is truly an embarrassing f*cking moment for me. Nah, really. And I’ve lately been, in these past hours, I’ve been suffering mentally,” he said. Later in the stream, he headed to Roblox to play on a game server, which soon turned toxic as more fans joined the server and began to chase him around. Players could be seen following him around in a mob-like crowd speaking through their mics and hurling negative comments toward the streamer as they chanted “IShowMeat” in reference to the tragic mishap. 🚨| WATCH: Viewers stream snipe Speed on Roblox and chase him screaming "IShowMeat" pic.twitter.com/p6qmNjC6X8 Naturally, Speed began to lose his cool shouting: “Get the f*ck away from me!” as fans continued chasing him around the game, leading to him ultimately stopping playing. 🚨| BREAKING: Speed abruptly ends stream after urging a fan to stop talking about his p*nis because of how it affects him mentally pic.twitter.com/bDEgWwIO5e Finally, it all got too much for the streamer who later ended his stream after a fan wouldn’t stop talking about the situation on the popular live video chat platform Omegle.
