The Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS) is the research institute of the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Utrecht University. UIPS focuses on processes around discovery, development, and use of drugs and medical nutrition using molecular and technological principles from the Natural and Life Sciences. This research is ideally positioned in the Faculty of Science to work on basic scientific problems and to translate new findings into potential solutions to urgent societal medical needs, which are addressed in the Faculties of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine. Every year around 400 peer-reviewed articles are published and around 30 PhD candidates defend their thesis. UIPS is partner in several open source innovation networks. Dr. E.E.

The Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology group does research on several epidemiological, therapeutic, and policy aspects of chronic drug use. The research in the Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics group focuses on the use of mass spectrometry to understand the inner workings of cells. The Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery group focuses on design, chemo- or biosynthesis of compounds with biological or (potential) medicinal applications and interaction with their receptors. The core activity of the Pharmaceutics group is the design and pre-clinical testing of tailor-made drug delivery systems.
