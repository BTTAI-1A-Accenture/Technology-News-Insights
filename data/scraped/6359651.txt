The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. A Kentucky boy with cerebral palsy is getting a chance to live out every kid's dream job. Lane Hartzel is now an official chocolate taste tester for Hershey's. It started with a school career day project. Lane's parents didn't know what their son could pick since he's non-verbal and non-mobile. His teachers suggested a chocolate critic. Hershey quickly reached out after hearing about it on social media. "I think moving forward, it opens our eyes as educators ourselves, that every child, every adult, has something they can do. We just have to make the world a place they can do it in," said Tyler Hartzel, Lane's dad. Lane's story is now featured in a Hershey ad that was released on Monday.
