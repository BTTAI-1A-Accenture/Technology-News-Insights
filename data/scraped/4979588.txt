Selected from hundreds of applications, the ten early-stage companies will explore and test their business models and fast-track potential partnerships during six-week intensive program
 PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs announced the launch of its Enterprise AI Accelerator, where ten selected startups will spend the next six weeks working alongside leaders from Comcast to explore advancements in artificial intelligence for large-scale businesses.

  
Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs is focused on facilitating startup-enterprise partnerships through access and connection to Comcast’s network of business leaders and corporate partners. The accelerator welcomes startups at various stages in their entrepreneurial journeys, from pre-seed to growth stage, and does not involve issuance of equity in exchange for participation. This program is LIFT Labs’ second accelerator in 2023, following a Generative AI-themed program earlier this spring that resulted in all participants securing partnerships with Comcast organizations.

 
The Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs Enterprise AI Accelerator Cohort includes:
 
“We see tremendous value in partnering with startup founders through our LIFT Labs programming to learn more about the latest innovations and explore how they might be beneficial for our businesses in the future,” said Sam Schwartz, Chief Business Development Officer at Comcast. “Advancements in AI are helping enterprises become smarter, faster, and more agile, and we look forward to engaging with these impressive startups.”

 
In addition to receiving concierge-level support through Comcast’s network of business units and functional areas, participants will also engage in a bespoke curriculum featuring guidance in topics such as marketing, media relations, and enterprise sales. They join a network of more than 60 alumni from Comcast’s five years of startup programming. The program is run in partnership with VentureFuel – an organization that specializes in the commercialization of new technology through corporate-startup collaborations.

 
The Enterprise AI Accelerator will conclude with a startup showcase in November. Corporates, investors, and startup leaders interested in learning more about this year’s cohort and Comcast NBCUniversal LIFT Labs are encouraged to visit lift.comcast.com/accelerator and follow LIFT Labs channels across LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and X to learn more.
