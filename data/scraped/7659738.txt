Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - May 8, 2023) - NorthStar Gaming Holdings Inc. BET (the "Company" or "NorthStar") is pleased to announce it has closed its previously announced acquisition (the "Transaction") of Slapshot Media Inc., a Canadian iGaming marketing and managed services company that specializes in providing managed services to Spreads.ca, an iGaming site owned and operated by the Abenaki Council of Wolinak. The goal of this strategic Transaction is to ultimately open up the Canadian market to the NorthStar brand outside Ontario, and materially expand the addressable market available to NorthStar via its relationship with Spreads.ca.  This strategic acquisition is highly complementary to NorthStar's current online casino and sportsbook offerings. Spreads.ca is not and will not be made available in Ontario and NorthStar Bets will continue to be the only online casino and sports book offered by NorthStar in Ontario.
