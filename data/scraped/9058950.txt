OLIVETTE — A software company plans to leave New York City and relocate to Olivette in St. Louis County. Latch, which provides smart locks for residential buildings, plans to employ more than 30 people at its new headquarters at 1220 North Price Road, northwest of Olive Boulevard and Interstate 170, in Olivette. It currently has 16 workers in the St. Louis region, according to a release. The move coincides with a rebranding of the company, which will be known as Door.com next year. The company will expand its offerings to include software for service providers like cleaning services, dog walkers and others. "St. Louis is an ideal location as it is centrally located, offers an affordable cost of living, and has a diverse talent pool, especially in the tech and manufacturing sectors," CEO Jamie Siminoff said in a statement. "Simply said: We love St. Louis!" Siminoff founded smart doorbell company Ring. Amazon bought the company in 2018. Latch is currently hiring for positions in sales, finance, engineering and warehouse operations. Steph Kukuljan • 314-340-8506 skukuljan@post-dispatch.com Get local news delivered to your inbox!
