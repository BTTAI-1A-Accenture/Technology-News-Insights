(Gray News) – McDonald’s is giving away free fries every Friday for the rest of 2023 – talk about fry-yay! The fast-food restaurant is offering free medium fries to reward members with any $1 purchase made through the McDonald’s app on Fridays through Dec. 31. Reward members can redeem their free fries from participating locations once every Friday. Once you’ve downloaded the McDonald’s app, go to the deals tab, select the Free Friday deal and tap “add deal to mobile order.” Then, make your payment using any major credit card and pick up your order curbside or at your nearest McDonald’s drive-thru.
