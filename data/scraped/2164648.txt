(NYSE: PAG), a diversified international transportation services company and one of the world's premier automotive and commercial truck retailers, today announced quarterly results for the first quarter of 2023. For the quarter, revenue increased 5% to $7.3 billion, a quarterly record.

First Quarter 2023 Operating Highlights Compared to First Quarter 2022 (Percentage Change Excluding Foreign Currency Exchange Shown in Parenthesis) Commenting on the Company's financial results, Chair and CEO Roger Penske said, "I am pleased to report a strong first quarter. Despite higher interest costs, inventory challenges, and other inflationary cost pressures, our performance continues to demonstrate the benefits of the Company's diversification and the strength of its business model. Automotive retail and commercial truck retail demand for new vehicles remains strong while same store service & parts revenue increased 14% from retail automotive operations (excluding changes in foreign currency exchange) and increased 11% from commercial truck operations. In addition, I am pleased that strong expense control produced a ratio of SG&A to gross profit of 67.5%, including a sequential decline of 140 basis points when comparing the first quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2022." Retail Automotive Dealerships For the three months ended March 31, 2023, total retail automotive revenue increased 4% to $6.3 billion. Same-store revenue increased 2%, including a 10% increase in service and parts revenue. Total retail automotive gross profit increased 1% to $1.1 billion, including a 2% decrease on a same-store basis. Same-store service and parts gross profit increased 9%. Excluding the impact from foreign currency exchange, total retail automotive revenue increased 9% (same-store +6%) and total retail automotive gross profit increased 5% (same-store +2%). Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we transitioned certain brands in the U.K. to an agency model for new vehicle sales under which these dealerships receive a fee for facilitating the sale of a new vehicle by the manufacturer. We do not record revenue for the price of the vehicle. As shown in the following schedules, the units facilitated under the agency model are shown separately as Agency units while the fee we received to facilitate the sale is included in new vehicle gross profit. Retail Commercial Truck Dealerships  As of March 31, 2023, Premier Truck Group operated 39 North American retail commercial truck locations. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, revenue increased 13% to $895.6 million. Same-store revenue increased 10%, including an 11% increase in service and parts. Earnings before taxes decreased 2% to $57.1 million when compared to the same period in 2022. Penske Transportation Solutions Investment Penske Transportation Solutions ("PTS") is a leading provider of full-service truck leasing, truck rental, contract maintenance, and logistics services. Penske Automotive Group has a 28.9% ownership interest in PTS and accounts for its ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded $80.8 million in earnings compared to $118.5 million for the same period in 2022 due to higher interest costs, a decrease in rental utilization, and a decrease in the gain on sales of vehicles. During the first quarter, PTS continued to expand its managed fleet with over 419,000 trucks, tractors, and trailers under lease, rental, and/or maintenance contracts. Corporate Development and Capital Allocation During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock for $110.2 million under our securities repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors.
