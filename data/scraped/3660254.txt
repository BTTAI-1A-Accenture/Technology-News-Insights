India’s private space sector has finally begun to see some movement with several startups looking to tap into what is estimated to be a $100 billion market by 2040. Skyroot is among the forefront of the new-age space race as it launched India’s first private rocket.   With the government backing and a positive response from investors, space-focused companies like Skyroot have tremendous potential, which we may see materialize in a few years. For now, the Hyderabad-based startup has remained at a pre-revenue stage (until FY23). The five-year-old startup posted a revenue of Rs 40 lakh while its losses touched Rs 55 crore, according to its annual financial statement filed with the RoC.  Skyroot’s losses are apparent as the company has been investing heavily in infrastructure.
