			Trending:		 Betta Gumbo has returned to downtown Loveland roughly a week after owner Clay Caldwell closed the restaurant down and reopened it as a pop-up steakhouse spot. At the end of July, Caldwell announced that he would be transitioning Betta Gumbo, which has operated in Loveland for a decade, into a steakhouse in its location in The Foundry, 277 N. Lincoln Ave. Caldwell said at the time the plan was to open as a pop-up restaurant with the same décor the restaurant already had and re-evaluate several weeks later as to how the steakhouse did. Caldwell announced the return in a video posted earlier this week to the Betta Gumbo Facebook page. He said in the video they had great reviews and the product was “spot-on” at the pop-up steakhouse, but after getting hundreds of requests from people — adding that they were “both very pointed and in a sweet manner” — he had decided to bring back the old restaurant and take the steak opportunity elsewhere; the change took effect Thursday. “We appreciate all the comments and we understand your panic,” he said in the video. “We were ready to do something new and you said no. The people spoke, and we are going to give you what you asked for.” Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group
