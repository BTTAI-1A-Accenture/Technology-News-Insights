AI, or artificial intelligence, is technology that attempts to simulate human cognitive function. AI has made its way into the software development space in a number of ways. Visit the AI article list to expand your AI knowledge. Learn More Observability is a way for development teams in an organization to view their program state. Failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures. Read about the latest observability content here Learn More In the past, the CI/CD pipeline was simply a place to integrate code. Developers would write their code in GitHub, pass it through the pipeline, and then deploy it. The pipeline has become a much more critical piece of the software delivery lifecycle today. Learn More Modern cloud-native applications, often leverage microservices, containers, APIs, infrastructure-as-code and more to enable speed in app development and deployment Learn More Sponsored By: Always On, Always Fast Deploy Distributed PostgreSQL in just 90 Seconds Learn More  The Importance of Security Testing With more development teams today using open-source and third-party components to build out their applications, the biggest area of concern for security teams has become the API. This is where vulnerabilities are likely to arise, as keeping on top of updating those interfaces has lagged. Read the Guide Here Mobile App Testing involves analyzing mobile apps for functionality, usability, visual appeal, and consistency across multiple mobile devices. It helps ensure an optimal user experience, irrespective of the device used to access the app. Learn More Today’s distributed software environments incorporate a variety of APIs with every interface your software touches, from mobile to microservices. Each API has to be continuously tested and verified to ensure your software functions as it should. Parasoft’s API testing platform makes quick, efficient, and intelligent work of such requirements. Learn More Ensure your application’s resilience, and make sure your software performs as expected under diverse operating conditions. (sponsored by Parasoft) Learn More    DevSecOps is the DevOps community’s approach to bringing security into the development lifecycle. Businesses want to deliver software, but cannot afford to release unreliable or insecure applications— therefore security needs to be baked in much sooner than it has traditionally been. Learn More Securing an application is just as important as building it in the first place. As data becomes more valuable, there are more people who want to steal it and use it for their own personal gain. Making sure applications are indeed secure has always been a challenge, as hackers try to stay one step ahead of defenders. Learn More Secrets are essential for integrating your infrastructure with databases and SaaS services. Doppler‘s developer-first security platform empowers teams to manage, orchestrate, and govern secrets across any environment. In 2023, there was an 18% decline in the number of open-source projects that are considered to be “actively maintained.” This is according to Sonatype’s Annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report. Learn More Development Managers need a different type of content than developers… They need to know what platforms, tools, trends, and issues they should be thinking about. SD Times delivers those unique topics here Learn More Agile software development has been around since the 1990s, but didn’t get the name until the famous meeting of 17 renowned software development thought leaders at Snowbird, Utah resulted in an Agile Manifesto. The idea behind Agile software development is to reduce time to market by enabling faster iterations of smaller segments of software. Learn More Value stream management involves people in the organization to examine workflows and other processes to ensure they are deriving the maximum value from their efforts while eliminating waste — of resources, time and assets. It is the practice that truly brings the business side and IT side together as partners in creating value for the organization. Learn More Learn More DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. Learn More Gravitee helps organizations manage and secure their entire API lifecycle with solutions for API design, management, security, productization, real-time observability, and more.

Learn More LogDNA announced a new browser logging capability designed to enable full-stack and front-end developers to ingest frontend log data into LogDNA more efficiently to debug web applications. The new feature automatically captures errors and logs occurring in the user’s browser and allows dev teams to centralize those errors alongside server-side logs, according to the company. “Customers struggle to extend their observability stack into their frontend web applications to monitor for client-side errors and collect critical debugging information,” said Peter Cho, the vice president of product, LogDNA. “LogDNA Browser Logger makes it quick and painless to find and fix issues that span between frontend and backend applications so developers can spend less time debugging and more time on value-adding tasks.” The biggest change in Rust 1.52.0 version according to the developer behind the language is enhanced tooling support for Clippy.  Previously, running ‘cargo check’ followed by ‘cargo clippy’ wouldn’t actually run Clippy, and the issue has since been fixed, meaning that users can get the expected behavior regardless of the order in which they run the commands.  Additional details on the stabilized APIs in this release are available here. Google’s newly added safety section will give transparency into how apps are using data.  It now highlights whether the app has security practices like data encryption, whether it follows the Families policy, whether users have a choice in sharing it, if it’s verified by an independent third party and more.  Developers will have to explain the type of data that is collected and stores and show how the data is used and the deadline for all new and existing apps to declare information will be in Q2 2022.  Additional details are available here. The Zammo conversational AI platform allows businesses to engage and transact with customers on voice assistants, interactive voice response telephony and popular chatbot channels.  “Voice-enabled communication is better for everyone. Not only is it more efficient for the business, but it also makes information more accessible, creating a more inclusive society,” said Alex Farr, the CEO and founder of Zammo.ai. “Until now, the problem has been how to get businesses there. Zammo makes conversational AI a reality for all organizations.” Zammo delivers operational efficiency in contact centers, as well as across marketing, sales, HR and customer service, according to the company.  Huntress raised $40 million to enable the company to expand its cybersecurity platform.  The platform enables businesses to identify and eliminate attackers who bypassed preventative tools and are hiding within exposed IT environments.  “Until small businesses and mid-market firms can improve their security posture, they’ll remain prime targets for attackers,” said Kyle Hanslovan, the founder and CEO at Huntress. “These growth-driven partnerships ensure we can continue challenging tomorrow’s attackers, by accelerating our roadmap and evolving to meet new and diverse threats. And, importantly, minority investments allow us to laser-focus on securing our partners without sacrificing the values which enable our team to defend the channel.”
