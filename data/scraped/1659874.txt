The film centres on a young boy, Ranti, who lives in Lagos and wants to grow taller before the next school term. The film captures his journey as he is forced to believe in the one thing he hates the most— beans. Founded by Adeoyin Okuboyejo and Ayobami Bello, with artistic and creative direction by Kiitan Durosinmi-Etti, the studio says it seeks to create, develop and produce magnificent and compelling stories of African heritage, using ground-breaking technology. In a statement sent to Sunday Scoop, Okuboyejo, who is the Chief Executive Officer of the studio, said, “We are very excited about this new production. It is an amazing and relatable story, produced in 3D animation and 4K quality. Our parents always said, ‘Eat beans and you will grow’. It is that myth that inspired the story. Also, the soundtrack of the film is stellar, sweet and communicates the story in the most amazing way. We are really ecstatic to share what we have been working on with the world.” The company also stated that it has its eyes set on building the ‘Disney-Pixar of Africa’, with focus on creating personable and relatable African stories in the most entertaining and educative way.
