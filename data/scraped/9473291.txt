About Us Advertise KOTA KINABALU, March 24 — A Japanese tailor has gone viral online after reaching the summit of Mount Kinabalu, 4,095 metres above sea level, yesterday in a stylish blue suit and leather shoes. Nobutaka Sada, 49, said in a Facebook post that he successfully climbed Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in Borneo, in a custom-made Sada suit. “A mountain higher than Mt Fuji with an altitude of 4,095m! In addition, we stayed in a hut on the middle of the mountain, climbed up a steep climb in the starlight, and were able to see the sunrise at the top of the mountain,” he shared. He said despite the altitude difference of 2,300 metres in tropical humidity and rain, his suit managed to hold up so well he could have attended a business meeting.   “Sada’s custom-made suits are safe to climb Mt Kinabalu,” he said. He added that he will upload the video of his latest adventure on his YouTube channel @ordersuitSADA, where he has chronicled various outdoor activities from skiing to fishing and diving in a Sada suit. Sada added that at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport Immigration counter on his way home, he was asked about his Mount Kinabalu climb in a suit. “I looked it up and found that a local porter uploaded a video of me on TikTok and got a little buzz,” he said. — Borneo Post Online
