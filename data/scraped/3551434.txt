MOSCOW, February 27. /TASS/. The West is running out of targets for imposing new anti-Russian sanctions, but it will still continue its sanctions policy, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday. "It is obvious that they (the West - TASS) have a certain deficit in choosing targets for sanctioning, which explains the illogical inclusion of certain individuals or legal entities in the lists," he said. "Clearly, this practice will continue, and new legal entities and individuals will be added to the lists in a ridiculous manner," Peskov believes. Earlier, the European Union imposed the 10th package of sanctions on Russia, placing restrictions on Russian Human Rights Council Valery Fadeev, surgeon Leonid Roshal, head of the Federal Agency for the Commonwealth of Independent States Affairs, Compatriots Living Abroad, and International Humanitarian Cooperation Evgeny Primakov, Deputy Prime Minister of the Moscow Region Vyacheslav Dukhin, Russian Human Rights Commissioner Tatiana Moskalkova, as well as 82 other Russian nationals.
