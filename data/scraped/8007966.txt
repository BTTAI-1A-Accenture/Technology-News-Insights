  Burnden Road Runners members were out in force at Bolton to offer well-wishes to parkrun power couple, Linda O’Byrne and Gareth Doherty, last weekend who were marrying in the Lake District the day after Saturday’s parkrun.
 
  Now Mr and Mrs Doherty, the couple were overwhelmed as cheers and applause greeted their arrival dressed in runners’ versions of a wedding dress and groomsman’s suit - not forgetting Jacob the dog in a fancy necktie.
 
  As well as celebrating the super couple, Burnden had some newcomers to cheer on to the finish. Suzie Disley finished her very first parkrun in 37mins and Joanne Eddleston completed her first at Bolton in 36:36.

  Seasoned triathlete, Tim Taylor, was off on his challenges again as he took on the Castle Howard Olympic Triathlon. Mirroring the Olympic race distances, stunning Yorkshire countryside and Howardian Hills, as well as a thrilling finish in the castle grounds, awaits athletes of this race. Unfortunately for Tim, the bike leg of the race was cancelled due to dangerous road conditions but he still enjoyed the 1500m swim section in the Great Lake where he finished the distance in 37:57 before completing the 10.5K run in 1:00:10. He described the run as ‘a wonderful route with lots of mud’ and the day as ‘disappointing’ (with the cancelled bike leg) but ‘a great day in the Yorkshire drizzle’.
 
  Burnden put forth a special group of hobbits for this year’s Tolkien Trail around Little Mitton. Alyson Cullen, Martin Cullen and Carolyn Edwards set off on a quest to find the finish line and take home their own ‘precious’ medal.
 
  The 11k trail is a popular feature on the race calendar and is held in both the summer and winter seasons. It is a spellbinding mix of enchanting woods, fields, muddy trails and road as runners follow a path of inspiration for Lord of the Rings author, J.RR Tolkien.
 
  Martin Cullen was first hobbit home in 59:27, followed by Carolyn Edwards (1:14:53) and Alyson Cullen (1:22:41).
 
  The third edition of the Sale Sizzler was up and running this week and taking on the fast and flat route was Lyall Mew, who is on fire this season as he prepares for a potential Ironman race in 2024. Just weeks after his previous PB of 20:00 at Sale, Mew smashed that out of the park with 19:39. Andy Dunleavy claimed second V65 in 20:18 and Luke Newell proved he was a natural in the Burnden vest as he smashed his PB to take 26:08. Cheryl Dunleavy also set a new goal with her best 5K PB in 2023 since February, with 33:48.
 
  Starting and finishing at the Wythenshawe Park Track, the 5K is a popular race and Sale Harriers themselves have produced many Olympians from their headquarters at the Track.
 
  Burndener Michael Kermode does not let the grass grow between his races - each week setting new PBs and trying out new courses. This time it was the Aintree Half Marathon and he completed the four laps in a PB of 1:37:00.
 
  Tony Fulop chose an unusual course this week as he flew the flag for Burnden on the Tittesworth Trail. Taking on the 10K and starting at the beautiful Tittesworth Reservoir, it was no mean feat as he had to trek three miles up Hen Cloud with some rock climbing before descending three miles to the finish line. Stunning views of the Peak District and challenging terrain kept Fulop smiling and he finished in a terrific 1:50:23.
