The Miami Heat made the Eastern Conference finals last year and the NBA Finals in 2020.  Despite the success, there are still those who believe the Heat roster has run its course. Former NBA star Tracy McGrady harshly criticized them during a recent appearance on TNT's postgame show.  McGrady said the Heat should consider a rebuild.   "They don't have great athleticism. They're a slow team. They don't have many one on one players that a lot of other teams have to create shots and create for others." After showing hope, the Heat have lost three straight and are in danger of having to participate in the play-in tournament. The Heat are 1.5 games back of the Brooklyn Nets for the No. 6 seed.   "They got to revamp this," McGrady said. "... Without Jimmy Butler, they don't have great athleticism on their team, I think they're a slow team and for the players that they have, they need someone to get them shots."
