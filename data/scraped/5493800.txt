He warned that any future government would take strong action against those responsible for the "capture" of institutions. He said, "A disease has entered the Indian institutional framework where the neutrality of these institutions has gone out of the window. I think we will have to make examples of people.  He further added, "We will have to make sure that some of the people who have done what they have done, pay a significant price for what they have done... so that anyone who thinks about doing it again knows that they will also pay the price for attacking the soul of india. It's an attack on soul of India."  Rahul also expressed his belief that religious violence in India could be stopped if the Prime Minister desired it.  Furthermore, he stated that the actions of the BJP do not align with Hinduism, as he had extensively studied Hinduism and found no teachings advocating violence against the weak.
