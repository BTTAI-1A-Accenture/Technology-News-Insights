Six of them were follow-up inspections after a previously failed inspection, with one food truck still scoring 65 red points, which are given for the more serious violations. The health district’s food safety team gave passing grades on 48 inspections, including awarding 15 perfect scores. In the district’s routine inspections, businesses or organizations that receive at least 35 points for the more serious red violations are required to have additional inspections and must meet a tougher standard on those. To pass followup inspections, they must have fewer than 25 red points and fewer than 10 red points for previous issues. Red violations are those most likely to cause food-borne illnesses, such as improper temperature control of food, lack of handwashing or bare-hand contact with foods. Blue violations are low risk factors related to the cleanliness and physical condition of an establishment. No notice is given before the inspections. Inspection results are posted online so residents can look up the status and the details of any violations of individual restaurants or check other businesses. Go to bit.ly/BFHDinspections.
