 Why do we need change in the Construction industry? Cement-based concrete has shaped the way we build in the 20th and 21st centuries, this lead to the linear value chain of take, make, and waste on a global scale. The building and construction industry is responsible for 39% of global emissions. To produce 1 ton of concrete, 600 liters of water is needed in our arid country, water is one of our most precious resources.  How can we make a change? To preserve our planet, we need to transform the entire economic system away from “take, make, waste” to a circular economy. A circular economy is based on the principles of waste and pollution design layouts, keeping products and materials in use, while regenerating natural systems. Today our technology already saves about 60% of carbon emissions compared to conventional building methods – with more potential to become carbon neutral. Why use Polycare Modular Building Technology? With different types of blocks made from local materials, all straight wall configurations can be easily built in any geometry by unskilled workers in a fraction of the time. The Polycare software Polybuilder makes it possible to transfer every structure plan into the system to determine the optimum set of Polyblocks for the specific project. The program also delivers all relevant information for the downstream processes such as production, logistics, delivery, and statics. Build affordable, sustainable, and circular!
