Updated: Mar 2, 2024, 5:32pm A real estate CRM is a customer relationship management (CRM) system that helps manage all communications with both leads and clients. CRM tools are becoming more important to the daily work of real estate agents and the success of their brokerages every year. The best real estate CRM will be specific to the industry with features, such as email and text messaging, lead follow-up tools and click-to-call capabilities. Many CRM platforms can be customized to fit the needs of real estate agents, even if they aren’t made specifically for the industry. However, there are some CRMs that are more effective for real estate agents. Forbes Advisor has put together a list of our favorite CRM software for real estate agents today, all of which are built for their specific needs.

The CRM includes rich messaging options and click-to-call, and you’re able to customize just about any field in your pipeline management.

 Follow Up Boss is a popular CRM tool throughout the real estate industry and has been an industry leader for a number of years. While we feel like other options have progressed faster, Follow Up Boss continues to offer great features that make it a solid choice. All messaging options are directly integrated within the software, including email, texting and calls. Its features, combined with the hundreds of integration options, make it customizable for just about anyone. However, if you don’t have strong tech capabilities you may find it difficult to use for your specific needs. Who should use it: Follow Up Boss is a good option for just about anyone with the tech capabilities to set up integrations and make customizations on their own. If you don’t feel like you’ll need a lot of customer support help, then you should give it a try. Starting Price  $129 per user per month Top Features  Large amount of built-in integrations, email automation options, transaction management tools

 Market Leader is a solid CRM option that takes marketing automation and listing management to the next level. All within the single platform, you can post your listings directly to your website and your network of clients will be alerted if the listing matches their criteria. While the value-add of automating a lot of your business can’t be overlooked, the pricing is unclear. You’ll have to reach out to the sales team to schedule a consultation and determine pricing for your unique situation. Learn more: Read our full Market Leader review.

 Propertybase is a full-featured platform that provides much more than just traditional CRM solutions. It is built to manage an end-to-end real estate business. It is a robust solution that can be more expensive than other CRM options and is really for a specific target audience of a larger brokerage or team. You can manage everything from lead generation to MLS postings and website development within the same system. Like Market Leader, the company doesn’t list pricing on the website and requires you to speak to a representative for details. Who should use it: Teams or agents needing more than just a CRM to manage their business will find Propertybase as a potential solution. If you’re managing a large team or brokerage, then this could be a great solution to streamline internal operations and communications and make working with clients much more effective. 
 As we were choosing the best CRM for real estate agents, we considered all of the factors that make the needs of a real estate agent unique and important. We looked at everything from pricing and ease of use to the specific real estate industry features that are available. Let’s look at the most important criteria that impacted our recommendations. We wanted to make sure that all the options on this list were affordable for what each offered. The value for the amount you’ll have to spend was weighed to make sure that each solution is a viable candidate to use compared to the competition. Additionally, we looked at the range of prices between plans and the value that each higher-priced plan brings to the user. We also looked for transparent pricing by a provider as some require potential customers to contact their sales department to receive a quote. This accounted for 10% of our weighted scoring. We looked for how the features meet the specific needs of real estate agents and teams. Real estate agents need more direct messaging features with easy access to history since some customers won’t provide repeat business for years to come. Being able to easily communicate with leads, prospects and past customers in different ways was a necessity. Other features we considered for essential included pipeline management, analytics tools, custom dashboards, document libraries, third-party integrations, mobile apps and multicurrency support. We weighted features at 55% of our total score. We researched reviews from real users to gauge their opinion of each platform. This entailed ranking both the overall score from customers and the number of reviews on site that included G2 and Capterra for these scores to give the fullest picture of reality and reduce bias. These accounted for 5% of the total score. Our experts preferred software that was not only easy to navigate and use without any customizations but also one that is easy to make needed changes without a tech team. Agents don’t have a lot of extra time to learn a complicated CRM system, so the more it just works with their natural workflow, the better. Other factors we looked at include value for the money, popularity and stand-out features, such as customer support. Many real estate agents don’t have access to a tech team, so customer support on all software can be very important. Whether you might need help setting up integrations or just to get the software running, customer support plays a big role in finding any software—especially a CRM that you’ll be using every week. Altogether, this analysis makes up 5% of the total score.

This makes it possible for your teams to create opportunities that will allow them to increase sales and create long-term clients for your business. Companies that need to nurture leads or create effective and positive customer journeys at scale use CRM software. Many startups manage leads and customers using spreadsheets. As they grow, however, managing a growing list of leads and customers manually can become overwhelming, leading companies to miss out on sales opportunities. A CRM offers efficiency and data storage tools that make managing large lead and customer lists easy. A CRM system helps real estate agents manage communication and activity with prospects, leads and customers. It helps you keep all of your contacts and communication history in one place so you can convert new customers and retarget old ones easily. The best real estate CRM should be built specifically for the real estate industry and help you streamline your prospect and customer communications. It should have easy-to-use communication as well as contact and lead pipeline management tools. Make sure that the CRM you pick is made for the real estate industry and matches your specific use case. The costs of real estate CRMs vary and can cost anywhere from $20 per month to more than $1,000 annually and many depend heavily on how many users you put on the platform. Most options have a free trial that lets you test drive whatever solution you think might be the best fit for you. There are plenty of cloud CRM solutions that information technology (IT) novices can employ. You don’t have to make a large investment in physical IT infrastructure or hire IT staff to manage your CRM. Many CRM solutions are available as software as a service (SaaS), which means that you only pay for what you use and can stop using it at any time.
