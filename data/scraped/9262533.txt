The one topic of discussion that has dominated global geopolitical discourse is the rise of China and its hegemonic ambition. The main reason behind China’s current dominance in various fields, believes author and China expert Michael Pillsbury, is that, for years, the US preferred China over India, transferred latest technology, invested heavily in it and helped the one-party nation grow by leaps and bounds. Conversely, the US blocked high-end technologies to India for decades. This skewed state of affairs is slowly changing, though the US is still investing in China, said Pillsbury. So, while an “India moment” is important, the “China moment” is still not a spent force, feels Pillsbury, who has authored The Hundred-Year Marathon: China’s Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.
