  Telecommunication giant, MTN has unveiled a new network code, 053. The newly introduced code will complement the already existing codes of 024, 025, 054, 055, and 059. Explaining the reason behind the new code, the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer of MTN Ghana, Samuel Addo, said the new code is aimed at connecting more people and businesses across the country, thereby bridging the digital divide. The new code will offer customers a wide range of services, including data packages and mobile financial services. The new SIM card numbers will be available at all MTN authorized sales points across Ghana. Customers are advised to be aware of the new code and to accept it for their activities such as making calls and sending SMS. Customers are reminded to add the relevant prefix to the number being dialed, for example, 053 and the customer’s unique number as international calls, customers will need to dial the country code, the prefix, and the customer’s unique number. MTN Ghana reminds its customers that its official number remains 0244300000 and urges them to be cautious of fraudsters who may take advantage of the new network code to engage in fraudulent activities.
