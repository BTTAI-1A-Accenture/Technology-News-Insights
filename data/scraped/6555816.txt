The 26-year-old has been Zanetti's go-to-man this season with Vicario conceding 40 goals in just 31 appearances for the bottom half of the table side. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, United are considering the goalkeeper as a replacement for David de Gea. Erik ten Hag is adamant De Gea will sign an extension to his deal which expires this month. However, he has been less certain about the role the Spaniard will play next season.

Meanwhile, Jack Butland will be returning to Crystal Palace while Tom Heaton's future is up in the air. Ahead of the summer transfer window, Zanetti was asked about his star man's future and unfortunately for Empoli fans he signaled his intention to sell the player. "I don’t think that he’ll stay here," the manager told the media after a 1-1 draw with Verona. "I think that after the two seasons that he’s had here, he deserves to go to a big club. My hope is that he can go somewhere to play at a very high level of football. "That’s where he deserves to be, and not just because he’s a great player on the pitch." It is thought Ten Hag would have to bid around €25m to secure Vicario's services. Reports suggest Jose Mourinho bid €15m to bring him to AS Roma but this was rejected.
