Bringsty and Shane Foley © Photo Healy Racing  Bringsty gave James McAuley another claiming winner when taking the opener at Gowran Park this afternoon. The Muhaarar gelding recorded his second success since joining the Naul handler when striking at 11/4 in the nine-furlong contest. Shane Foley  was on the heels of the leaders before challenging passing the two pole.  His mount hit the front over a furlong from home to record a two-and-a-half length win over long-time leader Khafaaq  “It's brilliant to get.  It's well known now that we have rapeseed growing beside us so they are struggling away,” said McAuley. “At Punchestown one bled and I'd say one of them probably bled there as well.  We're not running anywhere as many as we normally do and it's just trial and error. “We put a salt therapy machine in the yard and I'd say that's helping some of the horses. “We're coming out the other end, we can see it dying off and I'd say in another month it will be gone. “To be able to tip away with the odd winner between now and then is grand.”
