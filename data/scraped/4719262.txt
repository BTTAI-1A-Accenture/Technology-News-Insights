 Leap combines multiple features and tools in one place to make it easy to manage construction projects from proposals and bids to task and job management. The software was built by contractors, so the features you need should be there. Users can create tasks for employees, appointments with clients or subs and track the progress of all ongoing projects. You can create estimates and quotes, proposals and contracts, collect digital signatures and send invoices all from Leap. There’s no need to connect to third-party storage solutions—Leap offers unlimited cloud storage for all your documents, photos and data. Leap integrates with QuickBooks, Google tools and Zendesk, which increases the software’s functionality to a degree. The QuickBooks accounting integration is limited, though. You’ll be able to sync invoices between your accounting and project management software, but P&L will require double manual entry (in Leap and in QuickBooks). Although there is no free trial or free plan for Leap, it is an affordable option, especially for small contractors that have few users on the software. There’s a $500 one-time setup fee, which includes help from an account manager to customize your software for your business. The monthly cost is $65 per user—there are no tiers, so you get access to all the features from this one plan. Who should use it:Residential and home improvement contractors will find everything they need in one place at an affordable price with Leap. It’s one of the most complete construction project management software solutions available for small businesses. Learn more:Read our full Leap review.

 Fieldwire is a cloud-based project management solution that includes most of the tools you would need to run a construction business. It isn’t software made specifically for residential or commercial construction, and it’s flexible enough for use by subcontractors up to general contractors. Fieldwire lets each user create tasks, view plans and create or access digital punch lists, which saves a lot of time both in the field and the office. Having all your documents in one place makes it far easier to offer transparency to clients, so they can see timestamps, change orders and requests for information (RFIs), if requested. Fieldwire relies on you using a third-party storage solution, such as Dropbox, so you’ll likely have to pay for a storage app in addition to Fieldwire. There’s also no specific tool to create bids or proposals, but you can create custom forms and templates, so you can create them yourself and track in Fieldwire. There is a free plan available, which you can treat as a trial option to see if it fits your business. To use the storage app integrations with Fieldwire, you’ll have to opt for at least the Fieldwire Business plan, which costs $59 per user, per month, if paid annually. Paid plans start at $39 per user, per month, and go as high as $79 per user, per month (when paid annually), for the most premium tier of service. Who should use it: Whether you’re a subcontractor, general contractor or an architect, Fieldwire can be a good solution for every project you’re running. You can access any part of the construction project management software from the mobile app, making it an ideal solution whether you’re on the job site or in the office.

 Contractor Foreman follows the typical structure of most construction project management software—it’s cloud-based, so you can access it from your mobile phone, PC or tablet as long as you have an internet connection and the app. What sets Contractor Foreman apart from its competitors is its ease of use. Its user interface offers an intuitive flow, so you can easily get to your tasks, documents, client information, work and change orders, invoices and punch lists. It’s important to choose the plan that makes the most sense for your business. The lower-tier plans include most of what you need to run a project. The higher-tier plans include the financial features you may need, such as bid management, job costing reports, digital signatures and QuickBooks integrations. There is a 30-day free trial available, so you can test all the features to make sure it’s right for your company. Most construction project management software has a pricing structure that charges you per user, per month, but Contractor Foreman charges a flat monthly fee for a limited number of users until you hit the highest tier, at which point you can have unlimited users. Who should use it: Contractor Foreman covers everything from project management to financials, so you can run your whole business through one app. It’s best for smaller teams because of the limited user count. It’s super easy to use, but there’s also extensive help in case you need guidance with any feature. Read more:Check out our full Contractor Foreman review.

 Houzz Pro is a bit of a hybrid construction project management software solution. Its focus is on lead generation for small contractors or subs looking for individual projects, such as home improvement projects. However, it includes the basic tools you would need to offer proposals and manage orders, billing and invoices for landscapers, home builders and interior designers. Perhaps the most valuable features are for lead generation. On Houzz Pro, you can create a profile to showcase past projects, get lists of verified leads and reach out directly to leads to submit a bid on a project. Beyond the marketing features, you’ll find the cloud-based app lets you connect with your team and clients to offer transparency to all parties. Create proposals from templates, or make your own, set up a timeline so clients know when they can expect a finished product and deliver estimates and invoices—and accept payment through the app. You can also update to-do lists and track project progress in real time. There’s a free trial available for every plan. The Starter plan is $85 per month, the Essential plan is $129 per month and the Pro plan is $199 per month, but the most value comes from the high-tier Ultimate plan, which is $499 per month. One caveat to mention is that dissatisfied Houzz Pro customers are quick to post reviews. There are some good reviews for the service and software, but there are lots of negative ones, too. Not every user has gotten great leads, and many say that canceling a subscription can be difficult, at best. Who should use it: Small construction businesses that want more exposure, especially locally, and need an all-in-one marketing and project management tool. Users are limited in the low- to mid-tier plans, but they’re unlimited at the highest-priced plan, so keep this in mind when choosing Houzz Pro.

 As a general project management software, monday.com can work well for both construction companies and subcontractors. It’s a flexible option that’s easy to use and affordable, but you won’t find any industry-specific features or tools in this app. This is a simple and elegant way to ensure everyone on the team knows who is doing what, when each task will be done and the status of each task. There is a free version available that may be useful for a solo entrepreneur (though it allows for two users), but it’s a bit limiting. Paid plans range from $8 to $16 per user per month (if billed annually, with a three-user minimum), and with each tier come more useful features, such as automations and integrations. You can offer guest access to the app at the mid-tier level, which could be useful to show a client the progress of a project. Storage is generous, but not unlimited, so you may have to delete files or photos along the way as you add new projects. Integrating other apps through Zapier may help to extend the functionality of monday.com for your construction company’s needs, but you won’t get a lot of help with this unless you opt for the highest-priced plan. Learn more: Read our full monday.com review. Who should use it:If all you need is an easy-to-use project management app that lets everyone on (and off) the job site track the progress of tasks and projects, monday.com could be a good solution for you. monday.com’s free tier works best for individuals and pairs, while its upgraded service plans fit small businesses and larger enterprises alike. At Forbes Advisor, we compared more than a dozen of the top-rated programs for contractors and hundreds of data points to finalize our list of the best project management software for construction companies. Some software are ideal for large general contractors that need to manage subcontractors, clients and multiple projects at once, while others are suitable for small businesses that offer specialized construction services. We homed in on the criteria most important to all contractors, such as ease of use, monthly or annual cost and construction-specific features. All of the software we included offer mobile apps, so you can manage projects and teams from the field or office, financial tools for bids and proposals and/or integrations with software you already use for finances and invoicing. Here are some of the key data points we compared to rank the software. For pricing, we considered the starting plan cost of the software and whether a service offers a free trial. Companies that offer upfront pricing received higher ratings here than those that require filling out a lead capture form or making a call to a sales department. This accounted for 20% of our weighted scoring. While our reviews mention a variety of features attractive to small businesses, we maintained consistency in our ratings by looking for these general features for each provider: proposal management, timelines, software integrations, dependencies, proposal management and customer access to a mobile app. Additionally, we looked for unique features from each provider, such as costs tools, safety management, bid management, building information modeling support and client communication tools.  We weighted features at 40% of our total score. We considered what real users of the software thought about their experiences using them was also important, so considered what customers wrote about their experiences with project management software on sites that included Capterra and Trustpilot. We gave higher scores to providers who had reviews left on these sites that scored well (at least 3.5 out of 5). These accounted for 20% of the total score. Using all of the information mentioned above, our reviewers created a scoring metric based on additional criteria from customer reviews, such as ease of use, any stand-out features, popularity and value for the money. This final section made up 20% of the total score. Keep in mind that the most important features of any project management software for contractors include access, document control and ease of use. Consider these three features first when trying to choose the software that will fit your business best. Secondary to those factors, you should know whether you need project management tools only, or if you’re going to want to manage the financial aspects of your business in one software. Sticking strictly to project management features may reduce your monthly or annual costs but do this only if you already have a system in place for bids, proposals and invoicing. Integrations can help connect software you already use with your construction project management software, which can streamline your processes and save you time. The most important integrations would be with accounting software, email and calendars. Marketing and lead generation features are kind of like bonuses. You may not need these if you work for a general contractor with a department that handles outreach and presales. Smaller operations might want to consider construction project management software that includes some of these tools.  The Forbes Advisor list of the best construction project management software is a great place to start but you may find that software you’re considering didn’t rank. The best software for managing your construction projects may be more suitable for a bigger company—Procore is too high in cost for small businesses. You also might be in the need for something specific to home builders, such as CoConstruct. Managing a construction project requires project managers to stay abreast of costs, time, quality, changes, risks and progress of projects. Typically, they handle subcontractors, billing, invoicing and closeout, and they may be involved in bidding and proposals. There’s also usually some people management (in the office)—superintendents tend to manage those in the field. Contractors may use a variety of software to complete projects, including project management, building information modeling (BIM), bidding and estimating and invoicing or billing software. When selecting construction project management software, some features you want to make sure that it has include being affordable; a mobile app; tracking for your projects, including aspects like estimates, proposals and bids; task, project and invoice management tools; storage space for files and photos; messaging tools; and a free trial or free plan. For the best chance at success, every project needs an owner who is responsible for its completion and success. Project managers exist to fill this need, keep a team on task and ensure the project meets the needs of all stakeholders. This designation could be a subset of responsibilities—or an official job title. A diverse range of industries requires the skills of a talented project manager. You can be a project manager in construction, publishing, finance, professional services, utilities and many other industries. Despite the final result of the projects looking very different across these industries, the steps and skills to keep a team organized fluently translate across the business world.
