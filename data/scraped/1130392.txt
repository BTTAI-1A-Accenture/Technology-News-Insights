	Liza Pryimak and her mother set up "StandWithUkraine" accounts where the public can drop off cans and bottles, and all proceeds will be collected and sent to Sim’ya Ukrainian Society, who will forward it to Ukraine Canada Congress.

	“Some of our Ukrainian connections are fleeing to Poland,” Pryimak said. “Funds are going to the purchase of bulletproof vests and helmets for those wanting to return to defend their country, along with basic humanitarian supplies.”

	General Grants bottle depots are located in Sahali, South Shore and North Shore.

	“We are not able to take in giant orders because our location in small, but please come by and drop off a couple of bags,” said the owner of General Grants South Shore Bottle Depot.

	“You don’t have to wait in line or wait for them to be counted,” Pryimak said. “Just let the staff know what it is for, leave your bags and you’re done. Any and all donations are much appreciated by all of us here in Kamloops and people in Ukraine who truly need humanitarian support now.”
