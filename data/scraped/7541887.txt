Manchester police said a woman is charged after they found her baby boy in a Manchester wooded area. >> UPDATE (Dec. 27) -- Alexandra Eckersley appears by phone in court, pleads not guilty Alexandra Eckersley, 26, was arrested on a felony charge of reckless conduct as well as an unrelated charge from Concord District Court for endangering the welfare of a child. Manchester police said the boy was treated by EMTs and hospitalized at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Manchester District Fire Chief Jon Starr said the baby was exposed and in the cold.  "It was hard for our crews to deal with," Starr said.  Officials said at 3:30 p.m. the baby is alive and improving.  "There is no excuse for this," Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg said. "If you choose to live in the woods and choose to live your life a particular way and you choose not to accept our outreach, fine. But you don't get to do this to do what we are alleging to a child." Police said they responded at 12:40 a.m. Monday to a woman who reportedly gave birth in the woods near the West Side Arena. Authorities searched the area for an hour with Eckersley's directions but could not find the child. They said Eckersley, who is the daughter of baseball hall-of-famer Dennis Eckersley, then told investigators the baby's true location and led them there.  Investigators said the baby was in a large tent. There was a heat source that was turned off.  Crews said they had to hike the boy out of the woods for a fire truck awaiting them.  Officials have not said if they set a court date.
