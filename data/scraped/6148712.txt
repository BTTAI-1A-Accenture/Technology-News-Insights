Will she ruin Chloe and Mack's engagement? Emmerdale spoilers follow. Charity Dingle considers making a shock confession to Chloe Harris in Emmerdale. This week, Chloe and Mack announced their engagement to their family, and they also believe they may be expecting their second child together. When Chloe eventually discovers she's not pregnant, she panics that the only reason Mack wanted to get married is because he thought they were having another child.

It ends up being an awkward evening at the B&B for dinner when the pair are seated next to Chloe and Mack. To make matters worse, the motel's owner, Bob Hope, still holds a grudge against Liam for cheating with Wendy. Charity gets so upset seeing Chloe and Mack happy together that she ends up ruining her date by lashing out at Liam. The following day, Charity finds herself in another awkward situation when she ends up on the playground at the same time as Chloe and her son Reuben. Reuben suddenly runs a high temperature, and there are fears over his condition, leading Chloe to ask for Charity's help taking her son to the hospital. Charity does her best to comfort Chloe at the hospital as they wait for news on Reuben's condition, and the child is eventually given a clean bill of health. The two women use the situation as a chance to talk frankly about their fraught history, so Charity considers revealing to Chloe that she recently had a one-off fling with Mack.
