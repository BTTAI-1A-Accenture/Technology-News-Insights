Mr. Bux continued, "As a result of this support from the Government of Canada, the company will be well-positioned to commercialize an innovative and integrated cancer management platform. Our platform has universal appeal and we have interested international parties who are willing to engage with the Company. We are delighted and extremely grateful to have this financial support to expand our global R&D collaboration with leading institutions that are evaluating BioMark's early lung cancer detection assay as we are rapidly proceeding into commercialization phase in North America."
