                                 A few passing clouds. Low 71F. Winds ENE at 10 to 15 mph.  Updated: August 19, 2024 @ 5:25 pm  Editor Since its introduction in September 2022, H.O.P.E. Testing’s free public health vending machine has seen 1,284 registered users. Once a month, volunteers compile harm reduction kits and safer sex kits. A total of 11,612 kits have been distributed as of Aug. 22, according to H.O.P.E. This has included: Over the course of the year, SHOTS (a local syringe service program) has safely disposed of 196 pounds of sharp devices. The vending machine is available at the nonprofit’s clinic, 3354 E. 51st St. When H.O.P.E. opens the doors to its new facility next year, the vending machine will be available 24 hours a day, and organizers anticipate having to restock each business day.
