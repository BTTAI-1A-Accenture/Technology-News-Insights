 I hate to be the subject of a cautionary tale since that usually means I’ve done something incredibly stupid — again. It seemed like a good idea at the time, joining Indiana Road Runners for a romp through Yellow Creek State Park at Deer Flies 15k and 25k. I would gently trot through the 15k, book-ended by a few miles to make a long run and have plenty of company doing it. What could go wrong? After a foggy drive to the start, it felt good to stretch and check out the lakeside sights on my warmup. I was careful not to expend energy through the early miles of winding trail, but as temperatures rose, I found myself struggling to maintain even a semblance of running form. I reached the finish too spent to add more than a mile of cooldown at a walk. After I peeled away sweaty layers of clothing, downed a chocolate milk and several cups of water, I grabbed a couple of Gatorades for the trip home. My body had begun to cramp and I felt strangely chilled under the steamy sun. Unfortunately, that was only the beginning. I spent the next few days in a zombie-state huddled under a blanket on the couch, waking for fluids in, fluids out as I gradually came back from total exhaustion. I’ve had plenty of time to figure out what exactly went off the rails, how a simple, easy workout became a performance, then a health issue. I followed the trail of events that led to my ultimate collapse and found the origin in one simple word – dehydration. On the Sunday prior to Deer Flies, I had run more than 11 miles on hot, hilly pavement with less than adequate fluid intake, exacerbated by rehydrating with beer with the Hash House Harriers. During the week, I continued training but never got back to a full tank. Then, even though I sipped from my hydration pack and took fluids at Deer Flies’ aid stations, I couldn’t counter the volume of sweat lost by running in the sweltering heat. Eventually, my body just said, “Enough!” It's a simple lesson learned once more, this time in dramatic fashion. Fluids in, fluids out, more fluids in. Stock the fridge with healthy drinks and juicy fruits. Carry a water bottle more, a beer can less. And don’t assume your body will tell you when to drink up. My body’s an idiot. I checked in with John Swauger of Indiana Road Runners Club to congratulate the club on another successful Deer Flies and to preview this Saturday’s Run for the Trail 7k in Dilltown. Like Deer Flies, Run for the Trail is celebrating a lengthy success of about 15 years of running in support of local parks and trails. Proceeds from both events benefit Indiana County Parks and Trails as well as Citizen’s Ambulance. Run for the Trail has always been a 7k evening event. “It’s a great time of year for an evening race,” says John, “and it’s a nice course starting on back roads with the second half of the race on the Ghost Town Trail. It just happens to measure 7k.” A few years ago, Run for the Trail added a 2-Mile Fun Run/Walk to make it accessible to more participants. The 2-mile is non-competitive but timed. It’s a family-friendly, out-and-back completely on the trail with no street crossings. Run for the Trail falls at the beginning of high school sports pre-season training and several teams including Central Cambria cross country, Indiana and Northern Cambria soccer will vie for unique competitive awards of artisan-made wooden train engines for top 3 overall male and female finishers. Overall masters men and women also earn train engines while age-group winners from 12-and-under through 70+ earn gold, silver and bronze railroad spikes to honor the trail’s history. All participants in both distances may win random drawing prizes and enjoy post-race ice cream treats. Commemorative shirts will be available at race-day registration beginning at 4 p.m. for the 6 p.m. start. There’s a family discount for families of three or more. No dogs are allowed on the course, but strollers are welcome in the 2-mile event. For more information, visit indianaroadrunners.com or call race director Dan Pajak, 724-840-5961.
