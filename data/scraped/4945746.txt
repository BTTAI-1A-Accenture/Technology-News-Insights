Processing.... The Defense Information Systems Agency has launched a new cloud capability available outside of the contiguous United States. Now operational at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, OCONUS Region for Stratus marks a step forward in the agency’s work to establish a global infrastructure that links ground-based teams to each other, public and private cloud networks and headquarters, DISA said last week. The agency’s hosting and compute center has partnered with the office of the Department of Defense’s chief information officer and Special Operations Command to introduce the Joint Operational Edge program, another component of bringing OCONUS to the DOD. JOE is an interconnected network of large form factor edge computing systems designed to provide Platform as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service and other enterprise service offerings across the DOD. Compute offerings under the JOE initiative can be procured through the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract. DOD CIO John Sherman, a two-time Wash100 awardee, recently released a memo calling for military departments and other DOD entities to leverage the JWCC contract to purchase future enterprise wide cloud service offerings across all classification levels as part of a push to rationalize cloud adoption across the department.
