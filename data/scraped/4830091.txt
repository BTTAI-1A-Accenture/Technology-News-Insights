 For seniors who aren’t covered by a health plan at work, Medicare is nearly always the most affordable and comprehensive alternative. Five Military Benefits That Vets Might Not Know They’ve Earned But as good as Medicare is, the penalties for not signing up for it at the right time can be brutal, as a cautionary story in the Boston Globe revealed. In the story, Alan Cregg signed up for Medicare Part A (which covers some but not all inpatient medical costs) when he turned 65 three years ago. This was the right thing to do, since for most people there are no monthly premiums for Part A. Be a smarter, better informed investor.

However, because he was covered by his wife’s employer’s health insurance plan, he didn’t sign up for Medicare Part B for outpatient care or Part D prescription drug coverage. The trouble started when Cregg’s wife lost her job. Because she wasn’t 65 yet, she signed them both up for COBRA coverage through Cigna insurance. Believing that being on COBRA was the same as having employer health insurance, Cregg once again didn’t sign up for Medicare Part B. A year later, he needed knee surgery. Cigna initially said they would cover the costs. But after he had the procedure done, the insurer changed its mind, saying that he should have signed up for Medicare Part B and D instead of going on COBRA. Cregg ended up paying the entire $20,000 medical bill out of his own pocket. Even after paying, Cregg continued to dispute Cigna’s turnaround, claiming that the insurer never explicitly told him he needed to sign up for Medicare. A year later, Cigna finally agreed to reimburse Cregg (in part because of the bad publicity generated by the Boston Globe article). While this may sound like a happy ending, it really isn’t. Why? Because Cregg will probably still have to pay a surcharge on his Medicare premiums for the rest of his life. When you’re eligible for Medicare but are no longer “actively covered” by your company’s health care plan, you have eight months to sign up for Medicare Part B from the day you lose that coverage. Being on COBRA doesn’t count as “active coverage.” Neither does post-employment health care coverage you could receive through your retirement plan. If you miss this eight-month special enrollment period, you might not be able to sign up again until the next Medicare general enrollment period, which lasts from Jan. 1 to March 31 every year. Financial Freedom in Retirement Is All About Cash Flow And if you wait a year or more before signing up, you’ll have to pay a 10% late-enrollment premium penalty for each full year you don’t sign up. That penalty never goes away. You’ll also get penalized if you don’t sign up for Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage right away. Once your special enrollment period begins, you have two months to sign up for Medicare Part D. If you miss this deadline, you’ll pay a cumulative 1% penalty for each month you delay signing up. For example, if you wait a full year before signing up, your penalty will be 12% more than the standard monthly Medicare Part D premium. Like the Medicare Part B penalty, this one is permanent, too. That’s why it’s important to know when you should first sign up for Medicare and under which conditions you may or may not need to enroll based on your current employment situation. 1. Figure out if and when you need to sign up for Medicare. If you turn 65 and are still covered by your employer’s health plan, you may not need to enroll in Medicare. Whether you do or not depends on several factors. In either of the above scenarios, you’ll want to speak to your employer’s benefits administrator to get their advice on whether you need to sign up for Medicare (or not). Even if you don’t need to enroll, you may want to compare premiums, deductibles, copays and prescription drug costs of your current health insurance versus those for Medicare. That way, you can see if, from a cost perspective, one option makes more sense than the other. One other factor to consider: If you currently contribute to a health savings account (HSA) at work, you can no longer contribute to it once you sign up for Medicare. However, you can still use all remaining money in your HSA to pay for qualified out-of-pocket health care expenses. 2. Sign up for Medicare Parts B and D immediately if you’re no longer covered by employer health insurance. Don’t make the mistake Alan Cregg made. If you or your spouse loses your employer group health insurance for any reason and either one of you is age 65, enroll in Medicare within eight months if: If you’re eligible for COBRA coverage, you can still sign up for it even after you’ve enrolled in Medicare. In these situations, COBRA may pay only for expenses that Medicare doesn’t cover. And since COBRA premiums can be extremely expensive, it may not be worth it to double your coverage this way. 3. Don’t worry if you’ve signed up for Medicare and then get another job where you’re eligible for employer health insurance. Once you’re enrolled in Medicare, you should never drop your coverage even if your new employer offers a creditable group health plan. Should you sign up for your company’s plan, your medical expenses may be paid by your employer’s plan, Medicare or a combination of both. The issues around Medicare enrollment are complex, especially if you’re still working and need to figure out whether you should enroll immediately or whether you can put it off until you retire. Watch Out: RMDs Can Trigger Massive Medicare Means Testing Surcharges If your employer doesn’t have the knowledge to help you figure out what to do, consider contacting a local representative of the State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP).
