 Last year, I interviewed at a company called NinjaOne that was rife with politics, in the interview process. The hiring manager, a growth executive had questions about SEO and asked several market sizing questions, while her direct report erroneously thought that there are different types of SEOs e.g. technical, content and offsite and flat out told me, "oh, we are not looking for a technical SEO." #ridiculous #whyarethesepeoplehiringmanagers Here are the growth executive's questions: aka "take home assignment" I was expected to complete this over the weekend and I moved to the second round, where awkwardly enough, I interviewed for the position that the direct report wanted. I did what any good leader would do, I passed on the opportunity and told the individual, apply for the director role.
