 KUDOS TO THE current owners of this modern three-bed who worked with an architect to ensure whoever buys it will need to do little in the way of upgrading.  Extensively and cleverly remodelled, 2 Moyola Mews in Churchtown makes the most of its 151 m² floor area in term of natural light and flow. Coupled with a BER of B2 and you’ve got a home that is ready to walk into and beautiful to boot. Now on the market for €825,000, the rooms spread over two levels and enjoys an interesting courtyard setting behind with electronic gates.

 The ground floor is made up of three large and bright spaces, two living rooms and a kitchen and dining area, along with a utility room and a guest toilet. The kitchen is fully fitted with lots of storage and has quartz worktops and complementary recessed lighting.  Stylish yet hardworking features like the stylish Belfast sink with its swan neck tap and full larder press, along with the Rangemaster cooker and American-style fridge makes for space that’s no doubt a joy to be in. Add in an island unit with built-in wine colour along with access to the garden and it’s social, too. Advertisement
