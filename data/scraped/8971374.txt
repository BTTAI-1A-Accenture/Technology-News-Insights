Despite facing several long-term headwinds, Rolland said Intel has taken steps to reduce its free cash flow burn by implementing cost-cutting plans and reducing capex. Rolland praised Qualcomm for successfully refocusing on the midrange market share, benefiting from China's reopening as a catalyst.
