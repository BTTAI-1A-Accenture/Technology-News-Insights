and the state’s public safety agencies to deliver new
technologies to enhance community safety and resilience
throughout the state.Motorola Solutions has delivered
a new online reporting portal for Crime Stoppers Tasmania
that provides a quick, easy and safe way for the public to
share relevant crime-related information with police and
other public safety agencies.The portal enables
tippers to easily attach media files, including pictures and
video captured on their smartphones – a feature that
provides valuable insights and improved quality of reporting
for public safety agencies. The new system also shares
information more rapidly with agencies and first responders,
enabling them to make better informed decisions when
investigating crimes. The deployment also includes cyber
security support and vulnerability testing to help keep
public data safe.Crime Stoppers Tasmania Chair, Mr
David Daniels OAM, said the new portal enables his
organisation and the wider community to provide greater
value and support for public safety agencies including
Tasmania Police.“Crime Stoppers’ core purpose is
to support policing by providing valuable information that
assists investigations and makes it easier for frontline
police officers to do their essential daily work,” Mr
Daniels said.“Now, Motorola Solutions’ technology
is truly helping us to ‘put the public in public safety’
to create a safer Tasmania,” he said.



Motorola
Solutions managing director for Australia and New Zealand,
Con Balaskas, said providing Crime Stoppers Tasmania and the
state’s emergency services with better technology is
essential to making the state safer and more prosperous for
the future.“Crime Stoppers Tasmania is empowering
the public to share more information about crimes and
threats, while our new online portal is making it easier for
citizens to play a greater role in protecting their
communities,” Balaskas said.“The public can play
a critical role in protecting communities and making
Tasmania a safer and more resilient state
overall.”The deployment of the new online reporting
portal reflects a growing public desire for the greater
adoption of technology to enable higher levels of community
safety. A major global research study found that 89 per cent
of Australians want to see public safety transformed through
the use of advanced
technology.###About Motorola
