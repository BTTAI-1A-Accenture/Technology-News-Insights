Dublin-based software company pTools has signed a deal with Danish content management software (CMS) provider Umbraco that will see the Irish company further develop its web tools. Under the new deal, which was struck with the company’s digital design division pTools-Web, Umbraco’s content management engine will be integrated into the pTools CMS Platform, helping to drive innovation for its clients. Meanwhile, pTools CMS components will be distributed within Umbraco’s marketplace, extending their reach. “We are delighted to partner with Umbraco and we are seeing the benefit for pTools and clients and end users already,” said Siobhán Davoren, who heads pTools-Web digital design division. “We are future-proofing our CMS with partnerships and technologies that will enhance client websites and solutions at every level.” Both pTools and Umbraco are growing their clients in UK and US. Umbraco also has a significant market position in Europe. Chief executive of pTools, Keith Wood, said the deal would allow the company to focus on developing new technologies and bringing enterprise grade solutions at scale to its clients. “The ‘match-made-in-code’ aspect of the relationship is key, and this underpins interoperability between pTools and Umbraco from design development to support and managed services,” he said. Irish software company pTools offers a range of services through pTools-Web, from content management software implementation to managed services and support. The wider pTools group also works with government organisations, health and financial services on digital transformation. Its clients include the Health Service Executive (HSE), Irish Defence Forces and Elevate Bank.
