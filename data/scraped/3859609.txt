Arthur Williamson’s plea was made Thursday in Macomb County Circuit Court in Mount Clemens, the county prosecutor’s office said. A no-contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is used as such at sentencing. WWJ-AM overnight anchor Jim Matthews was found bludgeoned with a hammer in September in Chesterfield Township, northeast of Detroit. Authorities have said Williamson, of Pontiac, was a friend of Matthews’ girlfriend. Matthews’ girlfriend and the couple’s 10-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter were injured. The boy was also struck in the head with the hammer. Williamson will be sentenced May 31. The Associated Press © 2024 NBC UNIVERSAL
