ServiceTitan Unveils New AI-Powered Solutions to Revolutionize the Trades Industry and Equip Contractors With Powerful Tools to Run and Grow Their Businesses
 ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PANTHEON 2023 – ServiceTitan, a software platform built to power the trades, today announced a suite of new products powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to empower residential and commercial contractors with groundbreaking technology to supercharge their businesses. Powered by Titan Intelligence, the company’s own AI solution purpose-built for the trades, these new cutting-edge solutions allow its customers to automate, predict, and optimize across their entire business.

  
“Over the past year, the world has seen a dramatic acceleration in AI advancements and ServiceTitan is making sure that the trades industry will be at the forefront of this technological revolution,” said Vahe Kuzoyan, president and co-founder at ServiceTitan. “For far too long, the trades industry has had to play catch-up when it came to technological innovations. But ServiceTitan has flipped the script by ensuring every hardworking contractor has access to powerful AI tools at the same time, if not before, any other industry.”

 
Several of these new AI-powered products and more were announced today at Pantheon 2023, ServiceTitan’s annual user conference, including:

 
● Ads Optimizer maximizes the ROI of every dollar spent on an advertising campaign by educating Google Ads to focus on potential customers who are actively looking for service providers while avoiding users who aren’t. The feature also predicts which zip codes will have the most demand and automatically prioritizes ads for those specific locations.

 
● Dispatch Pro runs thousands of scenarios to get the right technician to the right job, allowing dispatchers to invest more time delivering a superior customer experience. Dispatch Pro’s algorithm also finds the best technician for every job based on the technician’s specific set of skills, recent sales performance, proximity to the job, and more – all to maximize profit.

 
● Integrated Financing gives contractors the tools they need to grow their business and protect their margins. The feature allows ServiceTitan’s customers to strategically control plans from multiple preferred financing providers on a single job, improving their customers’ approval rates. It also gives technicians confidence in offering plans that will ultimately win more high-value jobs easily.

 
● Second Chance Leads automatically detects unbooked phone calls from potential customers within minutes of the call ending, and specifically flags missed calls that the algorithm believes can be saved. The tool works in the background to identify missed opportunities so ServiceTitan customers don't have to.

 
“At ServiceTitan, AI means ‘Automated ROI,’” said Ara Mahdessian, co-founder and CEO of ServiceTitan. “We want to automate all the inefficient processes that steal precious hours away from contractors and their teams every single day, and at the same time provide actionable insights and powerful features to meaningfully grow their revenue. Our AI-powered tools allow our customers to focus their time and energy on what they're best at, and most passionate about - solving problems for their customers and delivering the best quality service."
