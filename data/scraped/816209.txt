"We have built a highly scalable Commerce Media platform, and are on track to achieve our business ambitions." Operating Highlights  1 Contribution ex-TAC, Contribution ex-TAC margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow are not measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.2 Constant currency measures exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and is computed by applying the prior year monthly exchange rates to transactions denominated in settlement or billing currencies other than the US dollar.3 Same-client profitability or Contribution ex-TAC is the profitability or Contribution ex-TAC generated by clients that were live with us in a given quarter and are still live with us the same quarter in the following year.4 Activated media spend is defined as the sum of our Marketing Solutions revenue, the media spend activated on behalf of our Retail Media clients, and the media spend activated by Iponweb.  Financial Summary Revenue for Q1 2023 was $445 million, gross profit was $182 million and Contribution ex-TAC was $221 million . Net loss for Q1 was $12 million, or $0.20 per share on a diluted basis. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 was $39 million, resulting in an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.46 . As reported, revenue for Q1 decreased by 13%, gross profit decreased 1% and Contribution ex-TAC increased by 2%. At constant currency, revenue for Q1 decreased by 9% and Contribution ex-TAC increased by 6%. Cash flow from operating activities was $42 million in Q1 and Free Cash Flow was $9 million in Q1. As of March 31, 2023, we had $338 million in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet.  Sarah Glickman, Chief Financial Officer, said, "Our growth investments are paying off as we continue to win new Retail Media clients. We are off to a solid start in 2023 with top-line growth and strong focus on driving organizational efficiencies, as we navigate a challenging macro-economic environment while executing on our company transformation to create long-term shareholder value." First Quarter 2023 Results Revenue, Gross Profit and Contribution ex-TAC Revenue decreased by 13% year-over-year in Q1 2023, or 9% at constant currency, to $445 million (Q1 2022: $511 million). Gross profit decreased by 1% year-over-year in Q1 2023 to $182 million (Q1 2022: $184 million ). Gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross profit margin, was 41% (Q1 2022: 36%). Contribution ex-TAC in the first quarter increased 2% year-over-year, or increased 6% at constant currency, to $221 million (Q1 2022: $217 million). Contribution ex-TAC as a percentage of revenue, or Contribution ex-TAC margin, was 50% (Q1 2022: 42%), up 800 basis points year-over-year, largely driven by Retail Media and the acceleration of our client transition to the Company's platform. Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income Net loss was $12 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: net income of $21 million). In the course of the first quarter 2023, we incurred $9 million in restructuring related and transformation costs. Net loss allocated to shareholders of Criteo was $12 million, or $0.20 per share on a diluted basis (Q1 2022: net income available to shareholders of $21 million, or $0.32 per share on a diluted basis). Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $28 million, or $0.46 per share on a diluted basis (Q1 2022: $34 million, or $0.53 per share on a diluted basis). Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Expenses Adjusted EBITDA was $39 million, above the Company's guidance, representing a decrease of 38% year-over-year (Q1 2022: $63 million). This reflects dilution from our acquisition of Iponweb and targeted growth investments, partially offset by higher Contribution ex-TAC over the period and planned cost reduction actions. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Contribution ex-TAC, or Adjusted EBITDA margin, was 18% (Q1 2022: 29%). Operating expenses increased 31% year-over-year to $205 million (Q1 2022: $156 million), mostly driven by higher headcount-related expense from planned investments, equity awards compensation expense, and operating costs from our acquisition of Iponweb, balanced with cost reduction actions. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 14% or $18 million, to $155 million (Q1 2022: $136 million ). Cash Flow, Cash and Financial Liquidity Position Cash flow from operating activities decreased 44% year-over-year to $42 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: $75 million). Free Cash Flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, decreased to $9 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: $69 million). Cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, decreased $36 million compared to December 31, 2022 to $338 million, after spending approximately $51 million on share repurchases in Q1. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had total financial liquidity of approximately $814 million, including its cash position, marketable securities, revolving credit facility and treasury shares reserved for M&A. 2023 Business Outlook The following forward-looking statements reflect Criteo's expectations as of May 3, 2023, amidst an uncertain macro-economic backdrop. Fiscal year 2023 guidance: Second quarter 2023 guidance: The above guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 assumes the following exchange rates for the main currencies impacting our business: a U.S. dollar-euro rate of 0.929, a U.S. dollar-Japanese Yen rate of 133, a U.S. dollar-British pound rate of 0.819, a U.S. dollar-Korean Won rate of 1,282 and a U.S. dollar-Brazilian real rate of 5.22. The above guidance assumes that no additional acquisitions are completed during the second quarter of 2023 or the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . Reconciliations of Contribution ex-TAC, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to the closest corresponding U.S. GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures; in particular, the measures and effects of equity awards compensation expense specific to equity compensation awards that are directly impacted by unpredictable fluctuations in our share price. The variability of the above charges could potentially have a significant impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release and its attachments include the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"): Contribution ex-TAC, Contribution ex-TAC margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted diluted EPS, Free Cash Flow and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses. These measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Contribution ex-TAC is a profitability measure akin to gross profit. It is calculated by deducting traffic acquisition costs from revenue and reconciled to gross profit through the exclusion of other costs of revenue. Contribution ex-TAC is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included Contribution ex-TAC because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions. In particular, we believe that this measure can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Contribution ex-TAC provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors.  Adjusted EBITDA is our consolidated earnings before financial income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, certain acquisition costs and a loss contingency related to a regulatory matter. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Adjusted Net Income is our net income adjusted to eliminate the impact of equity awards compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related assets, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, certain acquisition costs, a loss contingency related to a regulatory matter, and the tax impact of these adjustments. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted diluted EPS are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted diluted EPS can provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of our business. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted diluted EPS provide useful information to investors and the market generally in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and change in accounts payable related to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow Conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion are key measures used by our management and board of directors to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. Accordingly, we believe that Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion permit a more complete and comprehensive analysis of our available cash flows. Non-GAAP Operating Expenses are our consolidated operating expenses adjusted to eliminate equity awards compensation expense, pension service costs, certain restructuring, integration and transformation costs, certain acquisition and integration costs, and a loss contingency related to a regulatory matter. The Company uses Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-term and long-term operational plans, and to assess and measure our financial performance and the ability of our operations to generate cash. We believe Non-GAAP Operating Expenses reflects our ongoing operating expenses in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business. As a result, we believe that Non-GAAP Operating Expenses provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our core operating performance and trends in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across periods. In addition, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses is a key component in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, which is one of the key measures the Company uses to provide its quarterly and annual business outlook to the investment community. Please refer to the supplemental financial tables provided in the appendix of this press release for a reconciliation of Contribution ex-TAC to gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA to net income, Adjusted Net Income to net income, Free Cash Flow to cash flow from operating activities, and Non-GAAP Operating Expenses to operating expenses, in each case, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Our use of non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 1) other companies, including companies in our industry which have similar business arrangements, may address the impact of TAC differently; and 2) other companies may report Contribution ex-TAC, Contribution ex-TAC margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently or over different regions, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider these measures alongside our U.S. GAAP financial results, including revenue and net income.
