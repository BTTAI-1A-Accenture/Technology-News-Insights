Jane Street and Flow Traders hold a market share of about 80% in fixed-income ETF trading, industry experts estimate, giving them a significant head start in these fiercely competitive markets.But senior bankers are determined to end that dominance, which they believe is undermining their efforts to expand in other parts of the credit e-trading universe such as portfolio and algorithmic trading.“ETFs were a specialised product in the market for a long time and weren’t used by a lot of market participants. Banks were complacent and then woke up one day and realised ETFs are now actively traded,” said Alexis Besse, head of international fixed-income quantitative strategies at Jefferies, which is also investing in this space. “It’s definitely becoming crucial in terms of that pool of liquidity in fixed income. ETFs are getting bigger and becoming more relevant in the ecosystem.”ETFs have become an integral part of corporate credit trading in recent years – despite still only accounting for about 1% of the US$206trn global bond market at the end of June, according to BlackRock. Long frustrated by the difficulties in trading individual bonds, institutional investors have embraced ETFs as an effective way to dial up or down their exposure to credit markets in quick order, particularly during periods of turbulence such as at the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020.The number of clients trading fixed-income ETFs on Tradeweb’s trading platform has grown by a quarter since 2019 to 277 last year. This growing popularity among asset managers and hedge funds pushed up average credit ETF trading volumes in 2022 to equal 23% of the total amount of corporate bonds changing hands each day, according to analytics firm Coalition Greenwich. That has sent banks scrambling to catch up following years of neglect for a product they once viewed as mainly retail in nature.But senior traders say there is more at stake than merely grabbing a larger share of the bond ETF pie. Many now see ETFs as an indispensable leg of a self-reinforcing set of activities that – taken as a whole – will determine a trading desk’s ability to absorb client orders and recycle risks across its broader corporate credit franchise.“In isolation, it’s a product where we can do a good job market-making. But it's also part of a whole ecosystem of risk,” said Laurent Samama, head of flow credit trading for Europe at BNP Paribas. “If you want to trade credit in 2023 in a wholesale manner, you have to do the whole chain from a single bond to a portfolio, to an ETF, which also gives you a lot of flexibility in hedging and risk transformation.”Three is the magic numberETFs are one of a trio of businesses – alongside algorithmic and portfolio trading – that has revolutionised corporate credit markets in recent years. Computer algo programs have developed significantly to price odd lots of bonds in a fraction of the time that it would take humans. Portfolio trading has also accelerated, allowing investors to trade huge blocks of corporate bonds – sometimes up to US$2bn of hundreds of different securities – in the space of an hour.Algos, portfolio trading and ETFs fit neatly together to form a virtuous circle of activities, traders say, each providing a different stream of client flows and an outlet for risks that credit desks accumulate. That allows, for instance, traders to recycle corporate bond positions they take on through their algo and portfolio businesses through the ETF create-and-redeem process, which lets them swap the bonds underlying an ETF for shares in the product.This new dynamic has driven a surge in overall credit e-trading volumes, which have roughly doubled over the past few years to account for 40% of total activity in US investment-grade bonds in 2022, according to Coalition Greenwich.‘Improvements in technology are revolutionising the way investors access fixed-income markets,” said Jason Warr, global co-head of ETF markets for BlackRock.Dealers are increasing the breadth of bonds being quoted electronically into the thousands, Warr said, and developing program trading capabilities. “This broad inventory and portfolio trading is hugely complementary to a dealer’s ability to price and risk manage fixed-income ETFs and as such we are seeing these three areas accelerate together,” he said.Catch upMany banks have made significant headway in algo and portfolio trading, but still lag far behind in fixed-income ETFs. This is a space where specialist market-makers like Jane Street and Flow Traders have dominated for years, adopting a technology-driven approach to help process large numbers of tickets at razor-thin margins.The two firms see as much as 95% of fixed-income ETF trades, experts estimate, giving them a material information advantage over rivals. Jane Street and Flow Traders didn’t respond to requests for comment for this article.“There are huge barriers to entry. You compete with two extremely dominant players making it hard to break into it,” said Melvyn Merran, EMEA head of ETF, credit algo and portfolio trading at Jefferies.Some of those barriers are technical. Banks have traditionally housed bond ETFs in their equities divisions and it has taken time and investment to shift activities to their more natural home on credit desks. There is also the sheer volume of fixed-income ETFs in existence to cover – more than 900 at the end of June, according to BlackRock – although most activity concentrates in a handful of products. Adam Gould, head of equities at Tradeweb, said specialist market-makers have forced banks “to step up their game".“If banks are pricing individual bonds, portfolio trades, the ETF, they’re going to be natural buyers and sellers of credit a lot more because they can figure out the cheapest way to hedge,” Gould said. “And frankly, if they're not set up to kind of do all of this in one place, then they're going to be at a disadvantage on pricing relative to their peers.”Banks may be hard pressed to loosen Jane Street’s and Flow Traders' grip over fixed-income ETFs, but senior traders believe that is precisely what they need to do to remain relevant as credit markets evolve. Merran at Jefferies said that profitability has, in general, been a challenge in credit e-trading.“We think the answer is to realign and connect the books and products that contribute to all the liquidity avenues in this new ecosystem: having an ETF desk alongside an algo desk and a portfolio desk is the best way to do this,” he said. “We do believe this ecosystem is profitable, and that it’s very important to see the flow in one place.” Barclays, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among the banks looking to make up ground in fixed-income ETFs as part of a broader push to bolster their electronic trading offerings in corporate credit.The old guard faces a tall order in breaking the stranglehold that newer, non-bank trading firms have established over the US$2trn fixed-income ETF market over the past decade.

Merran at Jefferies said that profitability has, in general, been a challenge in credit e-trading.“We think the answer is to realign and connect the books and products that contribute to all the liquidity avenues in this new ecosystem: having an ETF desk alongside an algo desk and a portfolio desk is the best way to do this,” he said. “We do believe this ecosystem is profitable, and that it’s very important to see the flow in one place.” The number of clients trading fixed-income ETFs on Tradeweb’s trading platform has grown by a quarter since 2019 to 277 last year. This growing popularity among asset managers and hedge funds pushed up average credit ETF trading volumes in 2022 to equal 23% of the total amount of corporate bonds changing hands each day, according to analytics firm Coalition Greenwich. That has sent banks scrambling to catch up following years of neglect for a product they once viewed as mainly retail in nature.But senior traders say there is more at stake than merely grabbing a larger share of the bond ETF pie. Many now see ETFs as an indispensable leg of a self-reinforcing set of activities that – taken as a whole – will determine a trading desk’s ability to absorb client orders and recycle risks across its broader corporate credit franchise.“In isolation, it’s a product where we can do a good job market-making. But it's also part of a whole ecosystem of risk,” said Laurent Samama, head of flow credit trading for Europe at BNP Paribas. “If you want to trade credit in 2023 in a wholesale manner, you have to do the whole chain from a single bond to a portfolio, to an ETF, which also gives you a lot of flexibility in hedging and risk transformation.”Three is the magic numberETFs are one of a trio of businesses – alongside algorithmic and portfolio trading – that has revolutionised corporate credit markets in recent years. Computer algo programs have developed significantly to price odd lots of bonds in a fraction of the time that it would take humans. Portfolio trading has also accelerated, allowing investors to trade huge blocks of corporate bonds – sometimes up to US$2bn of hundreds of different securities – in the space of an hour.Algos, portfolio trading and ETFs fit neatly together to form a virtuous circle of activities, traders say, each providing a different stream of client flows and an outlet for risks that credit desks accumulate. That allows, for instance, traders to recycle corporate bond positions they take on through their algo and portfolio businesses through the ETF create-and-redeem process, which lets them swap the bonds underlying an ETF for shares in the product.This new dynamic has driven a surge in overall credit e-trading volumes, which have roughly doubled over the past few years to account for 40% of total activity in US investment-grade bonds in 2022, according to Coalition Greenwich.‘Improvements in technology are revolutionising the way investors access fixed-income markets,” said Jason Warr, global co-head of ETF markets for BlackRock.Dealers are increasing the breadth of bonds being quoted electronically into the thousands, Warr said, and developing program trading capabilities. “This broad inventory and portfolio trading is hugely complementary to a dealer’s ability to price and risk manage fixed-income ETFs and as such we are seeing these three areas accelerate together,” he said.Catch upMany banks have made significant headway in algo and portfolio trading, but still lag far behind in fixed-income ETFs. This is a space where specialist market-makers like Jane Street and Flow Traders have dominated for years, adopting a technology-driven approach to help process large numbers of tickets at razor-thin margins.The two firms see as much as 95% of fixed-income ETF trades, experts estimate, giving them a material information advantage over rivals.

Adam Gould, head of equities at Tradeweb, said specialist market-makers have forced banks “to step up their game".“If banks are pricing individual bonds, portfolio trades, the ETF, they’re going to be natural buyers and sellers of credit a lot more because they can figure out the cheapest way to hedge,” Gould said. “And frankly, if they're not set up to kind of do all of this in one place, then they're going to be at a disadvantage on pricing relative to their peers.”Banks may be hard pressed to loosen Jane Street’s and Flow Traders' grip over fixed-income ETFs, but senior traders believe that is precisely what they need to do to remain relevant as credit markets evolve. Merran at Jefferies said that profitability has, in general, been a challenge in credit e-trading.“We think the answer is to realign and connect the books and products that contribute to all the liquidity avenues in this new ecosystem: having an ETF desk alongside an algo desk and a portfolio desk is the best way to do this,” he said. “We do believe this ecosystem is profitable, and that it’s very important to see the flow in one place.” “There are huge barriers to entry. You compete with two extremely dominant players making it hard to break into it,” said Melvyn Merran, EMEA head of ETF, credit algo and portfolio trading at Jefferies.Some of those barriers are technical.

The C$575bn (US$420bn) “crown corporation” mandated Deutsche Bank and TD Securities to solicit questions for the event from global ESG investors. A manager of retirement funds for as many as 21m contributors and beneficiaries and a multi-currency global issuer of debt, including green bonds, CPP now hopes to... Mahle Metal Leve filed on October 8 for a follow-on stock sale, mandating Itau and Citigroup as joint bookrunners on an offering of primary and secondary shares. The Brazilian auto parts maker’s B3-listed shares plunged 15.6% on Monday to R$39.52, reducing gains for the year to 50%. Presumably, the offering would allow German parent Mahle to pare a portion of its 70% stake. Mahle took the unit public through a Brazilian IPO in 2005. In Q2, Mahle Metal generated Ebitda of R$254m (US$50m) from revenue of R$1.1bn, the latter up 9%. The big US banks turned in another stellar performance last quarter with surging net interest income, continued strength in trading and solid green shoots emerging in investment banking, led by momentum in debt capital markets. Citigroup's investment banking revenue rose 34% in the quarter as revenue from debt underwriting surged to US$403m, up 190% from the year earlier, when there were significant writedowns. Citi's revenues from equity underwriting rose 32% to US$132m as the initial public offering window opened in the quarter. Revenue... The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable should include representatives from a wider range of debtors, rather than just those that are currently facing debt distress, according to Reza Baqir, managing director of Alvarez and Marsal and former governor of Pakistan’s central bank. The roundtable met for the first time in April at the IMF and World Bank’s Spring Meetings so creditors and debtors could discuss technical issues to make the sovereign debt restructuring process smoother. Some current cases, such as Zambia’s, have dragged on for three... PagerDuty achieved a balanced outcome from its convertible bond refinancing, using the bulk of proceeds raised from the sale of a new CB issue to repurchase an outstanding bond offering with a limited negative share price impact. After a day of marketing, the software firm on Wednesday raised US$350m from a five-year convertible bond issue at a 1.5% coupon and 27.5% conversion premium, toward the investor-friendly end of the 1.25%–1.75% and 27.5%–32.5% price talk. PagerDuty used US$224.5m of the proceeds to repurchase US$230m principal of a... Mexico’s Fibra Uno is moving ahead with plans to take its industrial property portfolio public to capitalise on near-shoring trends. The REIT’s shareholders approved on Monday a plan to separate its industrial properties and list the portfolio on the Mexican stock exchange. US and international investors will get the opportunity to participate through an unregistered or private offering. Fibra Uno shares rose 1.2% to Ps28.75 on Thursday. The REIT first revealed plans for the IPO in early September, the stock having jumped from Ps24 since then... Just as the pricing of a German equipment lease ABS from abcbank was pushed back to Monday, Credit Agricole announced a roadshow for CA Leasing 2023-1, a securitisation of French equipment leases originated by Credit Agricole subsidiary LixxBail. Unlike the fixed-rate German transaction, the French deal is offering floating-rate senior notes to be priced over one-month Euribor. Meetings and calls are available from Monday. The simple, transparent and standardised deal is backed by a roughly €526m provisional static portfolio of leases with a... In mid-September, bank CEOs were talking up the revival of the IPO market. A month later, and the green shoots that they spotted have shrivelled and died. Last week, French software company Planisware became the second European IPO in a row to cancel, following hot on the heels of German defence company Renk. Birkenstock had shunned a listing at home in Germany in favour of the lofty valuations of New York, and in less than three days of trading had cost investors about US$300m of the US$1.48bn invested in the IPO. Meanwhile in Australia, three... London-listed Allergy Therapeutics saw low take-up for its rights issue that targeted investors not involved in an earlier placing to major shareholders, and underwriting picking up the rest. In April, the company said it was targeting £40.75m in equity through a combined direct placing and rights issue. The placing went to two of the company’s three largest shareholders, ZQ Capital and Southern Fox, subscribing for 2.2bn and 1.16bn shares, respectively, at 1p each, while the third, Abbott Laboratories, did not take part. The rights issue... US ECM activity is bound to remain light as third-quarter earnings steal the limelight in the next few weeks and investors lick their wounds from the poor performance of recent IPOs, though syndicate desks may still look to roll out some deals from the stalwart biotech sector. Wednesday's dismal Birkenstock debut, with shares down 12.6% and a further 6.6% fall on Thursday, underscored the lingering woes of the new issue market, where volumes remain well down on 2021 levels and a nascent recovery appears to have spluttered. Birkenstock's... Longstanding Irish RMBS issuer Finance Ireland Credit Solutions is lining up its first securitisation of prime auto loan contracts, Finance Ireland Auto Receivables No. 1, having brought the motor finance business onto its balance sheet last year after previously operating as an intermediary for Close Brothers. The company said in an investor presentation that it intends become a recurring issuer in the public markets. The debut transaction is offering Triple A rated Class A notes, Double A rated Class Bs and Single A rated Class Cs, backed... The SKr2bn–SKr2.3bn (US$179m–$208m) IPO of Swedish discount retailer Rusta was covered throughout the range on Friday, after opening books on Tuesday. The company’s founders and other shareholders are offering 45.5m shares at SKr43–SKr50 each, representing a 30% free-float. "We’ve made good progress in a challenging market," said a banker involved. "We launched on Tuesday with great momentum and continued to build despite the market." Books were covered within the first few hours of opening. A second banker said demand was a reflection of...
