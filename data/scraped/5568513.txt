Processing.... The Department of the Air Force has selected local utility services provider Eversource to implement a commercial energy delivery and usage model at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. The Energy-as-a-Service pilot program will run for three years to provide installation mission owners access to resilient and efficient energy management services while supporting the Air Force’s decarbonization objectives, Air Force Materiel Command said Tuesday. Eversource will partner with Ameresco and the Air Force Office of Energy Assurance to develop and implement an EaaS prototype to meet energy requirements at the military base. The Air Force is using an existing other transaction agreement to procure solar arrays and battery energy storage systems in support of the program. Penni Conner, executive vice president of customer experience and energy strategy at Eversource said the company is proud to provide an EaaS model that “leverages the best of today’s innovative technologies to provide resilient, sustainable energy service.” “The unique structure of EaaS allows the base to focus on critical operations while ensuring their energy needs are met through resilient and renewable distributed energy infrastructure,” said Nicole Bulgarino, EVP of Ameresco.
