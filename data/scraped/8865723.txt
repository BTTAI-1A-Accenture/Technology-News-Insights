 Arrow Transport and Logistics has added new Freightliner and Fuso models to its fleet recently. Historically Arrow’s wharf cartage fleet exclusively featured Mercedes-Benz trucks, particularly the Actros model. However, with an increase in operational demand and supply chain constraints at Benz’s end, Arrow Transport was unable to source all the Actros units it needed in time. The company ended up going with Freightliner Cascadia and Fuso Shogun models, in addition to the new Actros models, to meet its application needs. “We are dedicated Mercedes-Benz Actros customers because they deliver the advanced safety features, fuel efficiency, lower emissions and driver comfort that we demand at Arrow Transport and Logistics,” says Arrow Transport’s MD Craig Webster. “Although we were a little hesitant at first, we have found that the Freightliner Cascadia and Fuso Shogun products also tick the same boxes that we care about, even though they have different characteristics.” Webster says the Arrow drivers were unsure about the Cascadia and Shogun models at first but changed their opinion after using the new trucks. “They had some preconceptions about the Fuso Shogun, with it being Japanese rather than a European truck, but these were soon overcome and the drivers love them,” he says. “The Cascadia was also something different for us and we don’t usually run trucks with bonnets. But the feedback for both trucks has been overwhelmingly positive.” The Shogun 460 models are perfect for side-loader work in built–up areas and the visibility, maneuverability and performance have all won new fans among the drivers. Arrow uses some Cascadia 116 models for local cargo work and some Cascadia 126 sleeper cab models for longer runs. The Cascadia has a short nose and is also fitted with additional bonnet-mounted mirrors, which improve its visibility. Like the Actros and Shogun, the Cascadia also comes standard with a full suite of active safety features including AEBS and is the only bonneted truck in Australia with a steering wheel airbag. The inclusion of the active safety features was critical for Arrow’s needs. “We were an early adopter of active safety features like active emergency braking with the Mercedes-Benz trucks and we just wouldn’t buy a truck without them,” Webster says. “It is also reassuring that the Cascadia has a driver’s airbag and I was really surprised to hear it is the only one in that class that does.” Coming from the Daimler Truck brands, all of the units can be serviced by the same dealership network. Having bought the trucks under the Daimler Truck Financial Services (DTFS) guaranteed buy back package, Arrow Transport has the choice to return the trucks at the end of the finance contract for the agreed price, keep, or sell them. Arrow Transport and Logistics now runs 120 trucks that operate cartage out of wharf precincts in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland.
