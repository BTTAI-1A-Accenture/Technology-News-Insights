 Some friends were exploring the notion of time, or perception of it, recently. I read something a while ago that time, to more advanced races, is a measurement in the change of entropy. It got me to thinking about harmony, things in flow and the notion of accelerated results. It appears we might need them. It dawned on me that, based on current philosophy regarding creating our reality, how it might appear in a conceptual framework like the tesseract. It's an interesting model in it's constant ebb and flow from within to without. How might that fit in the understanding or how we might create reality and get better at it together? We think. How and what we think is a choice, though we might always recognize that choice in the moment. If you've had long-term dream-come-true events and wondered how it might have happened so you could repeat it, perhaps this will make sense. Innocence and naivety play a role, though not like you might expect. If we don't know what we cannot do, then it opens the door wide to possibility. In an instant of self-realization in a free state of thought, as in a brief moment of 'seeing' rather than visualizing, there is a subtle 'yes' at a sensory level, almost imperceptible unless you are self-aware.  That 'yes' is like an extension of attention, intention and interaction at an energetic level, sending a pulse into the thoughtmosphere. It happens so quickly we are barely aware, yet some time from now, or then as the case may be, our creation shows up for engagement. Will we recognize it?  After several events and a few years of paying attention to synchronicities, observant at a near-obsessive level, it becomes easier to recognize what we seek is also seeking us, like a tesseract of time. Paying attention to the subtle signals that prompt anticipation, the sense of something spooky cool about to happen inspires a sense of awe in the process. Expectations are conditional love in the sense of wanting to control our reality instead of anticipating events with awe and wonder. That doesn't mean we can't plan and strategize; just that our idea and how it shows up may be a bit different, though IT WILL SHOW UP! Expectations usually limit the response because of the box we create for the universe to fit in.  As we extend the 'sense' of what we hope to have manifest in our lives and do everything in our power to be present, do the work, and let go of control, magic happens. Well, it isn't really magic, it's thoughtmospheric action. There's science behind it, too, and running 'thought experiments' through the scientific method means it's about process, not results.  Results vary per individual. No two are like, though some may be very close, like meeting our 'twin flame' or achieving a life-purpose. Like the tesseract, we've projected our intention for the gathering of energy to manifest the best version of ourselves to meet the demands of the dream or goal. Then we let go.  Like the tesseract, the inner extends to the outer and draws it back toward us in the 'energy' of attraction and harmonization of our mind/body/spirit as ONE. The inner and outer are bridged, at least temporarily, in the achievement of the dream, goal or vision. It's a magic process supported up with a method. Let your mind drift for a moment and think about a really cool or profound event in your life and how it got set up by the breadcrumbs you followed. Just let your mind explore a moment. We create our reality. We usually aren't even aware of what we've done because of the time-lag in the intention and manifestation. To discipline ourselves enough to manage our minds and monitor our requests starts out like herding cats. Those 70,000 thoughts a day are mostly major distractions. What if you became more self-aware? I read a lot of stuff on fringe topics and a memoir that found its way into my thoughtmosphere last year has me wondering. Is time really a measurement of the change in entropy? How might that appear experientially? Does that mean the more resonant factors are, the less time it would take for the goal to be reached?

I wonder if you chose this form because Time is usually called the 4th dimension and that also is how we mathematically consider going from a point (0D) to a line (1D) to a plane (2D) to a cube (3D) to a tesseract (4D).  (Which is to say, that I can't really wrap my mind around the 4th dimension except in theory.)

And yet, your "yes" sounded oddly familiar.  There are so many instances of subjects coming together that I have learned to discard as just as likely being the consequences of LinkedIn's algorithms and that subject-wise, we tend to move in small tribes.  But then there are the other odd coincidences that make you sit right up and pay attention.  

Your question "Does that mean the more resonant factors are, the less time it would take for the goal to be reached?"  brought up the thought that resonance requires that elements can vibrate.  The ability to vibrate is the opposite of rigidity and stability.  I can't recall a period in my lifetime when the feeling of stability was as low as it is now, and I think I am not alone in that. Scary and exciting at the same time.   🌌 Spiral Wizard | 🐙 Transformational Coach et al | 🌎 Curious Conversation Creator | ✍️  30+ Amazon Published | 💭 360 Thought Leader 💭 | 🔮 Futurist | 🎉 Celebrator & Witness for Being The Dream!
