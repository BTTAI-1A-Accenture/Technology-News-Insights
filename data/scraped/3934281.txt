HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This release includes business updates and unaudited interim financial results for the three ("Q2", "Q2 2023" or the "Quarter") and six months ("1H 2023") ended June 30, 2023 of Cool Company Ltd. ("CoolCo" or the "Company") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).

 
Q2 Highlights and Subsequent Events
 
Richard Tyrrell, CEO, commented:
 
“During the second quarter, we achieved full utilization across the CoolCo fleet and secured well-timed growth through the exercise of our option on two state-of-the-art newbuild MEGA LNG carriers with deliveries in late 2024, newbuild pricing materially below current levels and committed financing in place subject to documentation. By exercising our option to acquire these vessels with scheduled delivery years well in advance of comparable newbuild orders, we are one of the few independent owners with availability in an early period of rapid expected growth in LNG supply. In conjunction with our three existing vessels that come into the charter market in 2023 and 2024, of which two are currently at rates well below prevailing levels, we have a clear path towards the realization of significant incremental value, cashflow, and continued dividend-paying capacity.
 
“With the approach of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, which is typically accompanied by a surge in LNG carrier demand related to both increased gas consumption and additional utilization for floating storage, trading arbitrage involving lengthy voyages to the Far East, and weather-related delays that soak up shipping capacity, the market seems tightly coiled. Moreover, the recent extreme volatility in gas pricing demonstrates a continued emphasis on energy security, as importers continue to put a premium on the commodity and the shipping capacity required to ensure security of supply.
 
“It remains to be seen how the coming winter will ultimately play out, but similar tightness of both cargoes and shipping capacity has historically presaged dramatic inflections in the spot charter market and provided firm support for both rates and charter durations in the more stable time charter market. As owners of modern LNG carriers that will be available for time charter employment through the medium term, we believe that our strategy of combining the certainty of long-term charter coverage with a measured amount of charter market exposure has the potential to shine in the quarters ahead.”

Note: As noted previously, the commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial tri-fuel diesel electric ("TFDE") LNG carriers, The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited ("Golar") were completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27, 2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30, 2022, with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the six months that commenced January 1, 2022 and ended June 30, 2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions of vessel and management entities (the "Predecessor" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions (the "Successor" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consist of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. We cannot adequately benchmark the operating results for the six month period ended June 30, 2023 against the previous period reported in our comparative unaudited condensed consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements without combining the applicable Successor and Predecessor periods and do not believe that reviewing the results of the periods in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance.

 
LNG Market Review
 
The average Japan/Korea Marker gas price ("JKM") for the Quarter was $11.06/MMBtu compared to $17.05/MMBtu for Q1 2023. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price ("TTF") at $14.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $58,500 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $10.91/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $69,250 per day.

 
The LNG market experienced typical seasonal weakness and relatively lower prices during the quarter, reaching price parity with oil for the first time since before the invasion of Ukraine. Shorter haul voyages to southern hemisphere markets increased, as is customary for the time of year. LNG volumes into Europe remained elevated by historic standards, as LNG replaces Russian pipeline gas and filled onshore storage. European inventory levels reached 78% by the end of the quarter and ~90% today. While the impact of these factors on the LNG carrier spot market was pronounced, the spot market continued to be populated almost entirely by sublets and this only affected CoolCo because of a single remaining variable rate charter. Owner-controlled vessels, of which very few are coming into the charter market in the short-term, have remained focused on time charters of 12 months or longer, where terms have remained largely stable at rates well above those prevailing in recent years, as charterers look to ensure access to carriers through the critical winter season in the northern hemisphere.

 
With the winter approaching, the supply of LNG carriers available for term employment remains minimal. The recent extreme volatility in LNG commodity pricing is indicative of a very tight supply/demand balance and the relative fragility of global supply chains still adapting to the sudden removal of large volumes of Russian pipeline gas that previously provided a significant proportion of the EU’s energy needs. Whether as a result of geopolitical developments, labor action, industrial issues, or the weather or congestion-related issues that the industry experiences with some regularity, it is clear that the fast-growing LNG market remains highly dynamic. In this environment, importers are prioritizing certainty of access to both the LNG molecules and the transportation capacity, rather than managing towards maximal efficiency and risking being short gas at a critical juncture. We continue to expect that term rates will remain strong and with the potential of sharp seasonal upswing in the spot market, we expect to fix our vessel coming available in September 2023 on attractive terms.

 
Operational Review
 
CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with no technical off-hire during the Quarter, resulting in a Q2 fleet utilization of 100%, unchanged from Q1. There are no drydocks planned for 2023, with the next drydock expected during the second quarter of 2024.

 
Business Development
 
In June 2023, CoolCo signed contracts with HD Hyundai Global Service, a ship service subsidiary of HD Hyundai Group, to retrofit five LNG carriers with sub-coolers for LNG boil-off reliquefaction units. The contract value is approximately $10.0 million per vessel.

 
On June 28, 2023, the Company announced that it had exercised its option to acquire two newbuild 2-stroke LNG carriers from affiliates of EPS. The Newbuilds are scheduled to be delivered from HHI in Korea in September and December of 2024. Each of the two Newbuilds is being acquired for an amount of approximately $234 million. The initial option exercise price was $56.9 million per vessel, resulting in a total of $113.8 million paid to EPS on July, 3 2023. The Newbuilds, named Kool Tiger and Kool Panther, are expected to be funded with a combination of cash on hand, including cash that was recently released from the sale of the Golar Seal, and committed debt financing.

 
CoolCo is in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking work for the Newbuilds.

 
Financing and Liquidity
 
In June 2023, the Company announced that the syndicate of existing lenders in the $570 million bank facility approved an increase in the debt amount of $70.0 million and a reduction of the interest rate margin from 275 basis points to 225 basis points. The $570 million bank facility's underlying, secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") exposure is fully hedged and the scheduled amortization has been adjusted proportionally for the increased size. The additional debt funding under this $570 million bank facility will fund the LNGe conversion of five vessels, including retrofits with sub-coolers for LNG boil-off reliquefaction under the recently announced contract with HD Hyundai Global Service.

 
As of June 30, 2023 CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $309.4 million and total short and long-term debt, net of deferred finance charges, amounted to $1,063.9 million. Total Contractual Debt1 stood at $1,179.4 million, which comprised of $504.4 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027, $481.3 million in respect of the four-vessel bank financing facility maturing in May 2029 (the “$520 million term loan facility”), and $193.8 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin).

 
During Q2, we entered into further floating interest rate (SOFR) swap agreements for a notional amount of $40.0 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility. Overall, the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 90% of the notional debt, adjusting for existing cash on hand, but excluding cash that was earmarked for the option exercise of the Newbuilds.

 
Corporate and Other Matters
 
As of June 30, 2023, CoolCo had 53,688,462 shares issued and outstanding. Of these, 31,254,390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd ("EPS") and 22,434,072 (41.8%) were publicly owned.

 
In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy, the Board has declared a Q2 dividend of $0.41 per ordinary share. The record date is September 11, 2023 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around September 18, 2023, while due to the implementation of Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway, the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or about September 22, 2023.

 
Outlook
 
Since the end of the Quarter, TTF has increased to $12/MMBtu and TFDE spot rates have increased to $120,000 per day.

 
In the coming years, the global supply of LNG is set to increase by more than 50% on the basis of projects that have already reached FID, of which at least 40 mtpa of capacity has reached FID in 2023 alone, equal to approximately 10% of total 2022 LNG production. In understanding the current 51% order book-to-fleet ratio (by volume), it is critical to understand that the order book has overwhelmingly been built on the basis of long-term contracts to service new liquefaction facilities, with the timing and quantity of their deliveries intended to match the commencement of new production. Furthermore, to the extent that project development delays result in vessels delivering to their charterers before their intended startup time, we would expect to see a dynamic similar to that which has recently prevailed, in which the market is sharply bifurcated between charterers seeking to fill interim periods in the spot market and owners such as CoolCo who are in a position to offer multi-year time charters. A number of additional liquefaction projects remain under development across North America and the Middle East in particular, but also in a wide variety of other geographies as there remains a strong and widespread desire to decarbonize by substituting LNG for the vast amounts of coal still being consumed, particularly in emerging markets.

 
Among LNG carriers currently on the water, the older, less efficient vessels in the charter market are expected to face growing competitive pressure over time, particularly among the steam turbine vessels that continue to make up over 30% of the global fleet by volume. The imposition of the IMO’s carbon intensity indicator (“CII”) rules from the beginning of this year, as well as forthcoming European carbon pricing set to come into effect next year, are set to increase the relative advantage of modern, efficient TFDE and 2-stroke tonnage such as those in the CoolCo fleet.

 
The limited supply of modern vessels available for time charter employment through the medium term is concentrated among a small number of owners, including CoolCo. Given the improved bargaining position afforded by a combination of scarcity and concentration, such owners have remained focused primarily on longer-term charters that would bridge the period from now until the next wave of LNG volumes arrives in 2026-2027. A newbuild vessel ordered today would be subject to an approximately 4-year lead time and a purchase price exceeding $260 million, limiting the likelihood of unforeseen newbuild tonnage during that period while further supporting the benchmark against which the overall fleet is priced.

The commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial TFDE LNG carriers, The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited ("Golar") was completed in a phased process. On January 26, 2022, CoolCo entered into various agreements (the "Vessel SPA") with Golar, as amended on February 25, 2022, pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities were each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal, Ice, Bear, Frost, Glacier, Snow, Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo, for three and six month periods ended June 30, 2022, the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27, 2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results, as the successor, from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities.

 
(2)

 
Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the staggered acquisition date per legal entity during the period beginning from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022.

APPENDIX A - NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND DEFINITIONS
Non-GAAP Financial Metrics Arising from How Management Monitors the Business
 
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies, and may not be comparable with similar titles, measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

 
Non-GAAP measure
 
Closest equivalent US GAAP measure

Rationale for adjustments
 
Performance Measures
 
Adjusted EBITDA
 
Net income

 
+/- Other non-operating income

 
+/- Net financial expense, representing: Interest income, Interest expense, Losses on derivative instruments and Other financial items, net

 
+/- Income taxes

 
+ Depreciation and amortization

 
- Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements, net

 
Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements, net, financing and tax items.

 
Average daily TCE
 
Time and voyage charter revenues

 
- Voyage, charter hire and commission expenses, net

 
 

 
The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days.

 
- Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel.

 
 

 
- Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel’s net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods.

 
 

 
- Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance.

 
Liquidity measures
 
Total Contractual Debt
 
Total debt (current and non-current), net of deferred finance charges

 
+ VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition

 
+ Deferred Finance Charges

 
 

 
We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation, our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs’ debt.

 
 

 
Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs.

 
 

 
The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations.

 
Total Company Cash
 
CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures:

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
+ Cash and cash equivalents

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
+ Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current)

 
- VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current)

 
We consolidate lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation, we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs.

 
 

 
Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs.

 
 

 
Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.

The commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial TFDE LNG carriers, The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited ("Golar") was completed in a phased process. On January 26, 2022, CoolCo entered into various agreements (the "Vessel SPA") with Golar, as amended on February 25, 2022, pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities are each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal, Ice, Bear, Frost, Glacier, Snow, Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo, for three and six month periods ended June 30, 2022, the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27, 2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results, as the successor, from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities.

Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the staggered acquisition date per legal entity during the period beginning from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022.

Revenue Backlog
 
Revenue backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term. Revenue backlog is not intended to represent adjusted EBITDA or future cashflows that will be generated from these contracts. This measure should be seen as a supplement to and not a substitute for our US GAAP measures of performance.
