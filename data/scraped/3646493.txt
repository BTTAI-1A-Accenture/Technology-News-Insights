Trojan's maintenance-free AES Battery maximizes longevity and reduces the total cost of ownership compared to standard AGM technology. It also works in a partial state of charge without damage. SANTA FE SPRINGS, Calif. (PRWEB) January 30, 2023   Trojan Battery Company introduces the new Trojan AES Battery for floor-cleaning machines, aerial work platforms, material handling equipment, golf vehicles and other applications at Booth 1481 of the 2023 ARA Rental Show.  The rugged premium VRLA battery delivers consistent, unrivaled high output and up to twice the cycle life of standard AGM, especially in extreme deep-cycle, partial charging, or challenging environments.  "Trojan's AES Battery lets rental houses, floor-cleaning professionals, and facilities maintenance and warehouse managers maximize productivity and slash their total cost of ownership," says Matt Herr, senior product manager for Motive. "And it enables OEMs and Master Distributors to improve and differentiate their products, boost profits, and enjoy supply-chain security thanks to our global manufacturing sites."    The Trojan AES battery outperforms competitive products in these areas:
   Harsh Conditions: Robust performance in extreme conditions and harsh temperatures.   Harmless Partial State of Charging: Tested to withstand long- term partial state of charging, without harm.  Advanced Carbon Technology Extends Life and Streamlines Operations Some traditional AGM batteries must be fully recharged after each cycle to prevent corrosion, sulfation, and early failure. Yet this is often neglected on busy work sites.   Trojan's AES Battery is engineered with a proprietary carbon additive and DCS technology to work in a partial state of charge while preserving both the negative active material and the positive material.
