Wheels keep on turning on Capital Boulevard in Raleigh, where the pace of growth in the City of Oaks is evident. Now there is a new way to roll. Conlon Family Skatepark (CFS) opened last week along one of the city's busiest roads.The park has been in the works for about a year and is the brainchild of many community leaders, organizations and those young-at-heart looking to give skaters a place to catch some air.The park, for which Affordable Communities Group CEO and founder Mike Conlon provided a significant chunk of funding, is downtown Raleigh's first skate park.In an urban setting, the park is a place where local skaters, rollerbladers and BMX riders can congregate. The site is an old maintenance facility for the city of Raleigh and the product of a collaboration between Raleigh Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Resources Department and Skate Raleigh.Jed Byrne photoRaleigh can own action sportsThe group started socializing the idea in summer 2022 and fundraising started in September.Instead of skating around discarded industrial sites or abandoned properties, the park gives skaters in Raleigh a new option that carries the visibility of being along a main road, front and center for action sports enthusiasts.Stephen Mangano has been part of several nonprofits and community projects since moving from the New York City area. His 17-year-old son, Adrian, is a skateboarder and together the two have seen skate parks around the country. Adrian had the idea to build one in Raleigh and got help from dad and dad's associates in John Cerqueira and Cody Charland."My motivation is really for Raleigh," Mangano said. "I'm fond of saying that we're probably not going to have a professional football team, but we can really own action sports. Skate Raleigh's vision is to create this in such a visible space."The park has rails, half-pipes and ramps. There are plans to build a rollerskating rink and add BMX features.There's plenty of open space, and Mangano said special events could come in the fall after the park gets equipped for electricity. The park's organizers are also asking artists to submit work for an art installation that will be displayed in the park."We call it a skatepark but it's really kind of a plaza-style," Mangano said. "Something that is accessible to all and really can engage the community as a whole. The idea was really to make it inclusive and make it accessible."The ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Thursday and those in attendance had good feedback."The skaters that came out loved the design, loved the flow," Mangano said. "Of course, you're not going to make everyone happy. People are going to want it bigger and all the other aspects of it, but we're pretty excited for what we got."Skateboarders break in the newly-built Conlon Family Skatepark in Raleigh.
