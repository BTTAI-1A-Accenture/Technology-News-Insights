 OnPay is a straightforward, all-in-one payroll and HR solution for small businesses. It comes with just one competitive price—$40 plus $6 per employee per month—that includes all services. It offers payroll tools for W-2 and 1099 workers and automatic tax payments and filing (with an error-free guarantee) and more. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, shared her thoughts on OnPay: “Any system that combines functions is always a win for a small business. In addition, OnPay is affordable and doesn’t require being locked into a long-term contract, making this system an adaptable and cost-effective choice.” There are plan tiers with OnPay—you pay one base monthly rate and then a flat fee per person per month. The base rate is $40 per month, and then you pay $6 per person per month, so, for a company with 100 employees, OnPay would cost $640 per month. As you lose or gain employees, the price adjusts to reflect the new user number. OnPay has an average rating of 4.8 from nearly 300 user reviews on G2. On Capterra, users give it an average score of 4.9 from over 400 reviews. Common themes in positive reviews include ease of use and satisfaction with customer service. In my experience, some parts of OnPay were easy to use while others were not. Customizing the dashboard and viewing employee benefits was easy, while payroll and onboarding posed some challenges. I discuss my specific obstacles with payroll in the next section. I was impressed with OnPay’s customer service, particularly over the phone. While it took longer to hear back through the chat function, I was able to reach someone in just a few minutes over the phone. The OnPay representative provided a clear answer to my question and asked if I needed anything else. I felt like the company was genuinely interested in helping me rather than selling anything. To conduct my test-drive of OnPay’s platform, I used the Google Chrome browser on a Windows laptop and an Android mobile device. OnPay’s interface is clean and straightforward, making it easy to navigate. After logging in, I landed at the user dashboard that includes at-a-glance information, such as team members, upcoming payroll runs, recent runs and whatever other tiles I chose to have displayed on my main dashboard. Both the main dashboard and the HR dashboard were easy to customize. Payroll information is front and center on your dashboard when you log in to your account. I like the easy, three-step process to run payroll but found it difficult to get around the warnings. Also, time off data doesn’t necessarily sync with payroll or an employee’s time off information in their profile. Here’s what I mean: When you’re ready to process payroll, you simply click “Start Run.” The system takes you to a screen to review all paychecks to submit. Little orange icons indicate something that needs your attention. However, I found it difficult to figure out how to resolve these warnings. For instance, one employee needed vacation time approved. However, the system showed it had already been approved. Seeing this conflicting information was confusing. When I asked a customer service representative about this, they said that this simply shows that the vacation time is already included in the payroll run. Yet, at other times, when clicking on the time-off icon next to an employee’s name, the system would show “Approve & Include.” Then it was easy to click that button and get rid of the warning. In addition, sometimes you have to choose whom to include in the payroll run. For example, when running biweekly payroll, not all employees were selected, so you have to be sure to check that all the right people are included for each payroll run. Or, you can click on the “select all” checkbox to include everyone. Once payroll is submitted, you receive an email confirmation to confirm a completed payroll run. OnPay caters to small businesses that need a full-featured payroll and HR solution with a straightforward and affordable pricing structure. Learn more: Read the full OnPay review.

 Gusto is designed with dynamic startups and small businesses in mind, and it specifically targets the solutions these types of companies need that weren’t previously available on other platforms, such as payroll on AutoPilot, contractor payments, automated employee time tracking and the versatile Gusto Wallet app. The platform provides automated, full-service through its AutoPilot payroll software for both employees and contractors—and even offers a low-cost contractor-only plan. It facilitates employee benefits including health care, employee financial wellness, retirement plans and more. Gusto includes features that might appeal particularly to modern startup workers, including automated charitable donations. Plus Gusto’s Wallet app gives employees greater control of and access to their money. Key features you can expect with Gusto include its automated payroll and tax filing for employees and contractors; the Gusto Wallet app for employees and employee time tracking tools for remote, on-premises and field employees. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, also noted how easy Gusto is to use: “Gusto makes it easy to pay all of your people, whether they are employees or contractors. New joiners receive an invitation to set themselves up in the system and once that is done and verified, you are able to set your payroll and forget it. Busy solopreneurs can find real value in using a system like this.” Gusto offers three plans for companies looking to manage payroll for both full-time employees and contractors. Gusto enjoys favorable user reviews. It boasts a score of 4.5 from 1,900 reviews on G2 and a score of 4.7 from over 3,800 reviews on Capterra. Users mostly mention Gusto’s easy-to-use interface, which we can attest to, given our hands-on experience with its payroll process and its excellent customer service. I tested Gusto’s Simple plan features using the Google Chrome browser on a Windows laptop and the Gusto Wallet app on an Android mobile device. Our ability to test the features was limited, as they required entering real bank account information and signing into external accounts. I found the process of setting up a payroll schedule pretty easy. You simply choose a schedule—Gusto automatically suggests one for you—and confirm state tax details based on where employees are located. When running payroll manually, Gusto takes you through three steps. First, you check hours and earnings for all employees. The next step prompts you to enter any paid time off that employees took during the pay period. This is also where you can approve or deny pending time-off requests. From there, Gusto lets you preview the payroll run in the third step before submitting payroll. Upon submitting, Gusto confirms that you’ve successfully submitted payroll. For contractor payments, whether domestic or international, the pay rates and pay amounts don’t automatically populate as they do with W-2 workers, so it’s a bit more time-consuming, as you have to enter this information manually. Otherwise, it’s quite simple. Just click “submit,” and that’s it. It was easy to manually add an employee or independent contractor by entering their name, email address and other crucial information. The platform offers a checkbox option to invite the added employee or contractor to fill out the rest of the information themselves. Though this process was straightforward, manually entering several people could get tedious for companies with high hiring volumes. Based on what I was able to play with in the platform, Gusto guides you through payroll and benefits management in a way that makes these processes less overwhelming. You can be sure you’re completing tasks in the right order without missing a step. However, I noticed that payroll and adding new team members, in particular, require a lot of manual data entry upfront. In addition, customization of reporting, templates and the dashboard is limited. Who Should Use It? Gusto is made for startups and growing small businesses with a mix of employee- and contractor-based workforces. It is best for businesses that expect to eventually expand across state lines or even globally using a workforce with a mix of contractors and employees. Learn more: Read the full Gusto review.

 Justworks is a professional employer organization (PEO) that appeals to remote teams. The company engages client companies in a co-employment relationship, serving as an employer of record for your employees. The co-employment relationship also means Justworks takes on some legal employer liabilities so you don’t have to, which isn’t the case for software-based payroll services. In exchange, you hand over control of some key employer processes, such as workers compensation. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, an HR professional with over 20 years of experience, adds: “Justworks is great for helping small businesses offer benefits to its employees, something most small businesses are not able to do easily or inexpensively, which is a great attraction and retention tool.” Justworks’ standout feature is its professional employer organization (PEO) services, allowing businesses to outsource some HR and payroll tasks. Here is a closer look at this service. Professional Employer Organization Services Justworks is a professional employer organization designed for remote teams. The company engages user companies in a co-employment relationship so it can handle HR and payroll on your behalf. For example, it will handle the following payroll processes and tasks for you: Justworks offers two PEO plans, plus a couple of add-ons to expand your chosen plan’s functionality. Here are your choices. Basic This plan is $59 per employee per month and offers: Plus This plan is $99 per employee per month and includes: Add-Ons Justworks offers two add-ons that can be used alongside both the Basic and Plus plans: At a starting PEO service price of $59 per employee per month, its monthly per-employee fee looks high at first glance, but it could be well below the cost of an HR hire and goes lower the more employees you have. Justworks earns 4.6 out of five stars on G2 from 458 user reviews. In addition, it earns 4.6 stars from 718 user reviews on Capterra. Users say the service is easy to set up and use for both employers and employees and is easily scalable as a company grows. They do wish that Justworks offered more in the way of integrations with popular accounting and other software and some express the need for more customizable platform features. PEOs like Justworks are a good fit for small businesses with complex hiring and potential business liability—for example, if you hire international employees or have a lot of turnover. It is also great for small businesses without in-house payroll or HR departments. Learn more: Read the full Justworks review.

 Paychex is a payroll and HR service provider for businesses of all sizes. Paychex Flex is its simplified payroll platform designed for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The platform offers an easy-to-use basic payroll processing platform to pay employees and contractors, but no HR and benefits administration in its basic Essentials plan. You must upgrade for these complementary features. It strips away the complex features of the broader Paychex platform to stand out as a provider of easy employee payroll. However, Paychex Flex does integrate with other Paychex products and offers higher-tiered plans to meet your payroll and HR needs, as well as with third-party accounting systems to automatically keep your bookkeeping updated with payroll data. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, also likes Paychex Flex: “Paychex Flex is another great option for small startups that intend to grow over time. The system is customizable with lots of robust features.” Paychex Flex offers bare-bones features to help you manage your payroll runs, such as automated tax filings, payments and calculations; a self-service mobile app for employees; and customizable payroll reporting. Paychex Flex starts at $39 per month plus $5 per employee per month. It offers three plans, including its Essentials, Select and Pro plans. However, its Select and Pro plans require a custom quote for pricing details. Here is an overview of the features each plan offers: Essentials The Essentials plan starts at $39 per month plus $5 per employee. It services businesses with up to 19 employees and offers: Select The Select plan requires a custom quote to learn pricing details. It offers all the features included in the Essentials plan, plus: Pro The Pro plan also requires a custom quote to learn about pricing. It is a full-service payroll and HR plan that offers all the features included in the Select plan, plus: Add-On Options For an additional cost, you can further customize plans with add-ons. Available add-ons with features not already included in any of the plans include: Paychex Flex earns a 4.2 out of five stars on G2 with 1,485 user reviews and a 4.1 out of five stars on Capterra with 1,547 user reviews. Users say the platform is easy to use both on the employer and employee end. They also praise Paychex Flex’s customer support for being responsive, patient, supportive and knowledgeable. However, they say that they sometimes experience frustrating glitches within the system, such as being locked out of their accounts, updates during which users cannot access their accounts and the inability to access some features. In my testing, I found that Paychex Flex offers a clean interface. Interface designers clearly worked hard to ensure that data is not overwhelming but is at your fingertips at all times in intuitive-to-find locations. For example, you will find a company directory on the upper right-hand corner of the software that includes a list of all employees. Simply click on a name to see all of their payroll information, such as their gross and net pay, deductions, pay period and preferred payment method. Detailed analytics are also offered in color-coded pie and bar charts for a straightforward interpretation of data. When I clicked on an element of the pie chart, a screen popped up to show more granular data regarding the broader data point represented in the graph. The employee app offers a robust self-serve interface that is efficient and not overwhelming. The initial dashboard offers key summary information and links, such as time-off and sick-day calculations, paycheck stub links, a task list and a time tracker. Employees can then use a left-hand menu to find more detailed information, such as their health benefits options and performance reviews. Simple forms and digital signing tools allow employees to complete documents and reviews in a fully digital format, even on a small screen. Paychex Flex is made specifically for small businesses that need a quick and simple payroll system. It’s stripped down for businesses that just need easy payroll, with flexibility to add on services as you grow. Learn more: Read the full Paychex Flex review.

 ADP is the largest and one of the most trusted payroll providers in the world. RUN is its small business solution and a good place to start if you’re a small business expecting to grow into a large enterprise. ADP RUN is a simple payroll and benefits administration platform with room to grow into enterprise plans with the main ADP platform. Its standout feature is its tax compliance support. RUN by ADP automatically calculates, deposits and files all taxes for you. It also sends W-2 and 1099 forms to your respective workers each year. It even keeps track of payroll law changes by state and adjusts your withholdings and payments accordingly to ensure you are in compliance. And, if the IRS has any questions and sends you an inquiry, RUN by ADP will handle this communication on your behalf. In addition, ADP RUN offers all the features you’d expect in a payroll service. It has tiered plans with payroll by direct deposit, a self-service employee platform, new hire onboarding and optional benefits administration for additional fees. More advanced plans include a robust HR platform, including an employee handbook, document management, training programs and employee toolkits. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, added her thoughts on ADP RUN: “ADP has been around for a long time and is a well-known name in payroll and a favorite for many financial folks because of their robust reporting features.” RUN by ADP offers advanced features for automated payroll processing, tax payments and filing and time tracking. Here is a closer look at each of these key features. RUN by ADP has four small business plans for up to 49 employees. The most basic plan offers payroll tools, while subsequent plans offer more in-depth HR tools. All plans require a custom quote to learn about pricing details. You can do so by clicking “get pricing” on the RUN by ADP pricing page and filling out the questionnaire as prompted. Essentials Payroll The Essentials Payroll plan is the most basic plan RUN by ADP offers and it is for companies that need basic payroll tools. It includes the following payroll features, plus some basic HR features: Enhanced Payroll The Enhanced RUN by ADP plan offers more HR features, such as access to ZipRecruiter for hiring. In terms of payroll-specific tools, it includes everything in the Essentials Payroll plan, plus: Complete Payroll and HR Plus This plan adds more HR features while offering all the payroll tools of the first two plans. Added HR features include: HR Pro Payroll and HR This plan offers a comprehensive toolkit of HR and payroll features. In addition to the tools offered in all other plans, it adds: RUN by ADP has a 4.5 rating on Capterra and G2 with a total of 2,075 user reviews. Users love that the software has lots of self-service and automation features to save companies time and money. However, customer service is often unresponsive and they wish the time keeping app were included in RUN by ADP’s plans. I accessed the guided demo to learn more about this product. The dashboard felt cluttered when I landed, but it did offer many tools that I needed at my fingertips. By clicking “run payroll” from the dashboard, I completed a payroll run in just a few clicks. On the “payroll” page, I viewed a spreadsheet of payments earned by employees. I could then fill in any missing data as needed. From there, I clicked “next” and was taken to a page that flagged all issues that may hinder a successful payroll run. I could click “resolve exceptions” to work out these issues before running payroll. From this screen, I was also given the option to import time tracking data from ADP’s time and attendance add-on or another time keeping software. When I clicked “next,” I accessed an overview of payroll as it currently stood, including who would be paid, when, and how much they’d be paid broken down into gross pay, taxes, deductions, net pay and employer taxes. From there, I clicked “approve” to run payroll. A confirmation page prompted me to approve the run once again. Once payroll was run, the software summarized how much was paid out and when. I was also asked if I wanted a reminder of when payroll should be run again. Overall, this process was self-explanatory and required no learning curve. Adding employees to the system was an easy process. I simply clicked “add employee” from the header menu. From there, I could either send the employee an invite to input their own information (which I could then review for accuracy and approve) or manually enter the data myself. I found the invite option to be more labor-intensive than I would like; I still had to enter the employee’s full name, Social Security number (twice to confirm accuracy), phone number, date of birth, hire date and more. It would have been far easier to just input a name and have an email be sent to the employee to do all of this work, leaving me to only approve its accuracy. Overall, though the interface is cluttered, everything I needed was easy to find. Nothing I experienced was particularly confusing, but some tasks were a bit more labor-intensive than I preferred. ADP RUN is a good choice for businesses that need highly supported payroll tax compliance features in payroll software. It’s designed for companies with fewer than 50 employees, but is a good fit if you expect to grow beyond that because you could upgrade to ADP Workforce now or ADP’s enterprise platform.

 TriNet is a professional employer organization (PEO) offering the option of payroll and HR outsourcing. Your company leases employees to TriNet—TriNet becomes an employer of record—and it takes care of HR and payroll for you. It also offers plenty of features that help you understand and control your payroll costs. They include: TriNet’s standout features include automated tax and filing support, unlimited payroll runs, a mobile app and time and attendance tracking. Here is a look at each of them. Automated Taxes and Filing TriNet can handle all payroll tax administration for you, offering the option to outsource your payroll function to its PEO service. When you do, its team of HR experts not only manage your payroll and tax administration for you but is available to your company for consulting and problem resolution. When you hire a new employee, its team of tax experts notifies the correct state entity as required by law. The platform also calculates, withholds and remits payments, then files your taxes on the federal, state and local level. Then, it prepares and delivers W-2 forms to your employees when needed. Finally, for employees, it will manage your unemployment taxes and claims on your behalf. For managing contract employees, the platform auto-generates Form 1099 when needed and grants contractors self-serve access to key tax documents. It also allows you to customize how you pay contracts with multiple pay options. TriNet helps small businesses save money by looking for tax credits for each company. For example, it allows you to input tax credit information into the payroll system and then prepares forms 8974 and 941 for you to claim those credits. Unlimited Payroll Runs Offered as an add-on in HR plans, TriNet’s payroll processing system has advanced payroll management features. They include: Through TriNet’s PEO, you can outsource all of your HR and payroll functions or you can choose which functions you want to outsource and which you’d like to keep in-house. Mobile App The TriNet mobile app offers convenient features for both employers and their employees. Employers and permissioned personnel can view employee profiles, hire and termination data, benefits and payroll information and access reporting. They can also search a knowledge base for answers to their questions or open a support case or live chat session to access TriNet customer support. Employees access the mobile app to view their paychecks, review and manage their benefits and access their tax documents. In addition, they can track their vacation days and request time off using the mobile app. Finally, as an added perk, employees can use the app to access TriNet-offered discounts on technology, groceries and other products. Time and Attendance Tracking TriNet’s time and attendance tracking tools provide companies with the ability to meticulously monitor worked hours, allowing them to effectively control payroll expenses. These savings may take the form of minimizing excessive costs, such as unapproved overtime, or avoiding compliance penalties. To this end, with TriNet time and attendance tools, you can: TriNet offers three plans ranging from $8 per employee per month to $33 per user per month when billed monthly. However, unlike many competitors on this list, only the most expensive plan offers payroll features. To access payroll features in the first two tiers, you have to first purchase the core plan and then pay $6 per employee per month more to access the payroll add-on. When I contacted customer support, I was told that this payroll add-on is typically only sold as an add-on and not as a standalone product. Essentials The Essentials plan is a basic HR platform costing $10 per employee per month when paid monthly and $8 per employee per month when billed annually. It includes: Growth TriNet’s Growth plan is $20 per employee per month when billed monthly and $16 per employee per month when billed annually. This plan offers tools for ensuring you are paying your employees fairly without overpaying them, allowing you to save costs while attracting top talent. It includes everything in the Essentials plan, plus: Zen The Zen plan is $33 per user per month when billed monthly and $27 per user per month when billed annually. While the Essentials and Growth plans require you to pay more to access the payroll add-on, this plan includes TriNet’s payroll processing system. Here is an overview of the inclusions in this plan: Add-Ons While the above plans are TriNet’s core small business plans, it offers add-on options as a way to customize the plans to your needs. Its add-on options include: Dylan Cleppe, co-founder and CEO of OneStop Northwest LLC, uses TriNet’s benefits administration for his business: “One aspect of TriNet that I found particularly beneficial is its comprehensive approach to benefits management. For a small business like mine, being able to offer competitive benefits is crucial for attracting and retaining top talent. TriNet provides a streamlined platform where I can manage payroll, HR tasks and employee benefits all in one place, which not only saves time but also reduces the potential for errors.” TriNet has a 3.8 and 4.0 star review on Capterra and G2 respectively, with 649 user reviews total. Users say the software is extremely easy to use and has comprehensive features. They also say TriNet’s customer support is responsive (responding within just minutes of inquiry submission) and knowledgeable. However, they do not like that the platform experiences frequent reporting glitches and they wish it offered more integration options. PEOs like TriNet are a good fit for small businesses with complex hiring and potential business liability—for example, if you hire international employees or have a lot of turnover. It is also a great option for companies that need tools to pay employees fairly while keeping payroll costs to a minimum. Learn more: Read the full TriNet review.

 Toronto-based Wave is a relatively new player in small business financial services, and it’s making its name by building a user-friendly and affordable platform that addresses the unique needs of freelancers, contractors and small business owners. Payroll is Wave’s latest feature. It comes to the platform along with accounting, invoicing and payment processing for small businesses—replacing a laundry list of tools for many entrepreneurs. Through Wave Payroll, you can pay employees and contractors via direct deposit and automatically generate W-2 and 1099 forms for tax season. It takes care of payroll tax payment and filing in 14 states (and growing), and offers a self-service employee portal for easy access to tax documents and banking and contact updates. In addition, if you own a seasonal business and only need payroll software during parts of the year, you can deactivate your subscription for off-seasons and avoid paying Wave during that time. Then, when your business season kicks back in, simply reactivate your subscription and account. This capability, coupled with its contract payment options, makes Wave an ideal option for seasonal businesses such as garden centers and landscaping companies. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, appreciates that you can use the system with its accounting software: “Wave’s payroll system integrates with its free accounting system, making it a good choice for businesses that handle all of their finance processes internally.” Wave doesn’t offer benefits administration, a major drawback, but its recent purchases of companies across the financial sector and its 2019 acquisition by H&R Block promise more capabilities and features to come. Wave Payroll’s standout features include employee and contractor payroll tools, tax services, an employee self-service portal and invoicing tools. Here is a closer look at each of them. Wave offers two plans based on the state in which you operate your business. If you operate in one of the 14 states in which Wave offers tax services, you will pay a higher base monthly rate to take advantage of these services. All other states must remit payment and file their taxes themselves and so will pay a lower monthly base rate for Wave’s payroll solution. Both plans come with a 30-day free trial. Tax Service States Most businesses using Wave Payroll will need to pay a $20 monthly base fee, plus $6 per active employee or contractor paid per month to use Wave’s payroll solution. This is because Wave does not offer tax payment and filing services in 37 U.S. states (see next plan for states that are excluded from this plan.). Payroll tools offered in this plan include: Self-Serve States In addition to all the features in the Tax Service plan, Wave offers automated payroll tax services in 14 U.S. states. If your business operates in any of these states, you must choose this plan. The Self-Serve States plan costs $40 per month plus $6 per contractor paid and active employee. It offers automatic calculations, remittance and filing of payroll taxes. The states in which this plan applies are: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. Wave Payroll earns four out of five stars on Capterra with 61 reviews and 4.1 out of five stars on G2 with 31 user ratings. Users like that the software is extremely easy to use and set up, is affordable and has free features such as invoicing. However, they say that the software does not offer enough customization options, nor does it offer detailed reporting to meet their needs. They also say its customer support is unhelpful; the chat bot does not offer relevant solutions and when they email customer support, it often doesn’t, either. They say the limited features the platform offers makes it a good option for companies with five to 10 employees but no more. I tested Wave Payroll on a Mac computer and a Safari browser. Signing up for the free trial was simple, taking only a couple of minutes. I simply had to input my name, email address and phone number. I was sent a code to my phone to verify my identity. After inputting the code, I was asked simple questions about how I wanted to use the account, such as if I wanted to invoice clients or run payroll. Once set up, the account brought me to an initial reporting dashboard. The dashboard had a handful of reports and optional action items but didn’t feel cluttered or overwhelming. Reports I could access right away included a cash flow analysis for my business, a list of outstanding invoices, bills my company owes, an income and expense statement by fiscal year and an expense breakdown pie chart with percentages for each expense category. Adding an employee could not have been simpler in my case, though there was more manual data entry than I preferred. I clicked “add an employee” from the initial dashboard and was taken to a form to fill in information on my employee. Information I had to enter included the employee’s full name and Social Security number, their home address, a work location, the type of wage they would receive (salary or hourly, for example), their email address and how I wanted to pay them (direct deposit, for example). Since I was given the option to send them an invite to input their own information, I would have preferred to only input about half of this data before sending the invite. However, I only had to click a box and click “submit” to send an invite to my employee. Still, the process did not require any technical knowledge and each step was intuitive to complete. Some features I wish were better include its automation options, customization options and chat support. There are almost no automation options and you cannot customize the dashboard at all. Reporting also did not offer customization options. In addition, when I contacted the chat support to ask if I had missed any customization options, I was given irrelevant responses and prompted to contact customer support via email. All in all, the chat support feature was unhelpful. In addition, when trying to access tax services, I was simply upsold by a partner company that wanted $500 plus $150 to do my taxes. In other screens, I was prompted to buy more products from Wave Payroll. I would have preferred to be contacted some other way to be asked to buy more products from Wave or its partners. Wave is a unique fit for microbusinesses and solopreneurs who pay a small team heavy in contractors and part-timers, and frequently invoice clients or customers for online payment. And, with the ability to pause the subscription, it is great for service companies such as landscapers who hire contractors often and endure off-seasons.

 Paycor is a full-service HR platform that supports companies from recruiting to termination. It offers an employee portal online and through the Paycor mobile app, so employees can access pay stubs, documents, time-off requests, performance evaluations and employee development all from their phones. You can add on benefits administration for an extra fee and let employees manage and enroll in benefits through the self-service portal, as well. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, also likes the full-service aspect of Paycor: “Growing companies can find value in the full suite of HR tools in addition to payroll processing.” Key Paycor features include its payroll processing tools, tax compliance services, mobile wallet (complete with a self-serve mobile portal) and expense tracking and reimbursement tools. Here is a closer look at each. Paycor offers four payroll plans, including its Basic, Essential, Core and Complete plans. Pricing for them is not publicly available. You must request a quote to get pricing details. However, you can expect a 50% discount for the first six months of your chosen plan subscription as part of Paycor’s current promotion. Here is a look at the features offered in each plan: Basic The Basic plan offers features you need to pay employees and manage tax compliance. Its payroll processing features include: Essential Paycor’s Essential plan offers new hire productivity tools in addition to payroll and tax compliance features, such as: Core The Core plan offers all the features in the Basic and Essential plans, plus: Complete Finally, Paycor’s most feature-rich plan is its Complete plan. It offers the features of the first three tiers plus the following tools: Paycor has a 4.4 rating on Capterra with over 2,700 reviews. However, it only has a 3.9 rating on G2 with five user reviews. Users say the software’s customer support representatives are friendly but sometimes slow to respond. They also say the software is pricey compared to other payroll software options. However, they like that the platform is easy to use, offers guided setup and training and all the basic features most businesses need to manage their payroll and HR needs. I tested Paycor using a Mac laptop computer. Paycor offers a testing account with sandbox data, and I found the system interface to be clean and intuitive to navigate. All features are clearly listed in the right-hand menu. Reviewing and managing payroll was a familiar process because of its intuitive grid or spreadsheet-like layout. For those who have managed payroll through Excel or Google Sheets, this system will make sense to you. I could process payroll in two clicks. To change pay rates or correct time worked, I only had to click on a cell to input the new data point. Filters along the top of the spreadsheet allowed me to easily add or remove columns of information I needed, such as bonuses, holidays, paid time off, overtime premium and overtime hours. Once I’ve reviewed the pay run, I simply had to click “approve payroll” to run my payroll for that pay period. The reporting feature is robust and customizable. Paycor offers a report builder tool that allows you to select a report you want to run, then customize it by selecting available options. For example, you can choose from a selection of onboarding, time, payroll, HR or security reports. Once I chose my report, it offered a list of columns I could include or exclude. I simply had to check the corresponding boxes to add or remove columns, such as: I could also use filters to group data by department or pay type, for example. The home also had a familiar newsletter-like layout. It offered easy customizations by allowing me to add or remove modules. For example, when I signed into my account, I clicked “customize homepage” from the top menu and was presented with a list of available modules. From there, I clicked the corresponding X or “activate” link next to a module to add or remove it from my homepage. I could choose from the following modules to include: Overall, in my experience, Paycor’s user experience required no learning curve. Task workflows were self-explanatory and required minimal effort on my part. However, the system seemed a bit glitchy. It kept signing me out and requiring me to sign back in in the middle of tasks. This was a minimal disturbance but still a disturbance that cost me time and effort to handle. Paycor offers plans for businesses of all sizes, but the software is best for medium and large businesses with more complex HR needs than smaller companies. Learn more: Read the full Paycor review.

 Rippling offers all the tools you’d expect in a small business payroll software, including automated payroll, tax filing support, direct deposit payments and reporting. And, notably, it makes running and managing payroll extra intuitive by offering automations that ripple across the system so all parts of the software, from its IT and Financial Cloud to its HR and payroll features, are always in sync. Lisa Lindsey, PHR, SHRM-CP, our advisory board member, sees a lot of value in Rippling: ”Rippling is an exciting product for startups where a single person is often performing the HR, finance and IT functions.  These functions are intertwined, and the simplicity of a single system to manage the overlapping tasks is heaven-sent.” Rippling stands out with its automated payroll tools. True to its name, one change in the payroll system creates an automated ripple effect, updating all aspects of payroll that are impacted. For example, if an employee moves to begin a new role after being promoted, the hiring manager may change that employee’s compensation. This change initiates changes in tax withholdings, tax filings, payroll calculations, healthcare deductions and more, all without the manager having to lift a finger. Here are some standout features included in Rippling’s automated payroll features: To access Rippling payroll, you must subscribe to two of the Rippling modules, including its Unity and HR modules. The Unity module is responsible for uniting any other modules you select into the core Rippling platform, including its IT Cloud, Finance Cloud and HR Cloud. Specifically, its HR Cloud offers domestic and global payroll services. In the end, this means you must pay for two modules for each employee to get started with Rippling payroll tools, including its: Rippling earns a 4.8 star rating on G2 with 2,2802,800 user reviews and a 4.9 rating on Capterra with more than 3,000 user reviews. Its users praise the platform for its user-friendliness and clean user interface. They say the Rippling customer support is overall responsive and helpful and they haven’t experienced an overly steep learning curve with the platform. Any time they have a question, they rarely have to reach out for live support because Rippling’s troubleshooting articles help them easily resolve the issue themselves. However, they report that there are a lot of features to consider when setting up the platform. Adding helpful features such as the IT or workflow modules can get pricey. In addition, there may be a lot of features small businesses may not need. In my experience, setting up automations was as intuitive as possible, given the large ripple effect each automation produces. I had to first set up people groups within the platform, including their permission levels and other specifications. Once I did so, it was easy to add people to those groups with just a few clicks and trust the system to update their access levels, applicable policies, tax filing workflows, hierarchical protocols, communication channels and devices. Running payroll happens using a simple spreadsheet interface. I could change payment details, approve payments and run payroll right from the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet automatically calculates all related expenses, including: Any systems that must sync to derive this data, such as time clock software or systems, happen automatically, so I didn’t have to worry about any of those processes. Rippling is best for small businesses that hire talent internationally and need an automated way to handle payroll runs, compliance and tax filings across the globe. It is also best for growing businesses that need automation tools to scale their payroll and compliance efforts as they grow. Learn more: Read the full Rippling review.

We then scored these contenders across 34 metrics in five categories weighted to favor features that small business owners find valuable in a payroll provider. Here’s a breakdown of the categories we used to rank the providers that made the top of the list.  Read More: How We Evaluate Payroll Services Payroll refers to the total compensation a company pays employees for their work. Payroll also refers to the process of calculating employees’ net pay and initiating payment to them. Whether you have one employee or 100, you’ll need to process payroll to ensure they get paid correctly and that proper records are kept. Although each has a unique design with varied features, most online payroll services work basically the same way. They typically include a cloud-based portal for both employers and employees. Employers—or your accountant, bookkeeper or HR employee—set up benefits and salaries for employees and, on some platforms, contractors. When you hire a new worker, you can invite them to self-onboard through the employee portal, so you’ll easily gather their W-4 or W-9 form and contact information, and they can sign up for relevant benefits. Some payroll services offer automated payroll, so you can set worker pay and employees can track their time (if necessary) and the service runs payroll on schedule. The services let workers enter direct deposit information, and you connect a business bank account on the employer end, so payroll runs without you having to print and deliver checks. If payroll isn’t automated, you have to run it manually on schedule a couple of days before payday, entering worker pay amounts and scheduling paydays. Many online payroll services include features that help you administer benefits in the same platform, as well as integrations for accounting software. Many offer workers the option to get a payment card, so they can receive money before payday and use the card directly to make purchases. Some payroll services are part of comprehensive HR platforms that include not only pay and benefits but also employee development, education and coaching programs. How your team uses an online payroll system will vary depending on the size of your team, the expertise of your employees and the system you use. Most services come with excellent sales and customer service reps who can help you get set up and answer questions you have along the way. A basic payroll solution helps you pay employees and, on some platforms, contractors. Use it to facilitate direct deposit as well as to manage payroll checks, taxes and reporting. Most payroll services also include benefits administration, so you can use the platform to set up paid time off, retirement plans, insurance and other benefits for employees and integrate benefits with payroll.

Ask an expert Lisa Lindsey Forbes Business Advisory Board Member Alana Rudder Staff Reviewer Rachel Williams Small Business Editor You want to ensure that you have a reliable professional preview your system implementation to ensure that your payroll is set up completely and in a way that positions you to grow effectively. Additionally, make sure you have support with processing the first few payrolls via your new system to identify and fix any errors. Forbes Business Advisory Board Member Start by pinpointing your biggest payroll challenges. For example, is your biggest challenge time? If so, choose a payroll software with automation features such as autopilot payroll runs and automated tax filing. Or, are payroll labor costs mounting up? Then, look for a software with a free version or one with enough features to replace some of your labor needs, such as a PEO that will handle your payroll management.  Staff Reviewer Look for a service that offers essential features like accurate payroll processing, tax compliance and employee self-service options. Make sure it aligns with your business’s growth plans. For example, maybe you have only a handful of employees now but want to grow in the future and will need more bells and whistles.  Small Business Editor These features make payroll tools a step up from running payroll manually with a spreadsheet. The payroll software you use should integrate with QuickBooks or whichever accounting software you use to keep an accurate record of payroll history in the event of an audit. Payroll software should also integrate with benefits administration software for accurate deductions and with time tracking software. To further evaluate your payroll needs, answer these ten questions about your business and its payroll system. Get an expert to help you manage employee payment, taxes, government compliance and other payroll-related activities. Get estimates from participating partners  “Cost is always an issue for small business but a cheap system costs more in bad press when the payroll system fails and employees go unpaid,” Stolpe says. “Remember that employees are the greatest resource and the expectation is that they will be paid timely and accurately.” Besides a fixed monthly cost, online payroll services often charge per transaction or employee payment. This implies that the larger the number of employees, the greater the transaction fee. If you are planning to expand your workforce, carefully consider how your payroll service cost will change while you are growing. Most payroll providers have a tiered payment structure to cater to businesses of different sizes. Evaluate which tier would be least expensive for you in the long run before signing up. You might need to opt for paid add-ons to ensure you have all the “must have” features in your payroll service. Be mindful of how much they cost. If you can squeeze some “good to have” features as well, do so but don’t overextend yourself. To sum up, these are some of the costs you need to look at before you make a final decision: Forbes Advisor deputy editor Lauren Holznienkemper contributed to this article.

 Payroll refers to the total compensation a company pays employees for their work. Payroll also refers to the process of calculating employees’ net pay and initiating payment to them. Whether you have one employee or 100, you’ll need to process payroll to ensure they get paid correctly and that proper records are kept. The best payroll software for your company depends on your business size and needs. Top payroll services for small businesses include OnPay, Gusto and ADP RUN. Traditional companies offer customizable plans to fit your needs while platforms tailored for startups offer straightforward pricing and all-inclusive packages you can get up and running in minutes. A payroll system should have these features: The benefits of payroll software are payroll accuracy, timeliness and compliance. Plus, due to automations, payroll software saves HR staff time. Here’s how to get your payroll started: A PEO payroll service is a co-employer that manages your employee data and other core HR activities for your company, including payroll. It’s essentially a way to outsource your payroll. It typically takes five business days between finalizing internal payroll processes and employees receiving the check in their bank account through direct deposit. It takes longer if employees receive mailed checks.
