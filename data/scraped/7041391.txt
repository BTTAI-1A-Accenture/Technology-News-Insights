 will vary on your credit history and other factors. Why trust our credit card experts Our team of experts evaluates hundreds of credit cards and analyzes thousands of data points to help you find the best card for your situation. We use a data-driven methodology to determine each rating. Advertisers do not influence our editorial content. You can read more about our methodology below. It can feel like a challenge to qualify for a traditional credit card when you’re establishing your credit history. Whether you’re rebuilding your credit or starting from scratch, the Mission Lane Visa Card is an unsecured card, which means that you don’t have to put down a security deposit to open your account. The Mission Lane Visa Card is a standout from the rest, as it offers a unique prequalification tool to assess your existing credit history, income and other factors. The secret formula, then, results in a tailored package for the applicant. For example, you may (or may not) have to pay an annual fee from $0 to $59. Depending on your credit history, Mission Lane may deem you eligible to earn 1% or 1.5% cash back on qualifying purchases — or perhaps not give you any rewards-earning potential at all. No matter the case, we’ll do a deep dive into what you should know before applying for the Mission Lane Visa Card. At this time, the Mission Lane Visa Card does not offer a welcome bonus. However, this is standard practice for cards designed to help you build your credit like the Mission Lane Visa Card.  The Mission Lane Visa Card is a cash-back card, allowing cardholders to earn either an unlimited 1% or 1.5% cash back on qualifying purchases, depending on program terms. The cash-back rate is determined once you are approved for the card. Cash back earned will automatically be applied as a statement credit. Using government data and other publicly available information, we estimate that a household in the U.S. that would be in the market for this card has an annual income of $84,352 and $25,087 in expenses they are likely to be able to charge to a credit card. As the cash-back rate will depend on the user’s eligibility to earn rewards, you may be targeted to earn either 1% or 1.5% cash back on qualifying purchases, depending on program terms with the Mission Lane Visa Card: While the Mission Lane Visa Card does not offer a 0% introductory interest rate, it offers a 19.99% to 29.99% variable APR on purchases depending on your creditworthiness. The Petal 1 Visa Card (issued by WebBank) is a comparable card that’s designed for those with less-than-ideal credit. With  no annual fee or foreign transaction fees, the Petal 1 Visa card comes with a varying credit limit of $300 to $5,000. Better yet, you can even earn 2% to 10% cash back at select merchants. Similarly, there’s no credit check required when you use Petal’s preapproval tool. Cardholders of the Petal 1 Visa Credit Card may eventually qualify for a credit limit increase by exercising great credit habits. However, the Petal 1 Visa has a very high 25.24% to 34.74% variable APR, so this is not a card to carry a balance on due to high interest charges. While the no-annual-fee Discover it® Secured Credit Card requires you to put down at least a $200 security deposit to open your account, it’s totally refundable and will determine your initial credit line. For example, if you put $1,000 down, you’ll get a credit line of $1,000, making it a much more predictable option compared to the Mission Lane Visa Card.  After seven months of paying your statement on time, you may be eligible to receive your security deposit back and get upgraded to a traditional “unsecured” card. Finally, there’s a prequalification tool to see if you’ll get approved without any impact to your credit score.  To give you an insight into rewards credit cards you may qualify for down the line, the Chase Freedom Unlimited® is an excellent example to consider. With no annual fee, this cash-back card offers valuable rewards — to the tune of 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠, 3% cash back on eligible dining and drugstore purchases and 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. New cardholders can earn 1.5% back on everything bought in the first year on up to $20,000 in spending, which is worth up to $300. However, this card requires a good to excellent credit score to qualify. Thankfully, the Chase Freedom Unlimited isn’t going anywhere — and it’ll be available to apply for once you bring up your credit score.  The Mission Lane Visa Card can be a worthwhile option for those who are looking to fix or establish their credit history and scores. By paying your full statement by its due date every month, that activity will reflect positively on your credit and potentially qualify you for credit line increases. Eventually, you’ll want to look toward other rewards credit cards once you’re able to qualify, but the Mission Lane Visa Card can be a great stepping stone to achieve your credit goals.    Methodology Our credit cards team has spent hours analyzing hundreds of credit cards.
