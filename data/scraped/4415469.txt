Ali Larter, Michelle Randolph, and Jacob Lofland are set to star alongside Billy Bob Thornton in Taylor Sheridan’s upcoming series Paramount+ series Land Man. The series is set in “the proverbial boomtowns of West Texas and is a modern-day tale of fortune-seeking in the world of oil rigs. It’s described as an “upstairs/downstairs story of roughnecks and wildcat billionaires fueling a boom so big, it’s reshaping our climate, our economy and our geopolitics.”  The show is based on the podcast Boomtown. Randolph will take on the role of Ainsley Norris, who is described as “the wild and strong-willed seventeen-year-old daughter of Tommy Norris (Thornton).” Lofland will play Cooper Norris, “Tommy’s son, who is new to the demanding work in the oil and gas fields of west Texas.” Larter will take on the role of Angela, Tommy’s ex-wife. Sheridan and Randolph recently worked together on the Yellowstone prequel series 1923. The series was co-created and executive produced by Taylor Sheridan and Christian Wallace.
