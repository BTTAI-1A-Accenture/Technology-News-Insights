 JUNCTION CITY – With a crucial week coming up, there was no looking ahead for Junction City on Thursday. Taylen Owens had 20 points to lead three players in double figures, as Junction City rolled to a 63-24 win over Rison in 8-2A play. Lamontra Hankton had 14 points and Jakourian Key added 11 points for the Dragons (14-11, 5-3), who swept the home-and-home series from the Wildcats after winning 68-30 at Rison on Tuesday. Jordan Banks and Jamarion Toles each had six points, while Jakayas Jones had five points and DeMarion Henry had one point to round out the Dragons’ scoring. Junction City has road tilts at Woodlawn and Parkers Chapel next week that will go a long way toward determining the seeding for next month’s district tournament.
