Meghan has supported Harvest Home for several years, donating time, money and resources to the charity.  On Mother's Day in 2021, she donated supplies to help 'uplift' those that the organisation supports. She said at the time, "When we consider how vulnerable any mother feels during the fragile time of pregnancy, we gain perspective about how especially difficult it can be for pregnant women of colour and those who come from under-resourced and vulnerable communities. I hope you will accept an offer of support to help further uplift Harvest Home's residents." In July of the same year, Archewell partnered with Procter & Gamble and Pampers to donate nappies to the charity.  After receiving the generous gift, Harvest Home took to Instagram to thank Meghan for her thoughtfulness. They wrote, I"These diapers recently arrived at our new Pico-Robertson Home and we could not be more thankful to Archewell Foundation, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and @proctergamble and @pampersus for the incredible donation through their Million Acts of Love Campaign.  "Thank you helping us ensure our resident and alumnae families' needs are met!"
