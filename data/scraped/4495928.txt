Intelligent CIO Europe Providing Unparalleled Technology Intelligence UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, with the support of the United Nations International Computing Centre (UNICC), has partnered with industry experts ServiceNow, British Telecom (BT) and Thirdera (formerly Silverstorm Solutions) to set up a regional contact centre (RCC) for refugees fleeing the ongoing war in Ukraine.   With its mission to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees, UNHCR reports that there were more than eight million Ukrainian refugees recorded across Europe by the end of February 2023. UNHCR works to ensure that refugees can exercise the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge in another state and to return home voluntarily when they choose and when it is safe to do so.   Bringing together the best of ServiceNow, BT, Thirdera and UNICC’s digital expertise and solutions, the new UNHCR RCC solution offers refugees a user-friendly, multilingual platform to access vital information on emergency services, assistance and psychosocial counselling services as well as identifying vulnerable refugees and referring them to specialists for follow up support. The RCC also provides information on education, employment, healthcare, housing and legal support.  The RCC platform offers a cost-effective, cloud-based solution for UNHCR’s efforts in the field. It is built around a BT solution integrated with case management from Thirdera, using ServiceNow’s Customer Service Management (CSM) application, to create and keep interaction records with callers and identify and refer vulnerabilities to UNHCR and its partners for follow-up and response.
