North East-based restaurant group Tomahawk Steakhouse only launched its Newgate Street venue - formerly occupied by Brazilian eatery Picanha by Fazenda - in September last year.  A notice in the window confirms the restaurant's closure "for the foreseeable future", ad when you contact the venue directly you're greeted with the following message: "The Chester branch is closed until further notice. Our other branches are open as normal. Apologies for any inconvenience caused."

The restaurant posted on Mother's Day, to which one customer replied on Monday: "Iâ€™ve just had my table cancelled please can I have some info? I have a voucher we wanted to use?" The chain, which has a number of venues across the country including sites in Stockton Heath, York, Newcastle and London, specialises in Himalayan salt dry-aged steaks. Speaking last year, owner Howard Eggleston said: "2022 has opened out to be a really exciting time for the expansion of the Tomahawk group and we have been inundated with potential sites all over the UK."
