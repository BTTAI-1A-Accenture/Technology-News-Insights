The Francis College of Engineering has been recognized as exemplar and with a Bronze Award for the inaugural ASEE Diversity Recognition Program. The ASEE Diversity Recognition Program (ADRP) was created to publicly recognize those engineering and engineering technology colleges that make significant, measurable progress in increasing the diversity, inclusion, and degree attainment outcomes of their programs. Kevin Twitchell graduated the first time as a criminal justice major – and then switched direction, going back to school at night to get a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering technology. Her experiences in the Honors College and in a college readiness program, Let’s Get Ready, helped Marilyn Saha get a job at Raytheon Technologies. By working with the Office of International Experiences & Study Abroad, chemical engineering major Nicholas Langberg was able to add a two-month internship to his summer school program in Germany. Shanice Kelly is a leader in multiple campus clubs because she wants to get more students of color involved in STEM, especially space science programs. Plastics Engineering alumnus Leo Montagna Jr. '70, '76 says he wouldn't be where is is today with the University. He is a devoted UMass Lowell donor and supporter of the Plastics Engineering Department. Rohann Nair was torn about whether to pursue a master of science degree or an MBA. Instead of choosing, he opted for both by enrolling in UMass Lowell’s master’s degree in engineering management. Francis College of Engineering
