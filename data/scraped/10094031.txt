Yesterday, Bitcoin surpassed its resistance level of $30,450 but has now stabilised at $29,930. In the event of further declines, BTC's next support level is around $29,400, with resistance at $30,250. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency industry is awaiting the release of the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade today, which will allow phased staking withdrawals.” WazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, “Bitcoin’s moving averages continue to indicate a ‘Buy’ sentiment as the token price crosses $30,000. The US Fed’s interest rate hike and SEC’s reassurance to investors are driving the growth of users to digital assets.” Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, “Bitcoin has rallied 3.50 percent in the past 24 hours. The market expects a 71 percent chance that the US Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting. From a technical analysis perspective, the BTC/USD pair shows a clear bullish trend at the $30,000 milestone with potential resistance at $31,000 or even $32,250 if this level is breached.” Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
