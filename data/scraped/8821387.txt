Jan 7, 2023 Schauffele withdraws due to sore back Xander Schauffele, the 2019 Sentry Tournament of Champions winner, withdrew from the event on Friday, citing a sore back.  Schauffele, the No. 6-ranked player in the world, was 2-under par for the tournament when he withdrew following the eighth hole, 1 over for his Friday round. Schauffele withdrew from Wednesday’s pro-am before playing the opening round Thursday, shooting 3-under 70. “I’ve never had any sort of issues,” Schauffele said of his back after his decision to withdraw. “It’s just not getting better. It actually feels worse when I swing. When I’m done with treatment and like a full night of sleep, treatment, full night of sleep, treatment, I actually feel pretty good, and I have more range.  “And my range is better than it was on Monday when it happened. But I’m just kind of like, I feel like I’m pogoing back and forth with myself.” _______________ Spieth, Kim among 19 headed to Waialae Nearly half of the field here for the Sentry Tournament of Champions, 19 of 39 starters, are scheduled to be at Waialae Country Club next week for the Sony Open.
