    KYOTO -- Kanji characters and symbols created with flames emerged one after another on hillsides surrounding this ancient Japanese capital on the evening of Aug. 16 in a traditional summer ritual.
 
    The traditional Gozan Okuribi event was held to send off the spirits of ancestors that are said to revisit during the Obon holiday in mid-August. The kanji character for "dai" (large) was lit on the hillside of Mount Nyoigatake to the east of the city center, as many people watched while cooling off by the Kamo River.
 
    Kyoto was hit by violent storms on Aug. 15 due to Typhoon Lan, but there was no serious damage to the trails or fire beds of the mountains. On the morning of Aug. 16, pine splints and other wood set aside for burning in Buddhist rituals were brought up and the fire-lighting event was held as usual. At around 8 p.m., the kanji character for "dai" was lit up, followed by the characters for "myoho" (meaning "mystery" or "the law of Buddha"), a depiction of a boat, another "dai" character, and a depiction of a Shinto torii gate.
