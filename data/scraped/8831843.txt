Despite positive growth in revenues, the company reported a net loss of $98 million, up from $28 million in the year-ago period. It was primarily due to a restructuring cost of $828 million and losses on strategic investments of $314 million. The company’s top line grew 18% y-o-y to $31.35 billion in FY 2023. It was mainly driven by an 18% growth in the subscription & support segment, followed by a 27% rise in the professional services & other revenues. On the cost front, the gain on strategic investments decreased from $1.2 billion to -$239 million. Further, operating expenses as a % of revenues witnessed an unfavorable increase in the year.
