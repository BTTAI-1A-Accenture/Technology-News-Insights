When it comes to finding the best headphones deals, I'm a seasoned pro, having spent the last four years keeping a close eye on them. As a tech expert, I know the finer details between features like ANC, drivers, and various driver details. I understand what LDAC is, how noise cancellation works, and how a charging case's charge time might affect performance.
                         I keep a close eye on headphones, monitoring their prices through apps like Honey and CamelCamelCamel. Additionally, I have a hard rule that the deal has to knock at least 10 percent off the original price and if it's not, it's not a great deal. I also take into account price gouging, which is when a retailer will secretly raise the list price sky-high only to "discount" it at its normal price. With all my tips and tricks to find the best headphones deals, I'm confident that you're getting the best deal on these headphones available right now.
