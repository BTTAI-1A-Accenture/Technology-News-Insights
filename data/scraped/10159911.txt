 We have had a lot going on in the last two weeks. Former Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia joined S. Somasegar on Founded & Funded recently to discuss his new book  and, of course, data and AI. Loren Alhadeff wrote about when startups should hire a CRO. We want to say another huge thank you to everyone that hosted events and attended our inaugural #SeattleTechWeek! Don't miss our recap video! Investors Vivek Ramaswami and Sabrina Wu dove into Q2 earnings to figure out who all is talking about #GenAI, and we're excited to share that Investor Maria Gilfoyle was named a Forbes 30 under 30! We also have lots of news from the portfolio, including WhyLabs, Fixie, and Runway being named to CB Insights' inaugural GenAI 50 list and Clari acquiring Groove. Founded & Funded We had the pleasure of having former Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia on Founded & Funded again. Bob is an active investor and sits on the boards of many next-generation data platform companies, and more recently, he launched his first book — “The Datapreneurs.” Given the long history between Bob and Madrona Managing Partner S. Somasegar, we had to have Bob join us again to talk about his new book and dive into the world of #data and #AI. These two old friends discuss what exactly a datapreneur is and the Arc of Data Innovation concept Bob wrote about in his book. They also talk through how companies can add value through copilots and agents and what white spaces and opportunities there are for entrepreneurs right now — especially when it comes to  models. Listen to the full episode here. Madrona News It is widely understood that revenue growth is crucial to the success of a startup. But at what point should a startup be thinking about long-term revenue growth and, in turn, hire a #ChiefRevenueOfficer? The CRO role has, of late, become a bit of a fad with very early startups, but often this doesn’t actually work out. Loren Alhadeff believes that CROs are incredibly valuable if hired at the appropriate time in a company’s growth cycle — there are three crucial stages a startup needs to go through before bringing on a #CRO: finding product-market fit, scrappy sales-enabled growth, and navigating scale. Read Loren's breakdown here: https://bit.ly/3qxkt5M More than 1,200 people assembled in the Seattle area to attend over 40 events for the inaugural Seattle Tech Week. By launching what we called the beta year, we aimed to bring together tech enthusiasts, investors, founders, and innovators at tech companies big and small from around the globe to mingle in Seattle's buzzing tech ecosystem. It quickly became clear, however, that branding it the beta was not necessary — we should have known that Seattle would want to hit the ground running just like the SF and LA Tech Weeks organized by our friends at a16z. Thank you to all the event hosts and attendees that made the week a huge success! We look forward to an even bigger event next year! Read our wrapup from the week here: https://bit.ly/3YwrXlX A huge congratulations to Madrona Investor Maria Gilfoyle — she was named to the inaugural Forbes  Local Seattle class!! Even just last month, Maria lead the charge to make the first Seattle Tech Week a success!! She's a rockstar, and this is well-deserved! Read about all the honorees here. "Madrona has been a dynamic, open-minded partner as we’ve gone through Pendulum’s startup journey. The firm has a unique depth of experience that helps us simultaneously focus on short-term execution while keeping a long-term vision for the company." — Pendulum Co-Founder Mark Listes. Mark recently reflected on the early days of the company and the founder/investor relationship in an interview with Madrona. Read the full Q&A here. Newsletters As many public companies have announced their Q2’23 earnings results over the last few weeks, Vivek Ramaswami and Sabrina Wu thought it would be interesting to understand if (and how) they are actively discussing artificial intelligence and #LLMs in their earnings calls. In other words: Is #GenerativeAI something that only Microsoft, Google, startups, and VCs are blabbering on about? They ran a search on how many times certain phrases were found in the earnings transcripts of hundreds of publicly traded companies since July 1st (the approximate beginning of Q2 earnings season). They parsed both SaaS and non-SaaS companies to get a pulse on where they see the most usage of these terms. The data tells an interesting story… Read and Subscribe to their Subtack to learn more! Can big company #leaders successfully transition to a #startup? Audra Aulabaugh thinks yes, but it requires leaders to do some deep soul-searching, 2-way validation from leaders and founders, and often some reverse interviewing.
