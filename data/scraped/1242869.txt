In 2023, War Front's yearlings sold for up to $800,000, and he is among the top 10 North American-based sires this season by percentage of black-type winners from starters (6.9%), black-type performers from starters (11.8%) and total graded stakes winners (six). War Front's GI Preakness S.-winning son War of Will will stand for $25,000. His first yearlings sold at auction this year, going for as much as $650,000 with an average sale price of $120,132. 


 Blame (Arch) will also stand for $25,000. In addition to siring top runners including, Grade I winner Wet Paint, Blame has emerged as an important broodmare sire. Led by champion Forte, Blame has 12% stakes horses from starters, the highest percentage of any broodmare sire with 100 or more starters. The Grade I Met Mile winner Silver State (Hard Spun) will stand for $15,000. His first weanlings will arrive at auction this fall. Champion sprinter Runhappy (Super Saver) will stand for $10,000, with runners in 2023 led by Grade I winner Nutella Fella and Grade II winner Smile Happy. Dual-surface Grade I winner Catholic Boy (More Than Ready) will also stand for $10,000. His first crop of juveniles had an average progeny-winning distance of 7.26 furlongs leading all freshman sires. Veteran sire First Samurai (Giant's Causeway) will once again stand for $7,500, led by Grade II-placed Synthesis, who has earned over $648,000 over the course of his career. First Samurai's son Lea will stand for a private fee, with a resume of recent runners that includes Grade III winner Poppy Flower. Demarchelier (GB) will have his fee announced at a later time. The only son of top international sire Dubawi standing in Kentucky has gotten off the mark quickly with his first 2-year-olds, leading all freshman sires by black type performers on turf (two) and average winning distance over turf (8.05 furlongs).
