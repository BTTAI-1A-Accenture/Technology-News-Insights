ST. GEORGE — A swift water training exercise turned into reality Friday at Zion National Park, and thanks to the efforts of the rescuers, the individual’s life was saved, even though she had no pulse after being pulled from the Virgin River. According to a National Park Service press release,  around 1:15 p.m. on Friday, visitors reported to a Zion National Park ranger that a person was in the Virgin River holding onto a log and calling for help. The ranger contacted National Park Service emergency dispatchers who mobilized responders, including an ambulance from Hurricane Valley Fire District, to assist. The park service and Washington County Sheriff’s Office were conducting a joint swift water rescue training exercise near the Temple of Sinawava in Zion when the ranger made the report. Responders left their exercise and repositioned to attempt a rescue, the news release said. The team successfully pulled the person, a 25-year-old woman from Canada, from the Virgin River near Birch Creek. The patient was not responsive and did not have a pulse. However, after NPS and Hurricane Valley Fire District paramedics administered CPR, she regained her pulse. Zion emergency dispatchers had previously contacted a medical helicopter service, and park service and Hurricane Valley Fire District paramedics transported the patient to a helicopter landing zone. The patient was evacuated by air to a hospital. Copyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2023, all rights reserved. Press releases and news tips may be sent to [email protected].
