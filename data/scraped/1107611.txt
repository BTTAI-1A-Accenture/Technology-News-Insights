 Xero is an affordable cloud-based accounting software system that is highly rated among small businesses. Its simple solution for tracking income and expenses makes it easy to use for those without accounting skills. Top features for every plan include the ability to create and send invoices, track time and project profitability, claim expenses, bulk reconcile transactions and accept multiple currencies. Xero’s three plans range from $15 a month to $78 per month. The Early plan is recommended for solopreneurs. The Growing plan is the platform’s most popular and is recommended for growing businesses while the Established plan is recommended for established businesses. Each plan includes an unlimited number of users for free, which is extremely helpful for companies with several team members or a large accounting department. A major disadvantage of the Early plan is the fact it limits users to 20 quotes and invoices per month and only five bills a month. None of the three plans include a payroll component. Companies that want to link payroll to their accounting software must integrate with Gusto at $40 per month. Learn more: Read our full Xero review. Who should use it: Xero is a great option for large teams and SMBs looking for accounting software that multiple team members can use. Freelancers and entrepreneurs who want an affordable plan might want to look elsewhere simply because of its basic plan’s limitation on the number of invoices.

 When evaluating providers for this year’s list of the best cloud accounting software companies, we focused on ease of use, cost, customer service, features and functions, variety of pricing plans and customer reviews. We focused on five distinct categories using 25 separate metrics to arrive at our ratings for the best providers. Here’s a look at each of these evaluation criteria in more detail. We prioritized software that was either low-cost or had an affordable plan in a series of pricing plans. We also gave credit to those apps that either provided users with a free version of the software or at least a free trial period. When considering the affordability of cloud accounting software, many providers have promotions going where the software is greatly reduced for a brief period, then goes up in price. Those that had price increases that were reasonable fared better in our ratings. This accounted for 10% of our weighted scoring. For features and functionality, we primarily looked for software that offered fully functional accounting software providing users with a long list of useful features. Some of the features that we considered to be essential for cloud accounting software offering a mobile app, providing automatic data backup and double-entry bookkeeping, offering training in some format, and providing time tracking and payroll capabilities. Some additional features we wanted to see as well included document management, customer relationship management (CRM) integration, multicurrency support, budgeting dashboards, invoicing platforms and the ability to create purchase orders (POs) and handle bill payments. We weighted features at 50% of our total score. We researched reviews from real users to gauge their opinion of each platform. We wanted to get their opinion about how simple the software was to use and that, according to recent users, the companies provided satisfactory customer service. We looked online at popular third-party review websites, focusing on providers that received at least 300 or more positive reviews on most of these sites as well as received high marks (3.5 or higher out of 5) by the actual users of the software. These reviews accounted for 10% of the total score. Our final criteria, also based on customer responses, was determined by our panel of experts after looking at how users felt about each cloud accounting software when it came to popularity, stand-out features, value for the money and ease of use. These final criteria make up 30% of the total score. Featured Partners 1 Sage Intacct Yes Yes Yes 1 Sage Intacct On Sage's Website 2 Xero Special Offer: 75% off for 6 months Yes 30 days 2 Xero On Xero's Website 3 QuickBooks $15 per month (for the first 3-months, then $30 per month) 30 days Expert help, Invoicing, maximize tax deductions, track mileage 3 QuickBooks On QuickBooks' Website There are four basic areas you should consider when choosing a cloud accounting software solution. The first is cost, as every company needs to find something that fits into its overall budget. When considering cost, look at the monthly subscription fee costs as well as any third-party costs, such as integrations with other software, that may be necessary to have an efficient accounting system. Efficiency is the second thing to consider when choosing accounting software. Choose a platform that helps you invoice, organize tax information, accept payments and track time. Another thing to consider is ease of use. An intuitive program that gives you access to a simple dashboard that displays charts to provide an overview of the current state of your company’s finances, automatic features and easy-to-use mobile apps are best. Finally, find accounting software that integrates seamlessly with other business software. As your company grows, it might be necessary to integrate multiple types of software to scale the business. Sign up for applications that will work seamlessly with your primary business software. Cloud-based accounting software is just like traditional accounting software with the exception that all the data is hosted on remote servers instead of the user’s desktop computer. Information stored in cloud-based accounting software is encrypted meaning it is extremely difficult for cybercriminals to hack into it. Unlike data stored on a hard drive, data in the cloud is typically not susceptible to being lost due to hardware malfunctions. In most cases, yes. Since they are internet-based, most cloud software programs are designed to work well with both PCs and Macs. However, before you make your final selection, it is always best to make sure the software is compatible with your operating system. As with most types of software, the best cloud accounting software programs offer many levels of security. When choosing this type of software, you want to look for security features, including two-factor authentication (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA), documentation that shows frequent security updates and patches, intrusion detection, the monitoring of user activities, data encryption and privacy protection.
