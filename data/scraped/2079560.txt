Management Commentary
 
“We are pleased with our first quarter results. Our team generated $194 million of sales. Our revenue performance was solid across our footprint, with some softening in Illinois that caused sequential decline in revenue as well as much of the margin pressure. Our team’s relentless prioritization of providing the highest perceived value to the consumer is paying off, evidenced by Cresco Labs maintaining industry wholesale leadership with the number one selling portfolio of branded products and an incredibly productive retail platform. Our branded products reached the shelves of 1,600 dispensaries across our 10-state wholesale footprint and our Sunnyside dispensaries rang up almost 1.2 million orders,” said Charles Bachtell, CEO of Cresco Labs.

 
“After attending the first ever Senate hearing on the SAFE Banking Act, I’m encouraged by the progress at the federal level to resolve the industry’s unique banking challenges. I’m also energized by continued cannabis acceptance and normalization at the state level, with Missouri and Connecticut launching adult use sales, Kentucky passing medical cannabis and Delaware plus potentially Minnesota legalizing cannabis. We are investing wisely and rationalizing and optimizing everything we do to generate profitable revenue expansion, drive healthy margins, generate more cash and strengthen our balance sheet. At Cresco Labs, we’re optimizing for the company we are today while also preparing for the industry of tomorrow.”

Cresco Labs references certain non-GAAP financial measures throughout this press release, which may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Please see the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for more detailed information.

 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted gross profit are non-GAAP financial measures and do not have standardized definitions under U.S. GAAP. The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items and believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the business. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should only be considered in conjunction with, the U.S. GAAP financial measures presented herein. Accordingly, the Company has included below reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
