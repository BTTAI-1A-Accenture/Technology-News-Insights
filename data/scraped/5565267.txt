The pandemic allowed people to be more open to a healthy work-life balance, supported by remote, hybrid, and freelance engagements. The freelance industry, although still running on Web2 technology, has grown significantly in recent years, with more than 65% of all job workers desiring to work full-time but as remote employees. Research has shown that the global gig economy could explode beyond $450 billion by the end of 2023 and continue with exponential growth to $12 billion by 2028. Both individuals and organizations will have access to increased opportunities, allowing them to shake up traditional workspaces, at the same time, expand their freelance networks into strong industry relationships. Small businesses are approaching remote and freelance work as a cost-saving factor. One that cannot be ignored if they have to stay competitive. As for skilled professionals, freelance arrangements do not tie them down to one employer, location, or country. They have the freedom to offer their skills to several organizations at the same time, on a flexible schedule. Countries like India, the United States, and Pakistan have embraced freelancing as a career option for many years. Despite the significant expansion in the industry, only a handful of marketplaces have managed to address some of its longstanding issues. LinkedIn, Upwork, and Toptal are among the leading Web2 entities in the freelancing world, providing various services such as pre-vetted projects, round-the-clock customer assistance, and secure payment systems. However, these services often fall short of expectations, while leaving individuals with little control over their data ownership and usage. Third-party marketing companies regularly exploit user information, making it a profitable resource of revenue for centralized Web2 freelancing platforms. They typically generate revenue by imposing high commission fees on secure escrow transactions, endorsing subpar services, and leveraging their users‚Äô private information. Web2 freelance platforms exhibit some striking characteristics: Extended payment schedules, imposing steep commission rates, functioning within a centralized framework, demanding supplementary documentation and skill evaluations prior to listing services, and the presence of unscrupulous individuals. The web3 market, which was valued at $6 billion in 2021, is anticipated to witness remarkable growth, reaching nearly $64 billion by 2029. This significant expansion can be attributed primarily to the e-learning and freelancing sectors, given the extensive potential of web3 technology. A few crucial aspects that will contribute to this progress include a user-centric approach, enhanced data ownership, and a decentralized AI ecosystem, among others. Such factors will facilitate a higher level of interaction between consumers, clients, and blockchain technology. By introducing backend innovations, the web3 freelancing ecosystem will revolutionize the future of work, reshaping how it is perceived and conducted and DeeLance is at the center of it all.
