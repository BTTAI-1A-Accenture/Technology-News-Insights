Today BY BARNEY OREREborere@spp.com.pg A bird in the bush which obviously liked salt led a community in Laiagam District Enga Province to make an important discovery.  The people of Mulisoas owe a debt of gratitude to the bird they call Maiwale for the gift of salt. Moreover, it was also the observation power of one man that put the finishing touches to the clever bird’s offering. Here’s the full account of how it happened as told to the Post Courier on location; that is at Aipnakal or where there is salt. Today, Aip-nakal in Enga is an insignificant place where an occasional tourist might go to. Once- upon- a- time though, Aipnakal (Aip for salt and nakal for ‘place’ in tokples Enga) was a busy place drawing people from everywhere for the salt. The man who discovered the salt (whom you’ll meet) shortly actually started the trade (barter system). Unfortunately he’s not around to see what the white man’s salt has done to his business. His name was Konowai. A second man named Pyalyini came into the scene a bit later. The pair popularized the Highlands salt. The strange- looking pond in the bush behind present-day Mulisoas (pronounced Mulsos) would have been ignored as unattractive but Konowai was an observant person. He noticed the same bird, Maiwale, frequenting the pond for a drink so out of curiosity, Knowai scooped a bit of the water to check it and, bingo! He had discovered aip (pronounced eip) and that is how the pond got its name. The first thing that strikes the visitor is the orange colour of the pond and the sticks placed in it all those years ago which look weird; the salt having crystallized around them to give them the odd shape. UNDERGROUND SOURCEThe pond sits on the slope of a hill and is dammed by natural boulders. It can rain cats and dogs but the pond colour never changes, nor its salinity. A muted fountain gurgles from the centre of the pond to keep it alive. In the bygone era the people divided the pond into plots according to families in the tribe. Said the chief of Aipnakal, Titai Ipatu: “The sticks placed by our ancestors have not been changed to this day and will never be changed.” There were no impurities in the wood, he added. In the days gone by families built their huts by the pond to guard it, use it and to engage in the salt trade.“The salt,” continued Ipatu; “brought people from Kandep, Kompiam, Tambul, Baiyer, Tari and Wabag. The Tari extended it to Papua.” Since the arrival of the white man’s salt, the trade slowed down in the 1950s but Ipatu adds quickly that it is still popular because the people got used to it. UNIQUEThey simply fetch the water or soak a special leaf for a week to be used in preparing feasts. Marcus Kaubin has found a way to boil the water to extract salt particles which he packs in sachets to sell as far as Mt Hagen. The taste? Well, it’s got to be different; very unique. This is salt from the ground, thousands of miles away from the ocean. What the old people did was to soak logs in the pond for up to 15 weeks. These logs were dried in the sun and thrown into a huge bonfire that took days to build. When the fire died down, the ashes were gathered and packed in large leafy bundles for the trade. To buy the salt entire families came and camped. It was an experience and salt made so much difference to their food. And now we move on to where there’s no salt and for that story we go to one of PNG’s largest lakes, Lake Murray in the Middle Fly District of Western Province. Black pepper for a tasty bite – WHERE THERE IS NO SALT THERE’S GOT TO BE PEPPERWHEN you look at these pictures, they might hardly be connected to pepper but where there is no salt, they might just come in handy. Let’s take a closer look. Papua New Guinea is an amazing place where you find unusual things. Spice for seasoning food for instance might come from crops. But not in some parts of this land of the unexpected. In the Lake Murray region of Western Province, the people only use black pepper.  The reason for it is that they do not have salt.The Lake Murray black pepper is not cultivated. There are three sources of black pepper for the Baguwa, Kuni and Jimakani as well as other tribes in the region. One source is the dry spine of the coconut bunch. This is burned over a piece of corrugated iron to collect its ash. As the spines burn and fall off, bits of sago crust is thrown in with water droplets. This action traps the ash in moulds which are collected and stored. That then becomes the people’s black pepper. This was the only food spice they knew; no salt. HELACONIAThen there’s the ginger plant belonging to the helaconia variety that bears a bright orange flower (pictured at below). The flower resembles bird; some say it looks like the bird-of-paradise and even give the plant that name. The stem of the mature plant is cut and sun-dried before burning it off in the same way as the dry spines of the coconut bunch. But while the bird-of-paradise helaconia can be accessed on the ground you have to wait for the coconut bunch to dry and fall to the ground long after the nuts had been harvested. However, you can always climb and persuade them to come down if you are in a hurry. But there’s a third source. The third source is the water lily (pictured below). The stems are cut and sun-dried before twisting them like tobacco, after which it is kept over the fire place in the living quarters for some time until it breaks down. MERCURYBefore the arrival of iodised salt the people of Lake Murray depended on these three types of black pepper. Today the black pepper plays a life-saving role. Marckey Nai, a school teacher from Miwa village, Lake Murray, said a lot of his people would have succumbed to mercury found in fish. After biologists discovered high mercury content in fish around Lake Murray, doctors told the natives to eat more fruit with black pepper. The people followed the doctors’ advice and according to Marckey, they appeared to be doing alright. The secret, he said, was in eating plenty of fruit with black pepper. Lake Murray is one of the biggest lakes in Papua New Guinea. It is so vast; it takes two hours to cross by boat from one shore to the other. Among the aquatic dwellers is the Saratoga, a tasty and unique looking fish, much sought after in Asia. In spite of the mercury threat, live Saratoga fetches US$100 in nearby Indonesia. Fish stocks were depleting, said Marckey. That was some years ago but the people were safe because of black pepper. The Middle Fly District is mostly under water because of the presence of great river systems.The main method of communication is by dugout canoes that weave in and out of the numerous waterways from which the people eke out a lifestyle that has been passed down over many generations. The staple diet of the region is sago and fish. NEXT: PAPUA NEW GUINEANS CAN GROW RICE.  STAY INFORMED!
