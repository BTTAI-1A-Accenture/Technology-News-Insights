Android Headlines / Android News / Galaxy Tab S9 FE & S9 FE+ seen in live photos ahead of launch Samsung‘s Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ mid-range tablets might go official soon. The new Fan Edition (FE) tablets have already picked up several regulatory approvals, while leaks have revealed their key specs. We now also have our first live look at the duo thanks to photos shared by the South Korean certification agency Safety Korea. The agency recently certified the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ for launch in Samsung’s homeland. As part of the process, it published live photos of both devices on its official website. First spotted by TabletMonkeys, the photos show us the front of the duo, both of which are locked. We can still see relatively big bezels and one front-facing camera each, though. The Safety Korea listings for the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ don’t reveal anything else that we don’t already know. As expected, both devices will be available in Wi-Fi and cellular (5G) versions. The vanilla model has the model numbers SM-X510 (Wi-Fi) and SM-X516N (5G), while the Plus model has model numbers SM-X610 (Wi-Fi) and SM-X616N (5G). Note that these are the 5G versions of the two tablets have different model numbers in other markets. The US models are identified as SM-X516U and SM-X616U, while the international models have the model numbers SM-X516B and SM-X616B. Regardless of these identifiers, the specs of the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab S9 FE+ will remain the same globally. As you might expect, the vanilla Galaxy Tab S9 FE will be smaller, featuring a 10.9-inch display. The Plus model, on the other hand, sports a 12.4-inch display. Both tablets are rumored to be powered by Samsung’s in-house Exynos 1380 processor. Additionally, we are expecting a single rear-facing camera, S Pen support, a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, a smart connector, and a dual stereo speaker setup. Rumors are that the Galaxy Tab S9 FE series tablets will run Android 13 out of the box. That suggests the duo could debut within the next couple of months or so, as Samsung’s Android 14/One UI 6.0 update will arrive in October. Unfortunately, we don’t yet have an official word on their launch. The company did name the devices on its website recently, but the launch date is still missing. The wait may not be much longer now, so stay tuned. Copyright ©2023 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
