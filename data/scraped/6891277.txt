The IT department has confirmed that Dhoni's annual income remains unaffected despite his retirement from international cricket. Since the beginning of his international career, he has consistently been the highest individual taxpayer in Jharkhand. It is noteworthy that the former Indian captain announced his retirement from international cricket on August 15, 2020.
