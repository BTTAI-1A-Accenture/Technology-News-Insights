 Cybersecurity solutions provider CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. unveiled new protective tools for its product lineup during its Fal.Con conference in Las Vegas today. The announcements included Foundry, a no-code application development platform specifically designed for security, which caught the attention of theCUBE’s analysts. “Falcon Foundry I thought was interesting, where you can essentially create an unlimited number of response workloads,” said Dave Vellante (pictured, left), industry analyst for theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. “I don’t think CrowdStrike is going to become an observability company, but they’ll play in that space. Those are total addressable market expanders, which is very important.” Vellante spoke with theCUBE industry analyst Lisa Martin (right) at the Fal.Con event, during the keynote analysis in an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. They discussed central messages from the keynotes and CrowdStrike’s market opportunities. (* Disclosure below.) The analysts noted CrowdStrike’s candid assessment of several of its competitors during the keynote session on Tuesday. The company has also posted a detailed set of competitor comparisons on its webpage. “It’s very rare to see competitive intelligence information published on a website,” Martin said. “Normally, that’s the competitive intel team within marketing or within product that uses that for customer conversations. I just thought that was a really interesting approach.” The keynote session included a demonstration of Charlotte AI, CrowdStrike’s generative AI cybersecurity analyst. Although the company announced several new features for the AI tool, there was no mention of pricing, and the accompanying release only indicated that a “familiar and simple model of per endpoint pricing” would be available. “I was disappointed that we didn’t hear more on the pricing,” Vellante said. “I thought for a minute they were going to say: ‘Hey, for a period of time, we’re giving it away, just to see what adoption looks like and then over time start charging for it.’ I want to understand what the pricing strategy is.” Here’s the complete video discussion, part of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s coverage of the Fal.Con event:  (* Disclosure: This is an unsponsored editorial segment.
