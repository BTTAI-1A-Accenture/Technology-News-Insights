Formerly Grofers, Blinkit, the instant delivery service and its parent, food delivery platform Zomato did a collab campaign that is breaking the internet. The brands had strategically placed billboard ads. The Blinkit one reads ‘doodh mangoge doodh denge’, whereas the Zomato one takes its a notch up with ‘kheer mangoge, kheer denge.’ Thus began a viral trend that saw many other major brands jump into the bandwagon with their own quirky billboards. You would be amazed at the traction of this campaign if you check the tagged section of Zomato’s instagram profile. Here’s a few the delivery aggregator curated. But A post shared by Zomato (@zomato)
 The best one yet is by far Netflix India’s take on the trend. The desi page of the OTT behemoth wrote - ‘friday mangoge, wednesday denge.’ For the unversed, Guillermo Del Toro's ‘Wednesday’ helmed by Jane Ortega has become the most popular show ever on the streaming platform. Jane plays the titular ‘Wednesday Addams’ in the season 1 of the series.  It's a great day to go out and look at billboards 👍 pic.twitter.com/JKoAmDHwEc
