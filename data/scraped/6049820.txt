Thank you, thank you, thank you,” Fantasia told her line sisters in a clip shared on Instagram.   “I’ve always wanted to be a part of a sisterhood,” she added. “Real talk, I was like, wait a minute — we alike. We alike.” RELATED CONTENT: “Zeta Soror Introduces The Black Sororities Collection Now Available At Macy’s” “I love what you support and I love what you do and I won’t diaspoint you. I promise I won’t,” the singer told her fellow sorors.  “I got inducted tonight,” the singer said elsewhere in the clip, before proudly adding, “I am now a Sigma Gamma Rho.” Fantasia noted that keeping the secret about her inclusion in the sorority was hard, but she’s happy to now be “a part of the best sisterhood there is.” Adding to the camaraderie with her sorors, the singer later belted the “I Gotta Feeling” chant.  As Fantasia led and as others in the room chimed in, they sang: “I gotta feeling, I gotta feeling sorors. I gotta feeling, somebody’s tryna wear my blue and gold. But it takes a real woman to be a Sigma Gamma Rho.”  In the caption of a separate post, Fantasia said, “Y’all have no idea how long I been waiting to share this news!! I’ve officially been inducted as an Honorary #SigmaGammaRho ðŸ’™ðŸ©ðŸ’›. #D9 #sorority #prettypoodle THANK YOU… I am overjoyed.” RELATED CONTENT: “Divine 9 Stand Up!
