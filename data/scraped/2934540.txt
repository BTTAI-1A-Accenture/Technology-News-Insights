     Despite spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on upgrading its security equipment, theft is out of control at this Giant Food chain. (Credit: DC Councilman Trayon White) A Giant grocery store in Washington D.C. is removing brands like Advil, Colgate and Tide from their shelves in an effort to avoid shutting down due to high rate of theft.  The grocery chain has already taken drastic steps to increase security. Giant shoppers will also be required to show their receipts before exiting the store, according to the Washington Post.   "We want to continue to be able to serve the community, but we can’t do so at the level of significant loss or risk to our associates that we have today," Giant president Ira Kress told the Post.  Giant introduced widespread changes to their stores in May by increasing security, limiting entrances and locking down some of their products.

"The alternative is worse for customers," he told the Post in May. "The last thing I want to do is close stores. But I’ve got to be able to run them safely and profitably." The Giant Food president told the Washington Post on Saturday that at the D.C. location on Alabama Avenue, things have only gotten worse.  "And we’ve invested a significant amount of money here, even more security here than any other store," he said.

"But the reality is that Tide is not a profitable item in this store… In many instances people stock the product and within two hours it’s gone, so it’s not on the shelf anyway."
