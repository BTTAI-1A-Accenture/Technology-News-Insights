SEARCH LANGUAGE FOLLOW US ON FEEDBACK  A few weeks back when John Wick: Chapter 4 released, it collected Rs. 27 crores at the box office post its weekend. Of course, these numbers also included Rs. 2.50 crores that came from Thursday paid preview shows. Now Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 has hit the screens and while it didn't have any paid previews, its weekend numbers stand at Rs. 24 crores, which is on the same lines as the Keanu Reeves starrer.  Just like the earlier installments of John Wick, even Guardians of the Galaxy hasn't seen any notable run with the previous films. In fact the weekend collections of Vol. 2 were merely Rs. 7.60 crores whereas Vol. 3 has seen more than triple of that coming in. However, there is one key difference and that's the franchise value of Marvels' Avengers that has increased manifold over the years. Since Guardians of the Galaxy characters have featured there, the recall factor helps. Hence, one would have expected better numbers with at least Rs. 30 crores been crossed. However, this wasn't really the case as growth was rather muted for the film on day by day basis. Sunday collections stood at Rs. 9 crores*, which means a double digit score never came for the film. Now had the word of mouth been truly fantastic then the Rs. 10 crores mark would have been crossed at least on Sunday. In a way, the collections are on the same lines as Marvels' last release Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which had collected Rs. 24.10 crores over the weekend. Now one waits to see how does Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 proceed from here on. *Estimates. Final numbers awaited Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources        Skip this step for now   5000 characters remaining
