There are lots of important decisions you’ll need to make when shopping for diamond jewelry—terms like cut, carat, color, and clarity will probably be ringing in your ears by the time you’re done! However, there’s one more key choice you’ll need to make as you shop, and that’s whether you want a natural or lab-grown diamond.  As you might know, natural diamonds are created in nature and found through mining, while lab-grown diamonds are made using advanced technological methods in a laboratory setting. Chemically and visually, the two types of stones are the same, but lab-grown diamonds are significantly more affordable, making them an unbeatable choice if you want the most bang for your buck. Not convinced lab-grown diamonds shine as bright as their natural counterparts? Whether you’re looking for an engagement ring, fashion piece, or a super-sparkly gift for someone special, here are several swoon-worthy lab-grown diamond rings that will change your mind.

Natural diamonds are formed deep in the earth when carbon atoms are exposed to intense heat and pressure, and in the mid-1900s, scientists figured out how to recreate these conditions in a lab setting to create new diamonds.  Today, lab-grown diamonds can be made using two different methods: High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT), or Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). With HPHT, carbon is put into a machine that simply replicates the high levels of pressure and temperature needed to form new diamonds. Alternatively, with CVD, a small piece of a pre-existing diamond is put into a vacuum-sealed chamber with hydrogen and carbon, and over time, crystallized carbon forms around the seed to create a larger diamond. It usually takes around six to 10 weeks to create a lab-grown diamond.  In short, yes, lab-grown diamonds are real diamonds. Chemically and visually, lab-grown stones are identical to natural diamonds, and they have the same physical properties. Lab-grown diamonds are more affordable simply because they’re much easier to source.  Lab-grown diamonds shouldn’t be confused with diamond simulants, such as moissanite and cubic zirconia. These stones are made to look similar to diamonds, but they don’t have the same chemical makeup or physical properties. As such, they’re generally much cheaper than either natural or lab-grown diamonds.
