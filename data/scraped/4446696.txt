Parlor Doughnuts, a fast-growing brand offering upscale doughnuts, desserts and savory breakfast sandwiches, has opened its first location in Indianapolis. The Evansville-based craft doughnut shop features layered-style doughnuts in more than 20 flavors, the likes of bourbon caramel, turtle cheesecake, Dreamsicle and lemonade. The menu includes vegan, gluten-free and keto-friendly options. Milkshakes are offered in the same flavors as the doughnuts. Parlor Doughnuts also serves acai bowls, breakfast sandwiches and tacos. The Indy store, at 805 W. 10th St. near the IUPUI campus, began operating with limited hours — 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. — July 27. It will expand its operating hours to 6:30 p.m. starting Aug. 18.
