Attend the Summit AUSTIN, TX – From AXIOS: As South by Southwest heads into its final weekend, it's clear that AI has taken over this year's conference and festivals. AI — or artificial intelligence — has rapidly developed in recent years and has the power to transform everyday tasks. You've probably seen dozens of headlines on ChatGPT, a new generative AI system that lets users pose questions and give directions to a bot that can answer with conversation, sonnets, recipes and more. The SXSW schedule features dozens of panels about AI, while brands have held meetups and shown off their AI technology at parties and events. Execs of companies like Reddit, Grammarly and Indeed — and even government officials and university researchers — discussed how AI could play a role in their work. Meanwhile, U.S. Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter said in a SXSW panel that the department has hired data scientists to "make sure we have the ability to understand that technology." Read on SOUTH CAROLINA – Integrated Media Publishing in partnership with Erik Weir are hosting the inaugural Entrepreneurial StartUp Series and Competition. Called, "The $30K PowerUp: A South Carolina StartUp Competition," three companies will be selected to be featured in all three magazines each month from April through October of 2023. Judging will be based on judges’ scores along with social media votes. Any South Carolina-based scalable StartUps established in business three years or less will be eligible to enter and companies must have received less than $500K in funding. Integrated Media is the publisher of Greenville Business Magazine, Columbia Business Monthly, and Charleston Business Magazine. For more info contact Michael Evans at 864-271-1105 ext 187 or mevans@indexx.com RALEIGH, NC – As it opens up to self-publishers, the Epic Games Store will not allow pornographic video games, one of the store’s few content prohibitions alongside hateful content and fraudulent games. The ban on adult content, common for many major online gaming storefronts, is another point of distinction between Epic’s marketplace and Valve’s Steam service, which allows some types of sexual games and sees them chart well. “This isn't Epic moral preaching here,” Epic Games Store CEO Tim Sweeney tells Axios. “Where there's lawful porn, if adults want to engage with it, that's their right,” he said. “But we're building an ecosystem that tries to convey a set of values about the content it hosts. It would be very hard to be a porn company as we're trying to be the things that are really hardcore to our business model.” Read on WILMINGTON, NC – On April 13 Network for Entrepreneurs in Wilmington (NEW) will host Scot Wingo, a serial entrepreneur, leader of the Triangle Tweener Fund and a part-time Wrightsville Beach resident. Wingo is a four-time founder with startups including Stingray Software, AuctionRover (acquired) , ChannelAdvisor (IPO) and GetSpiffy.
