 Some photographers are hesitant to build their own websites because they think it’ll be too difficult. Here’s the good news: there’s nothing complicated about building a website with Wix. Forbes considers Wix one of the most beginner-friendly website builders available today. Wix offers more than 800 templates you can customize for your photography business needs. All paid plans come with a free custom domain for one year, a storage space allotment—which varies by plan—and a free SSL certificate. Wix pricing tends to run on the higher side, although you can build a limited-feature website with Wix for free. The key difference between the two categories of Wix plans is whether e-commerce is available. If you don’t plan on selling photos or photography services on your website, you’ll want to go with one of Wix’s four core website plans. Make sure the plan you pick offers the storage space you need—which ranges from 2GB to 100GB. Photographers planning to accept payments online will need one of Wix’s Business and eCommerce plans; there are three from which to choose. All e-commerce plans include unlimited products, abandoned cart recovery, social channel selling, customer accounts and secure online payments. Storage space ranges from 50GB to unlimited.

 Building a WordPress website can be a bit daunting, especially if you’ve never built a website or have limited technical skills. Yet, if you want complete creative control over your photography website, there’s simply no better platform than WordPress.org. WordPress is open-source software, so it’s free; it’s also one of the most widely used content management systems (CMS) for creating websites. Building a WordPress website will give you complete control over the look and functionality of your photography website. Choose from tens of thousands of WordPress themes; many themes are free, though others are Premium. You could build your site from scratch if you have strong coding and design skills. Customize your site using WordPress plugins, which add additional site functionality. There are plugins for all types of features, including e-commerce, appointment scheduling, event calendars, social sharing, client galleries, watermarks, invoicing, client proofing and WordPress SEO. There are two WordPress options—WordPress.org vs. WordPress.com—and it’s important you not confuse them, as they are quite different. WordPress.com hosts your website for you but comes with tight constraints on what you can do. That’s why Forbes Advisor recommends that photographers go with WordPress.org for their business websites. With WordPress.org, you must procure hosting for your website separately. The best WordPress hosting services offer secure, reliable hosting at reasonable prices, which range from a few dollars to a few hundred dollars per month, depending on the services you purchase. You’ll also need a domain for your website; the best domain registrars charge between $10 and $50 per year to register a domain. Learn more: Read our full WordPress.org review. Who should use it: WordPress.org is the best website platform for photographers who want complete control over website design. Pricing  $12 per month ($8 per month with annual plan)

 As a photographer, your custom-designed website enhances your credibility far better than merely having an online presence on social channels or photographer groups. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, and a professional website is an ideal place to showcase your creative abilities and photography expertise. Here are the top benefits of launching a professional photography website: When done right, a website will make you look more professional, generate buzz for your work and help you monetize your talents. That’s why top photographers always have a gorgeous website. While there are several excellent website builders available today, there isn’t one single solution that’s best for every photographer. To choose the best website builder for you, it’s wise to explore several options based on how well each meets your needs and budget. To determine what you need for your photography website, ask yourself: Once you have a clear idea of what you need, you can evaluate website builders based on features offered, budget and user-friendliness. Not all website builders are the same. Some, such as SmugMug and Format, were developed specifically for creative professionals. These platforms are packed with built-in features that photography businesses frequently use, such as client galleries, file transfers, print order-taking tools and client contracts. Not all platforms offer the same features, so decide which features matter most to you. Here is a list of top features for photography websites: Here are a few popular add-on services: You can launch a website for free or spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year on your site. It’s best to choose a website builder that accommodates your budget, preferably one that can grow with you as your needs change and your photography business grows. The chart below illustrates how much you should pay to design and host your website for the first year.       					Service                 					Cost*                 					Notes                    Domain Name   $10 to $50 per year   Some website builders include custom domain registration for free for up to 12 months. Top domain registrars typically charge between $10 and $50 per year.     Website Builder   $0 to $500 per month   If you’re on a shoestring budget, there are a few good free website builders, but the best website builders charge a fee for creating a professional, e-commerce-enabled website.     Hosting When Not Included With Builder   $0 to $500 per month   Hosting is often included in website builder plans. When you need to secure hosting separately, the best website hosting services offer a variety of plan tiers to accommodate various needs and budgets.     SSL Certificate   $0 to $289   You’ll need to get a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate for your website. Most website builders offer an SSL for free, but the best SSL services offer additional SSL options.     Expert Design Services   $0 to $3,500   You may want to contract with a website designer to create your website for you. Design services average $75 to $125 per hour.     Total   $0 to $4,839                See More See Less  
*Note that domain registration, hosting service providers and website builders often offer introductory pricing, so fees can rise by 20% to 50% or more when the introductory offer expires. You want to select a website builder that’s relatively easy to use and still offers the design customizations you require. If you want extensive design control over your website, you’ll need to go with a more complex builder, such as WordPress.org. If you’re technically proficient, this won’t be a problem. If you need a beginner-friendly builder, even though that means less control over website design, select a platform that focuses on user-friendliness, such as Wix.

We considered everything that photographers need around pricing and features as well as what real users of the website builders think of the companies and what our experts determined when taking everything into consideration. Here are some of the categories we used to rank the providers that made the top of the list. For pricing, we looked at the affordability of a website builder’s lowest and highest price tiers and what users received with each higher-priced tier. We also gave points to those website builders for photographers that offered money-back guarantees. Being graphics-heavy, certain features are essential to have for website builders for photographers. Among these include offering unlimited bandwidth and storage, drag-and-drop functionality for creating websites and making sure the sites are responsive for visitors using mobile devices. Additionally, having access to social media and email marketing tools are also important to those who need photography-themed website builders. Taking a close look at popular third-party review websites G2 and Trustpilot, we researched reviews from real users to gauge their opinion of each website builder. We focused on how users viewed each site builder’s level and quality of customer support. Taking all of this information into consideration, we also ranked additional criteria from customer reviews, such as popularity, value for the price, ease of use and stand-out features.

The best free website builder for photographers is Weebly, though GoDaddy and Wix offer free options worth a closer look too.
