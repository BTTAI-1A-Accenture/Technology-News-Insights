When Stanford students Tony Xu, Evan Moore, Stanley Tang, and Andy Fang launched Palo Alto Delivery in 2013, they envisioned a business that would deliver merchandise and food from local restaurants and retailers. They pinned flyers to student-housing bulletin boards to promote the on-campus delivery business. The company soon renamed itself DoorDash.  "Ultimately, our vision is to build the local, on-demand Fedex," DoorDash wrote in an October 2013 Medium post.  Ten years later, the delivery company founded in a Stanford dorm room is a juggernaut in the $123 billion food-delivery space, with more than 500,000 stores on its app, and a market cap of more than $30 billion. The company started with food delivery but has since expanded to offer on-demand delivery of groceries, beauty supplies, and convenience store goods.  It competes with Grubhub, Uber Eats, Instacart, and rapid-delivery players like Gopuff.  To mark the company's 10th anniversary, Insider has put together 10 of the delivery operator's most significant milestones.  In the early days of DoorDash, the founders interviewed more than 200 small business owners in the Bay Area of California.  "We kept hearing the same thing over and over again: deliveries are painful," DoorDash wrote in a 2013 Medium post.  Food delivery had the biggest demand, so the founders said they put their "coding hats on and built" the company's first prototype app in a few hours.  In February 2013, they launched the app and within 30 minutes, had their first order, according to a TechCrunch article. The four founders did the first 200 deliveries. By 2015, the nascent food delivery space exploded. By the end of 2015, DoorDash expanded to 22 markets in the US including, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, Manhattan, Boston, Washington D.C., Houston, and Dallas.  That same year, DoorDash hit 1 million deliveries. In 2015, DoorDash's biggest competitors were Grubhub, Postmates, and Uber Eats. To gain market share, DoorDash went after large, established restaurant chains. Early partnerships included Buffalo Wild Wings, Jack in the Box, Wendy's, Taco Bell, and The Cheesecake Factory. The former head of business development at DoorDash, Prahar Shah, told Insider during a 2022 interview that big chains created demand for the service. Plus, they help "seed the market for us."   DoorDash expanded to Toronto, Canada, in 2015, delivering food from more than 120 restaurants initially. The company has since opened corporate offices in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. In 2022, DoorDash launched a partnership with Loblaws, Canada's largest grocery retailer. DoorDash delivers groceries from 1,100 Loblaws stores listed on the DoorDash app. Additionally, DoorDash launched 30-minute delivery with Loblaws in 2022. Dubbed PC Express Rapid Delivery, it is now available across Canada.  Today, DoorDash works with more than 500,000 merchants across over 25 countries.  DoorDash Drive is the company's white-label delivery platform. The service, available since 2016, allows merchants to offer delivery through their digital channels â€” a feature rivals like Grubhub and Uber Eats didn't offer until years later. Chipotle and Wingstop were early adopters of the program, which has since expanded to include last-mile delivery for retailers, supermarkets, and convenience stores.  Casey North, vice president of DoorDash Drive, told Insider in 2022 that Drive is "a key part of the business because it empowers our merchant partners to meet customers where they are."  DoorDash introduced the subscription service DashPass in 2018. Consumers who sign up for the $9.99 monthly membership program are not charged a delivery fee and receive reduced service fees. The subscription program built loyalty for DoorDash as it went head-to-head with market leader Grubhub in 2018. By the end of 2022, DashPass members totaled over 15 million, up from 10 million in 2021.   DashPass is valid for all DoorDash deliveries including restaurants, grocery stores, and drug stores. As DoorDash adds more retail categories to its app, "consumers graduate to DashPass, and that's what's driving the strength in the business, both domestically as well as internationally," Ravi Inukonda, chief financial officer, said during DoorDash's first-quarter earning call in May.  Rivals Grubhub and Uber Eats launched their membership programs in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  Grubhub, founded in 2004, led the online ordering and delivery space for years. At the start of 2018, the well-established company owned half the market, while DoorDash controlled only 17%. But 12 months later, in early 2019, DoorDash surged past Grubhub, according to transaction data from Bloomberg Second Measure.   DoorDash leapfrogged over Grubhub by going after suburbs and partnering with big fast food chains. DoorDash has been on top ever since, owning 65% of the market today. From the beginning, DoorDash's mission was to service all types of merchants, not just restaurants. In 2018 and 2019, DoorDash began testing last-mile delivery with retailers like Walmart and Wegmans. In 2020, DoorDash went all in with on-demand delivery from grocery and convenience stores through partnerships with 7-Eleven, Wawa, Casey's General Store, and Circle K. Grocery stores and retailers found on the DoorDash's app today include Sprouts Farmers Market, Aldi, Albertsons, Vons, Grocery Outlet, PetSmart, Dick's Sporting Goods, Sephora, and Party City.   DoorDash also launched its own direct-to consumer grocery delivery service through DashMart in August 2020. The company sells various household essentials, from ice cream to chips to cough medicine, from dozens of dark warehouses throughout the US.   DoorDash filed a confidential draft registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2020 to go public. The company was performing well during the pandemic, when delivery orders were surging. It began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on December 9, 2020. The company set an initial public offering price of $102 per share. On the first day it closed at nearly $190 per share. According to the New York Times, that valued the company at $72 billion, more than the market capitalization of Domino's and Chipotle combined. Having raised more than $3.4 billion, DoorDash's IPO was one of the largest of 2020, the Times stated. Today, amid market volatility over the past year, DoorDash's stock hovers at nearly $77 a share.  In 2021, DoorDash went on a buying spree. It announced plans to purchase Wolt in an all-stock deal valued at $8.1 billion. The deal with the Finnish food-delivery company closed in 2022, allowing DoorDash to expand its global footprint. Wolt's platform operates in 23 countries. Also, in 2021, DoorDash bought Chowbotics, the maker of a robot vending machine named "Sally" that prepares custom salads in under a minute. DoorDash explored ways to help merchants grow by leveraging Chowbotics' automated vending technology. However, the company shut down the operation last summer. In 2022, DoorDash bought food tech startup Bbot, a contactless ordering and payment platform.  DoorDash marked its 10th birthday last week by rolling out a slew of major changes to its app that impact restaurants, gig drivers, and customers. Changes include adding a global search option, multiple carts, and accepting SNAP payments for grocery delivery with brands such as Safeway, Albertsons, Meijer, Aldi, and 7-Eleven. The company also changed how it pays its food delivery drivers, or Dashers. The two changes include allowing Dashers to earn more tips through a new post-checkout tipping feature. The company is also giving its gig workers a choice to earn by the hour instead of by delivery order. Though DoorDash laid off 1,250 corporate workers last year after growing too fast during the pandemic, the company continues to see demand for delivery. In its latest quarter, DoorDash saw total orders increase 27% year over year as revenue surpassed $2 billion. Still, the company, like other third-party delivery apps, remains unprofitable.
