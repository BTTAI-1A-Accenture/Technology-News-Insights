 This initiative was purely focused on spreading the message of empowering underprivileged children in the community. Reach 3Roads tenants, also the well-known brands that supported the walkathon were Sagar Ratna, Wow Momo, Sodhi’s Supermarket, Chaayos, and Hype The Gym. 
 
Reach Group & IRRAH enthusiastically supported the objectives of the Shubham Tyagi Foundation, which is committed to ensuring that children not only survive but thrive. They have been tirelessly working to create a better world in which every child is safe, cared for, and given opportunities to live a fulfilling life. The foundation’s support and presence in this walkathon have been vital in raising people’s consciousness regarding these children.



As a part of the walkathon, there were various performances by children from the NGOs, followed by fun-filled activities for enthusiastic participants. Reach 3Roads tenants and IRRAH participated whole heartedly by sponsoring meals and gifts for the children and discount offers for participants. Furthermore, the registered users also received certificates after completing the walk for the cause.

Commenting on the same, Nandini Taneja, Vice President, Reach Group, said, “We at Reach Group have always believed in giving society back, and organising such events is helping us to fulfil this goal. This initiative successfully echoed the message that every child deserves a fair chance to succeed in life. As a valued member of the community, these children must be inspired to dream big and as they have the potential to make a positive impact in the world. Through this walkathon, we were able to encourage the spirit of kindness, hope, and compassion. The little steps we took will surely be effective in creating a better tomorrow for these children.”

The event turned out to be an opportunity for the community to come together and make a positive difference in the lives of those in need. Reach Group is firm in its belief that it also raised awareness about the challenges faced by these children and the importance of supporting their growth and development. 




Reach Group is a real estate development firm with projects spanning over 2 million square feet across retail, commercial, and residential. Driven by the promise to deliver top-quality commercial and retail space on time, every time, the group works with passion, commitment, and diligence.
