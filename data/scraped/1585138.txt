Lol.. Na dem,. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£Obi for president Wizkid FC Proudly TIV  Thank God Korra didn't use twerking sex break his manh**d,  this guy for sue her o. #NothingWeWontHear Unless she got married for visa reasons there was nothing there. Cause the way this has turned out, apart from the children, the union was a complete waste of time. Please use wisdom next time.  I admire korra's strength, I wish to borrow such from her, standing tall despite distraction aside her nakedness she has something great to offer.  Honestly. She has so much to offer. I love her spirit. She would have married him out of love, imagine paying part of your bride price plus paying after divorce. If her case was the reverse they will call her good digger. Thatâ€™s sad. After the history we had with oyinbo, if any African woman is marrying oyinbo it should be to her benefit and she must ensure the oyinbo is treating her like a spoiled princess.  Abeg . Ur people canâ€™t get hurt by oyinbo twice. If ur marrying oyinbo make sure to vet him  seriously for his psychological health, financial responsibility, if he has tiny Hidden racist tendencies as well, his values and beliefs. Donâ€™t just come here and say all oyinbo men are bad because of this one example. Because African men treat African women 10 times worse, especially those living in Africa  Seriously. Ancestors don suffer without choice, you come suffer by choice. Any oyinbo marriage you must be treated like egg, adored and put on a pedestal. You canâ€™t be coming to work and shake and gyrate for the public, take cussing and judgments to turn around and use the money you suffer to make to give to your horseband. She said he made her pay off his school loans. He brought up divorce after she paid off 10k than 40k making it 50k USD. The 19 year old he was cheating with got mad when Korra had a second baby because he told her he was no longer sleeping with his wife. The day I watched the video he posted of him buying her a car was the day I knew Korra don enter one chance. To film such an embarrassing car with pride showed that something wasn't quite right and people where blasting Korra for not jumping up and down when she saw the car. I felt sorry for her. People just hate her guts and sided with this man but not me.  I like this lady but her nakedness dey tire me,I wish she can be convering up abit  50,000 USD?? Anty where did u get that kind of money? This is not Naira oo. Even in the US, someone that can be ordered to pay that amount earns more and anybody that earns more than 50k USD is not a small person even over there. Pls ladies dey sofri dey lie.Naso that year that our big anty carry one yellow stone dey shout upandan that her kingkong gave her big yellow diamond as engagement ring, wen d marriage packed up, she came wt this same line, that she paid her bride price and that everyother thing she said he bought her was also a lie. She bought house 1 million USD because that is what she cale to social media to say, as i type behind my keyboard too, i can say yesterday i bought a house in banana island. Secondly, i hope you know most people get to own houses esp in Europe n US through mortgages. So do not be surprised, if she bought the house for a million dollars thru mortgage and is still paying for it, cos that 1m USD cnt be outright payment, else police would have picked her up to explain how she came by such money. Itâ€™s not naija where 1million Naira is nth. She has a wide following across several money making social media platforms. Her YouTube and Facebook alone should be raking in thousands of dollars a month. She has endorsements, a book ot two and has released several songs with videos which should also yield income per click or stream. Despite all, she is quite a talented dancer and singer. And I don't think she's lying about buying a 1mill house. I once lived in California where she lives and average home price where I lived was 2 million dollars. A one bedroom was like 4000/month. Given that she has 2 kids and maybe a nanny, renting for 4 of them wouldn't make sense for her, so it's most likely true. If she's lying she's probably reducing the actual home cost...Your 2nd paragraph actually validates her story that she did more spending than we think. People saying she bought it through mortgage, for her to quality for a 1 million dollar house is an indication of her income. The amount of mortgage you get depends on your earning. Some people don't even qualify for 100k mortgage so if you think buying a million dollar house on mortgage is a joke, you obviously don't live abroad or bad belle dey worry you. Before u marry any oyinbo, look well o, naija  women are not taught how to study men well before jumping into marriage. Stop looking on the surface, ask the right questions, note red flags. Donâ€™t focus on the sex , sweet words or romantic gestures. Especially sex, if that can wait longer then your judgement is less clouded. Thatâ€™s why many men try to rush sex, inviting women to their house n seduce them. Because they know a womanâ€™s thinking faculty stops working after sex n he now has leverage to get in her head. Iâ€™ll be so horny and wanting to have sex when I date an attractive guy but immediately those red flags show my legs are down tight. Thatâ€™s what has kept me celibate, not that I donâ€™t get the urge. I do seriously. But Iâ€™m very sensitive to red flags It means you are slow, if men can get into your head with sex.  17:17Try to understand that she was referring to old , tried and tested manipulative tactics used by men to deceive womenIt is wisdom not to let guard down, no awards for promiscuity and acquiring soul ties and high body countAshawo lifestyle no dey pay  This bride price issue na wa.Babes stop helping a man do his duty, ehen you begin a marriage lije this how do you expect it to pan out? Thank you for the truth.  A lot of ladies pay their own bride price these days and it never ends well.My aunty paid her own bride price.Even if my mom warned her about this man, She insisted and my mom supported her. Right now they are divorced. It's safe to say that a man that cannot pay his wife's bride price can never make a good  husband. Sense dey this  I paid part of my bride price but my husband is an angel. Twelve years in marriage now and it's bliss. We are still like friends, he has never hit me and I have never caught him cheating. He also provides for the home now 100% as I lost my job later and he is now doing well.So it  is not all men, those ladies married bad men. Hmmmm good for yaaa I used calculator and saw almost 150m. That's huge. If you live abroad and earn in a different currency, there is no point converting to naira. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” I totally agree. Itâ€™s very clear that this marriage was a contra. It wasnâ€™t real at all
