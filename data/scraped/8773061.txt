Tuesday, 20 August 27 Sep 2023 Members of the Bloemfontein SPCA are now very busy assisting animals in areas affected by the many veld fires. In one of these missions to save animals on Wednesday, 20 September, members of the SPCA came upon a cow trapped in a crevice on the outskirts of the Thaba Nchu district. Reinet Meyer, chief inspector, said the cow somehow managed to get stuck in a crevice inside a slope on a hill.  “The opening was very narrow. We believed she missed a step en landed in the crevice. She tried to free herself, but as her legs were underneath her body, her whole wheight was resting on them.” Lucky for her, the SPCA members took action and first removed some gravel and rocks trapping the cow. They then tied ropes and a harnass around her and pulled her out using two SPCA vehicles to free her. “The cow was very weak after the ordeal, but soon she got up and started grazing again,” Meyer said. She said the cow was not hurt.  “The SPCA is there for any animal in need – be it cruelty or an animal that needs to be rescued. The public can contact us if they see any animal in distress.” The SPCA in Bloemfontein can be reached at 051-447-3801 or 078-322-8332 after hours.  19 Aug Indulge in the finer things
