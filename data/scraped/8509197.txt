The public will be allowed in at 2pm with the first session offered free. The facility has had a full refurb and will now open for outdoor swimming from April through to the end of September. The pool has been reduced from 72m to a 50m Olympic length pool, making room for a new interactive splash pad and slides, plus a decking area. The spiral flume is nearly six metres high, with the racer slides around three metres high. The pool has also been made shallower with a new depth of 0.9m-1.58m. The 0.9m depth runs for 20m. Existing buildings have been improved and accessible changing facilities are in place. The lido was first built as an unheated pool in 1870, extended in 1914, and completely rebuilt in 1937, at which point it was believed to be the largest pool in the South of England. Lee Dillon, leader of West Berkshire Council, said: “We’re incredibly proud of the new lido. “The pool is absolutely stunning and the slides and splash pad are a brilliant addition that will be enjoyed by families in West Berkshire and beyond for generations to come.” Those wishing to visit will need to create a free booking profile.
