The Ethereum blockchain provides a secure platform for artists to upload proprietary assets, which are then hashed and sent to nodes for rendering. RNDR payments are stored in escrow during rendering and are released to node operators only after manual verification by the commissioning artist of successful work. This system ensures that artists receive high-quality rendering services, while node operators receive payment only for verified work. If you're an artist looking to leverage the power of blockchain and secure rendering services, RNDR is a perfect choice.
