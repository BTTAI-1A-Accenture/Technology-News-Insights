Saoirse Ronan has opened up on her friendship with Paul Mescal, revealing they had a ‘genuine friendship,’ and not just a ‘Hollywood friendship.’ The Irish actress revealed they had known each other ‘in passing’ but grew closer when co-starring in a new dystopian sci-fi thriller, Foe, which was filmed in Australia. The pair star as a married couple who have their world turned upside down following the arrival of a stranger at their farm.  Speaking to Grace Coddington in Document, Saoirse said: ‘We knew each other sort of in passing before, just through friends. ‘We’ve become very, very close since making the film.’ The Ladybird star added: ‘We’re genuine friends; we’re not Hollywood friends.’ A release date for Foe has not yet been finalised, however, it is understood Amazon Studios entered negotiations for the distribution rights of the flick in July 2021. In other Paul Mescal movie news, the Maynooth star recently released his first-ever single, Slip Away, ahead of his next movie appearance.
