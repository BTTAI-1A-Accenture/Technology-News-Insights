The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has become the first utility company in California to use remote drones in its operations. The company says the drones will be used to examine equipment and quickly identify any issues. "The drones are looking for any defects to the assets,” said PG&E’s Jon Teach. Teach heads up the company’s remote drone program, which he said adds "reliability and efficiency."PG&E has teamed up with Skydio, one of the largest drone companies, to put docks around PG&E's coverage areas."Instead of having a drone tied to a single person, what you now have is a dock that's enabled to fly autonomously without other people," said Skydio’s Katrina Armstead.Come next week, PG&E will have five working docks in Northern California, which include Livermore, Tiger Creek near Pioneer, St. Helena at the Silverado substation, and a site in Tracy.  The drones are launched by an operator from behind a computer screen and that employee can be anywhere in the world. "The goal is to implement this technology throughout the system," Teach said.  By the end of the year, Teach says 12 docks will be in operation. “It's amazing that we have this capability to operate a drone as long as we have an internet connection," Teach said.  | MORE PG&E COVERAGE | Regulators want to scale back PG&E's $6 billion proposal   Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.
