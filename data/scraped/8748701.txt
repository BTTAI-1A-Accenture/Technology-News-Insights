Dr. Katelyn Lehman, Quantum clinic co-founder, on tapping the power of biotech-driven preventative mental healthcare to live happier, healthier lives  Combining biotech-driven modalities for preventative care can create a powerful tool for maintaining optimal physical and mental health and deterring chronic illnesses.”  - Katelyn Lehman, Ph.D. CORAL SPRINGS, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES, May 2, 2023/einpresswire.com / -- Amid May Mental Health Awareness Month it's timely to consider that mental health problems stemming from lifestyle concerns like stress, loneliness/isolation, anxiety, trauma, debt, bereavement, medical issues, social media and more are at an all-time high. In fact, new Gallup findings indicate stress, sadness and worry have all inched higher worldwide-pushing Gallup's Negative Experience Index to another new high. As the results of which wreak havoc on society, families and individual well-being, there's an escalating movement toward preventative mental healthcare, including that being offered in a wellness spa setting. 
Indeed, the good news is that there are numerous technologies and methodologies determined to help us alleviate the angst in our lives. BioWellness pioneer dr. katelyn lehman , co-founder of quantum clinic -a model of preventative healthcare, puts the emphasis on psychological, emotional, spiritual and physical wellbeing for epigenetic healing through coherence-the degree of correlation between the body's electromagnetic fields.
Dr. Lehman underscores that interventions and modalities like floatation REST, frequency therapy, scalar energy and more can employed to combat stressors that can negatively impact our physical, mental and emotional well-being. 
.Frequency therapy - a non-invasive treatment that uses frequencies to restore balance to the body's energy systems. These frequencies can be applied to target specific health issues, such as pain, inflammation, and anxiety. This therapy works by stimulating the body's natural healing mechanisms, promoting cell regeneration, and reducing oxidative stress. It has been shown to be effective in treating a range of conditions, including chronic pain, autoimmune disorders, and depression.
.Scalar energy – while this is a type of energy that is not easily measurable by conventional scientific instruments, its effects on living organisms have been studied for decades. One of the areas in which scalar energy has been found to be particularly relevant is in the communication between cells, specifically within the context of water in intracellular communication. One of the ways that scalar energy may influence the structure of water is through the use of scalar energy devices. Scalar energy devices are designed to emit scalar energy waves, which are believed to interact with water molecules and influence their molecular structure. These devices may be used to enhance the structure of water in the body, promoting intracellular communication and improving overall health and wellness. While the theory of scalar energy and water in intracellular communication is still a relatively new concept, it has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the human body and its functions. By exploring the role of scalar energy in facilitating intracellular communication, we may be able to develop new therapies and treatments for a wide range of health conditions, from chronic illness to acute injuries.
.Floatation REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy) - a form of sensory deprivation therapy that involves floating in a tank filled with salt water. The water is heated to body temperature, and the tank is designed to block out external stimuli, such as light and sound. This creates a state of deep relaxation, allowing the body to enter a state of deep rest and repair. Floatation REST has been shown to reduce stress, improve sleep quality, and enhance creativity.
“Combining these modalities for preventative care can create a powerful tool for maintaining optimal health and preventing chronic illnesses,” notes Dr. Lehman.“Doing so can create a comprehensive approach to preventative care that addresses the root causes of chronic illnesses, rather than just treating the symptoms. By providing a non-invasive and natural approach to promoting relaxation and stress reduction, individuals can learn to manage their own health without relying on costly medical interventions. By taking a holistic approach to our health and well-being, we can live happier, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.”
In all, Dr. Lehman's Quantum Clinic is building a movement centered around radical reconnection-with nature, our own bodies, our intuition and one another. With a profound belief that all healing is a result of empowerment and awareness building, the clinic offers a deeply deliberated space to facilitate your deepest transformation and self-healing through coherence.
