During this period, BTC faced difficulty in surpassing the $27,500 threshold and began a corrective downward trend. The continuation of this downward movement may persist if BTC fails to maintain its current position. Concurrently, Ethereum followed a similar pattern, declining by 1 percent over the preceding day and is presently being traded at approximately $1,800, following the suit of BTC.” WazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon said, “Bitcoin surpassed $27,000 at the start of the week. The forthcoming debt ceiling talks may determine whether investors view BTC as a safe-haven asset amid regulatory uncertainty. BTC is currently stable, but a risk-averse scenario could lead to selling pressure. Liquidity issues and regulatory ambiguity have caused market makers to retreat from Crypto trading. On WazirX, dYdX (DYDX) and Smooth Love Potion (SLP) have been the top gainers in the last 24 hours.” Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin said, “ETH/BTC trading pair has become more volatile than before. Interestingly, the current price of ETH/BTC is about the same as it was 18 months ago when the correlation was last at this level, around 0.066 BTC per ETH. There is speculation that the price of Bitcoin could reach $28,000 if it manages to overcome the resistance at $27,000, but it is important to note that significant resistance is expected around $28,700. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) both indicate a buying zone, increasing the likelihood of an uptrend beyond $26,700. On the other hand, if Bitcoin falls below $26,000, the next support levels are expected at $25,900 or even lower, possibly as low as $25,000.” Shivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, “The crypto market remained calm over the last 24 hours with BTC within the range of $27,000. ETH, the second largest digital asset rose by close to 1 percent and is changing hands at $1,812. The crypto market sentiment looks positive but if users go for de-risking then we may see some selling pressure on BTC and other crypto assets in the coming weeks.”  CoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, “Bitcoin was trading at about $27,460, up by 2 percent over the past 24 hours with signs of resilience as it surged past the $27,000 mark. One notable indicator of potential upward momentum for the world's leading crypto asset is the decline in the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR), which has dropped approximately 11 percent in the past 11 days. The SSR is a key metric used to gauge buying pressure in the market, with lower values suggesting increased buying power. These developments bode well for Bitcoin's price trajectory, potentially pushing it higher in the near term.” Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
