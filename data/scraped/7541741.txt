With the way that global warming has shifted the weather patterns nowadays, you never know when you might need to pull out your weatherproof sneakers. And if you’re in the market for a new pair, you’re in luck because Jordan Brand is preparing to drop more Air Jordan 1 Element colorways this season. One is the “Sky J Light Olive” installment that has just surfaced by way of early imagery. Jumpman designers were not fearful to get colorful with this forthcoming entry. Its titular shade thrown onto the quarter panels and comes neighbored by a set of solid black overlays and ankle flaps. A potent “Noise Aqua” tone decorates the collars and perforated toe boxes while notes of “Bright Mandarin-Sail” poke out through the flecked laces, tongue branding and embroidered “GORE-TEX” hits, the latter of which symbolizes its rainproof capabilities. At the time of writing there are no hard details on when these will officially be releasing to the public, but you can likely see these hitting the shelves in the coming months. Peep an early look in the carousel above and note that their retail price will be set at $200 USD.
