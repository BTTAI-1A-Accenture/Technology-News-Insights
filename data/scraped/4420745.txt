NEWS While M&A activity may be down in 2023, the incoming Brown Rudnick lawyers believe the coming years will be a boon for work related to emerging companies. January 25, 2023 at 12:26 PM  4 minute read Law Firm Hiring Brown Rudnick is adding a four-lawyer corporate and M&A group from Seyfarth Shaw on Wednesday, seizing an opportunity to ramp up during a relatively slower time in the practice area for many firms.  The group is comprised of corporate partners Andrew Sherman and Rod Moss and includes counsel Karen Ramdhanie. All three joined this week, and an associate with the group will join at the end of the month. They will operate out of the firm’s Washington, D.C., office while also spending time in New York and on the West Coast as the need arises. To view this content, please continue to their sites.
