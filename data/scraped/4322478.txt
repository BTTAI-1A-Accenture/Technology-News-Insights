The Francis College of Engineering has been recognized as exemplar and with a Bronze Award for the inaugural ASEE Diversity Recognition Program. The ASEE Diversity Recognition Program (ADRP) was created to publicly recognize those engineering and engineering technology colleges that make significant, measurable progress in increasing the diversity, inclusion, and degree attainment outcomes of their programs. Mechanical engineering grad Maxwell Dumerant, who was activated by the Mass. National Guard to assist with the state’s pandemic response during his senior year, landed a job at General Dynamics Electric Boat. Abby Mastromonaco’s passion for sustainability led to a Rist Institute for Sustainability and Energy fellowship and research experience in a plastics engineering lab. Madison Reed works as a research assistant with Plastics Engineering Prof. Ramaswamy Nagarajan in the UML Fabric Discovery Center. Allyson Toppi never thought she could work in robotics. An internship at Brooks Automation changed her mind – and turned into a full-time job. The River Hawk Racing club steered Garrett Perry to UML. Now, he’s on course for a career in motor sports. Mechanical engineering Ph.D. student Connor Pozzi is working to help the country’s transition to renewable energy. Francis College of Engineering
