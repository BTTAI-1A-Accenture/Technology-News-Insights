Advertisement GameStop will replace its departing CFO Diana Saadeh-Jajeh with Daniel Moore, who will take on the roles of Principal Accounting Officer and interim Principal Financial Officer effective Aug. 11, 2023. The troubled retailer reported a $50.5 million loss in Q1 2023 and fired its then-CEO Matt Furlong in June 2023. Saadeh-Jajeh had only been on the job for a year. She was named CFO in July 2022 after the previous CFO, Michael Recupero, was reportedly pushed out for being too “hands off” as the retailer prepared for a round of layoffs as part of an aggressive turnaround effort. Furlong and Recupero, both former Amazon executives, had been brought on in June 2021. According to an 8-K form GameStop filed with the SEC, “Saadeh-Jajeh’s resignation was not because of any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company’s operations, policies or practices, including accounting principles and practices.” Moore, who joined GameStop in 2021, was most recently its VP, Corporate Global Controller. His 18 years’ experience in accounting and tax includes positions at Elevate Textiles and Roper Technologies.
