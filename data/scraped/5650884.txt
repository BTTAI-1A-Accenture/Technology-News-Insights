After a four-year hiatus, New Zealand fashion week: Kahuria returned in 2023 with a focus on local Māori talent. The five-day event, which ran from 29 August to 2 September in Auckland, marked a clear shift from previous years, with many Indigenous designers holding standalone shows and a Māori designer launching the event in a first for the New Zealand fashion week. This year’s fashion week was also the first in partnership with local tangata whenua group Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei (the ‘people of the land’ of central Auckland), who gifted the name Kahuria (which translates to ‘to put on clothes’) to the event.
