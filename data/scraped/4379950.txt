 $50 (waivable)  We chose the PNC Bank Treasury Enterprise Plan because it includes a high monthly transaction limit of 2,500 and allows businesses to deposit $50,000 in cash monthly with no additional charge. This account also has investment options for excess cash with the ability to set up an automatic sweep into a money market account for balances over a minimum you set. PNC offers two other accounts that scored well in our ranking—the Analysis Business Checking and Business Checking Plus accounts are both worth considering if your business doesn’t need the transaction volume or cash deposits our top pick offers. All three of these accounts include no ATM fees at PNC Bank ATMs, no set-up fee overdraft protection, free online banking, free bill pay and cash-back rewards through PNC Purchase Payback. Cash-back promotions change often and vary by location but may help you save on business spending. Why We Like It We like this account not just for the rewards but also because it permits businesses to deposit up to $50,000 in cash fee-free each month and has one of the highest monthly transaction limits of any bank we reviewed. If you operate a business that handles a large volume of transactions and cash every month, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better account for your needs than PNC Bank’s Treasury Enterprise Plan. What We Don’t Like On the list of things we don’t like, this account’s $50 monthly fee is at the top. And while it is waivable, the requirements to avoid it may be too high for small businesses. PNC Bank also requires some business owners to visit a branch to finish opening their accounts. Who It’s Best For PNC Treasury Enterprise Plan is best for established businesses with high deposit and transaction volumes. While PNC Bank offers mobile and digital banking, this account may be best suited for business owners who prefer banking at a branch. PNC Treasury Enterprise Plan is a non-interest-bearing account. The first 2,500 transactions (including deposits, paid items and ACH transfers) and $50,000 in cash deposits are free each month. The $50 monthly account maintenance fee can be waived by maintaining a $30,000 average monthly collected balance between the primary and all beneficiary business checking accounts. This account carries a number of incidental fees you may be charged. PNC Bank has branches in 28 states. The Treasury Enterprise Plan currently offers a $500 bonus: maintain a minimum average ledger balance of $30,000 for each of the first three statement cycles to earn a $500 bonus.. Or you can earn a $1,000 bonus when you maintain a minimum average balance of $100,000 for each of the first three statement cycles. This offer expires 9/30/2024.

 $0  We picked the First Internet Bank Do More Business™ Checking account because it earns interest and includes perks like unlimited transactions and $10 in monthly ATM reimbursements. It’s also one of the only competitive business checking accounts without a monthly fee. Why We Like It We like this account because instead of paying the best interest rate on smaller balances, as many business checking accounts do, it pays 0.50% APY for accounts with an average daily balance of $10,000 APY on accounts with an average daily balance of $10,000. What We Don’t Like We don’t like that balances below $10,000 don’t earn interest with this account. First Internet Bank also doesn’t have its own ATM network or partner with an existing network, so business owners may have trouble staying under the out-of-network reimbursement limit. Who It’s Best For The First Internet Bank Do More Business Checking account is best for mature businesses that keep larger balances in the bank and transact often, but it could also meet the needs of smaller businesses with less to deposit. Interest for this account is compounded and credited monthly on the last day of each month. The Do More Business Checking account has no minimum deposit, balance or monthly maintenance fee. Regardless of your balance, you will be reimbursed up to $10 per month in ATM fees. First Internet Bank also offers several business deposit accounts, including a savings account, money market account and CDs. The First Internet Bank Do More Business Checking account does not have active sign-up or referral bonuses at this time.

 None or 1.50% APY on balances up to $20,000 with Found Plus  
 $0  
 $0 or $19.99 monthly for Found Plus  Found Bank offers two business checking accounts that scored highly in our ranking— Found and Found Plus. Both accounts offer several innovative features to make managing a small business easier, including the ability to send trackable invoices right from the app. Found also calculates your estimated tax bill in real time and allows you to set up automatic savings so you can pay your taxes right from the app. Why We Like It We like this account because it brings modern features into banking that business owners need. Instead of toggling between spreadsheets and your bank account, you can send invoices, track expenses, manage your bookkeeping and pay your quarterly taxes all from Found’s app. What We Don’t Like Found is not well-suited for a traditional business that works with cash or a large transaction volume. While there are no limits on direct deposits, wire transfers, ACH transfers or transfers from apps like PayPal or Cash App, there are relatively low limits on everything else. Cash deposits are limited to $2,000 per week, check deposits are limited to $3,000 per week and transfers from a linked debit card are limited to $2,000 per week. You can only withdraw $550 from an ATM daily and make $5,000 in card purchases or transfers to payment apps daily. Who It’s Best For Freelancers, influencers, and small online businesses or 1099 workers looking to simplify their bookkeeping and streamline their banking will find the extensive features of Found to be useful. Found offers several bookkeeping features, including automated expense tracking, receipt capture, one-click business reports, unlimited custom invoices, 1099 contractor payment management and accountant access. Tax management features include real-time tax estimates, write-off tracking, auto-generated tax forms and auto-saving for taxes. Found Plus includes in-app quarterly tax payments and free tax filing for annual plan members. Found currently offers a $100 bonus to Care.com users who sign up and deposit $1,000 in total earnings into Found (terms apply).

 $10 (waivable)  We picked the Axos Bank Business Interest Checking account because it offers several free business services and earns competitive interest. It also comes with access to dedicated Axos Bank relationship managers. Why We Like It We like this account because it includes unlimited domestic ATM reimbursements for third-party ATMs and discounted business services with partners Celero and ADP. And, of course, it earns up to 1.01% APY on balances below $50,000. What We Don’t Like We don’t like that this account carries a $10 monthly fee and has a low remote deposit limit of 60 items per month. It also only earns the best interest rate on balances below $50,000. Who It’s Best For Axos Business Interest Checking is best for business owners open to using Axos’ service partners who plan to keep between $5,000 and $50,000 in the bank. More or less than this and you’re probably better off going with a different account.   Axos Business Interest Checking earns up to 1.01% APY on balances below $50,000, 0.20% APY on balances between $50,000 and $249,999.99 and 0.10% APY on all other balances. The account limits free remote deposits to 60 items per month and a monthly processing limit of 100, including remote deposits. This account offers a complimentary starter set of paper checks. Dedicated banking relationship managers are available Monday through Friday. This account charges fees for paper statements, checks and outgoing wire transfers. Axos also offers business savings accounts, a business money market account, a nonprofit money market account, business CDs and loans. Merchant services are provided through a partnership with Celero Merchant Solutions. Payroll services are provided through a partnership with Roll by ADP. Axos offers a cash bonus of up to $400 when opening an account and meeting certain requirements by October 31, 2024, using offer code NEW400. To qualify, you must make a deposit within 30 days of opening your new account, and your balance will be used to determine the amount of your bonus. To earn $400, which is paid as $100 for up to four statement cycles, you will need to have an average balance above $50,000 in your new account, a minimum of 10 POS transactions of at least $3 each posted to your account each month and bill pay set up for your account. You need to submit an application by October 31, 2024 to qualify. Business owners who are also interested in opening a personal checking account can qualify for a bonus of up to $700 when they open a business checking account and a high-yield Rewards Checking account at the same time. To qualify for this bonus, you will use the code AXOS700 to apply for both accounts by October 31, 2024. Then, you must meet individual bonus requirements for each account.

 $29.95 (waivable)  We picked the Bank of America Business Advantage Relationship Banking account because it offers widespread in-person access as one of the largest banks in the country and high customer satisfaction for business accounts. Why We Like It We like Bank of America because it ranks highly for merchant services satisfaction with J.D. Power and has nearly 3,800 bank branches in the U.S. What We Don’t Like We don’t like that this account has a high monthly fee and a high minimum balance requirement of at least $100 to waive it. Who It’s Best For This account is best for business owners who prefer doing their banking in person and will qualify to waive the maintenance fee every month. Consider the Bank of America Business Advantage Fundamentals™ Banking instead if you need an account with a lower monthly fee that’s easier to waive, but note that this option—which also scored highly in our analysis—carries lower free transaction and cash deposit limits and more service fees. Bank of America also offers a wide variety of additional business banking features, including savings accounts and CDs, business management tools and services, credit cards, lending and retirement solutions from Merrill Edge. When you need general customer service support, you can call Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. ET and Saturday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. For specific questions about business banking services like remote deposit or online banking, you can call additional dedicated service lines. Bank of America does not offer a bonus for the Bank of America Business Advantage Relationship Banking account, but the Bank of America Business Advantage Fundamentals™ Banking offers the following cash bonus: Earn a $200 cash bonus when you open a Bank of America Business Advantage Relationship Banking or Bank of America Business Advantage Fundamentals™ Banking by June 30, 2024, make a qualifying deposit within 30 days, then maintain a balance of at least $5,000 for the following 60 days—until the 90th day after the account was opened..

 $0  Novo has many of the common features you’d expect from a top business bank account like no monthly maintenance fee and no minimum deposit requirement. What got Novo onto our list are the features that make it well-suited for e-commerce, including integration to Stripe, Square, Gusto and Etsy. Why We Like It We like Novo for its ability to connect and automate business processes with the apps you’re already using to run your business. You can take a payment in Stripe, update inventory in sheets, and pay your employee in Gusto all while Novo integrates the data in your account. What We Don’t Like Similar to other online business accounts, Novo does not have physical locations and does have transaction limits. Unfortunately, these limits are opaque and specific to each business. Novo currently has limits on ACH transfers, check deposits, ATM withdrawals, and Point of Sale purchases, but to find out what these limits are you’ll have to open an account and find your limits in the “account info” section of the Novo App. Novo also only offers customer service through their app or by email. Who It’s Best For Novo is best suited for e-commerce businesses or small businesses that are looking for a account that offers integration with the apps they already use to manage their business. Novo is a banking platform, not a bank. Novo offers an Express ACH option for customers to get paid on the same day. However, this service comes with a charge of 1.5% of the transaction amount. Novo also offers discounts to customers on several partner products including $5k in waived Stripe processing fees, and three months free on Gusto. Novo does not currently offer a welcome bonus.

 $0  Brex isn’t a traditional business bank account, it is a cash management account offered through Brex Treasury. Brex partners with several banks to provide up to $6 million in FDIC insurance on your deposits. Or you can elect to invest your money in a money market fund that pays 4.89% as of August 9, 2024. Why We Like It We like Brex for it’s low fees — no maintenance fees, $0 wires and no account minimums. It also offers higher FDIC insurance limits and a money market investment option so your money can work for you. If you’re already a Brex customer, adding a business account can allow you to manage all of your investments and banking needs in one place. What We Don’t Like Brex doesn’t allow you to make cash deposits or ATM withdrawals from your account. This account is not well suited for a business processing a large volume of transactions. Who It’s Best For Brex is best for a business owner currently sitting on a lot of capital they want to keep FDIC insured, earning money for them or a combination of the two. Brex partners with multiple banks to offer expanded FDIC insurance on up to $6 million in deposits. Customers can choose to keep their deposits in cash or they can invest in money market fund Dreyfus Goverment Cash Management Investor Shares (DGVXX). Since Brex isn’t a bank account, you cannot deposit or withdraw cash from this account. Brex offers a sign-on bonus of 10,000 points when you spend $3,000 on your Brex card within three months of your Brex business account opening.

 $0  We chose the NBKC Bank Business Checking Account because it doesn’t have fees or minimums, making it friendly to small businesses and startups without a lot of capital. NBKC also stands out as a full-service digital bank. Why We Like It We like that this free account helps business owners save time and money. It doesn’t charge fees found with many business bank accounts or require owners to maintain a certain balance or activity level to get the most benefit. We also like that NBKC offers many business accounts, lending options and payment solutions so small businesses can grow without switching banks. What We Don’t Like Although the NBKC online platform and mobile app are user-friendly, they’re more basic than offerings from other banks and don’t have many business-specific tools for budgeting and accounting. Who It’s Best For The NBKC Bank Business Checking Account is best for smaller businesses that want to save on banking and have the flexibility to let their balances fluctuate. It’s ideal for those without complicated money management or app integration needs. NBKC Bank offers a single mobile app for both business and personal banking. The account offers surcharge-free ATM access at over 37,000 MoneyPass ATMs. Suppose you need to use an out-of-network ATM that charges a fee; NBKC refunds up to $12 per statement period. In addition to a free business checking account, NBKC Bank offers business savings deposit accounts—both money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs)—business loans and lines of credit, and business solutions including cash management, fraud management, collections and disbursement services. The NBKC Bank Business Checking Account does not have active sign-up or referral bonuses at this time.

 $14.95 (waived with average daily balance of $5,000+)  Formerly TIAA bank, EverBank is an online bank with nine branch locations in Florida. This business checking account offers a balance of features, including low fees and 200 free transactions monthly. Why We Like It We like EverBank for its simplicity. Low fees combine with a 0.55% APY on checking balances for a solid account for any business owner who needs a moderate volume of transactions processed. What We Don’t Like EverBank requires you to maintain a daily average balance of $5,000 to waive your monthly maintenance fee. This account lacks business management features common with other business accounts, like payroll integration and accountant access. Who It’s Best For EverBank is best for a small business owner who is looking for a low-fee, interest-earning account that can process up to 200 transactions monthly for free. Business Interest Checking account holders will earn 0.55% APY and benefit from up to 200 transactions for free monthly. The minimum deposit to open an account is $1,500 and the monthly maintenance fee is only waived with an average daily balance of $5,000. EverBank does not currently offer a welcome bonus.

 $35 waived with $25,000 minimum balance We picked Capital One Enhanced Checking because it offers a strong combination of benefits and accessibility. Notably, you won’t pay anything for incoming or outgoing domestic wire transfers, which is rare among business bank accounts. You’ll also have free access to a massive ATM network and branch locations across the country. Why We Like It We like that this account offers unlimited free incoming domestic wire transfers and five free outgoing wire transfers each month. We also like that Capital One gives you the option to open two Business Basic checking accounts to meet your business’s needs. Plus, you can access your account for free at more than 70,000 Allpoint, MoneyPass and Capital One ATMs across the country. What We Don’t Like We don’t like that you’ll need to keep at least $25,000 in your account to dodge the $35 monthly fee associated with this account. Also, we don’t like that Capital One still charges $35 for overdrafts and nonsufficient funds (NSF) fees. Many other banks have lowered or eliminated these fees. Who It’s Best For This account is best for businesses that regularly need to send or receive domestic wire transfers. It’s also good for business owners wanting a full-service bank with nationwide access to branches and ATMs. Avoid the $35 monthly service fee by maintaining a $25,000 minimum 30- or 90-day average monthly ledger account balance. Account holders can open up to two Capital One Business Basic Checking accounts with no monthly service fee if the Capital One Business Enhanced Checking is open and in good standing. Free overdraft protection is available with a linked Capital One Business deposit account. Capital One does not currently offer any bonuses associated with the Enhanced Checking account.

 To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed 226 business checking accounts at 79 financial institutions, including a mix of traditional brick-and-mortar banks and online banks. We ranked each account on data points within the categories of fees, minimum requirements, customer experience, digital experience, limits, features, APY and access.

A business checking account is a lot like a personal checking account. With both types of accounts, you’re typically able to make deposits and withdrawals, process ACH payments, write checks and use a debit card to make purchases and use ATMs. The big difference, of course, is that a business checking account holds money for your business, while a personal checking account holds money for personal expenses like mortgage payments, car payments and utility bills. Another key difference: Business bank accounts tend to charge more fees than personal checking accounts do. Business checking accounts are designed for all types of businesses. Limited liability companies (LLCs), sole proprietors, corporations and partnerships can all open business checking accounts. A business as small as a one-person consulting firm or as large as a 10,000-employee software company can set up a business checking account.

Among the many challenges facing small business owners, one of the most important is choosing the right business banking relationship—whether that means online, in a branch or somewhere in between. A business checking account can provide a solid foundation for building a business by helping to: Since many of the best business checking accounts featured above are free, there’s no reason not to open one for your business, especially as having a strong relationship with a bank could result in access to a business credit card or business line of credit if needed in the future. Related: 7 Top Features of a Business Checking Account A business checking account provides the foundation of your business banking relationship. One of its most important functions is to separate your business banking from your personal banking. Here are several things to consider as you’re choosing the right business checking account: There’s no one-size-fits-all answer here. Choosing the best business checking account for your small business is a personal decision based on your business’s needs and your own habits and wants. Once you’ve decided which business checking account to open, you can visit the financial institution’s website, go to a local branch or call customer support to set up the account. Keep in mind that online-only banks will usually steer you toward opening a business checking account through their websites. Aside from your business’s IRS-issued employer identification number (EIN)—or your Social Security number if you’re a sole proprietor—you’ll probably need to supply the following (although requirements differ depending on the type of business): You can open many business checking accounts online without ever visiting a branch. After you’ve decided which bank or credit union you want to work with and which account is best for your business, you can submit an online application and provide the required personal and business information. You’ll then make your initial deposit, which will mean linking an external account if opening with a new bank. Most banks don’t require a credit check to open a business checking account. That means even if you have bad credit, you should still be able to get a business checking account. If you’re unsure where you fall on the credit spectrum, here are the credit score ranges according to FICO: Though banks may not check your credit as part of the business checking account application, they may pull your ChexSystems report to see how you’ve managed bank accounts in the past. A ChexSystems report is a record of your banking history and helps financial institutions assess your risk as a potential bank account holder. ChexSystems collects the following information: To avoid any potential account opening delays, request a copy of your ChexSystems report and ensure all information is correct. If you spot a mistake, you can file a dispute to ChexSystems to get it fixed before opening a business checking account. Keep in mind that documentation may be required when filing a dispute. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you’re entitled to a free copy of your ChexSystems once every twelve months. High-yield business checking accounts are worth considering if you want to earn interest on your balance without opening a separate savings account. If you tend to keep a high balance in your checking account, you may find high-yield business checking accounts particularly valuable. As the name suggests, a high-yield business checking account usually offers a higher APY than a standard business checking account. Remember to review the account terms carefully, as some high-yield business checking accounts require you to meet certain activity and balance requirements to receive the advertised APY. Related: How Can A Business Bank Account Help Your Small Business Grow? Depending on your business needs and goals, business checking accounts may not be the right choice for you. Here are some alternatives to consider. Business checking accounts are primarily used for everyday business transactions, including deposits, withdrawals and payments. On the other hand, business savings accounts are typically used for specific savings goals, such as taxes, emergencies and employee benefits. A business savings account can help you organize your money and reach your business goals. It may also help your money grow faster—business savings accounts generally have higher APYs than business checking accounts. Business savings accounts don’t usually come with debit cards because they’re meant for savings versus everyday transactions. However, in some instances, business savings accounts may come with an ATM card you can use to withdraw funds but not make purchases. Business checking accounts and personal checking accounts function similarly, except one is designed for businesses, and the other is meant for individuals. A business checking account helps you organize your business finances and may come with business tools, while a personal checking is used for your personal income and expenses. Business checking accounts serve the important purpose of helping you separate your personal and business finances. A business checking account can make it easier to track your income and expenses, file taxes and build legitimacy as a new business. Having your business’s revenue and expenses clearly separated into a business bank account may also help you qualify for business loans. Offer  Earn up to $300*

With a business checking account, you likely will be handling a wider variety of transactions and the quality of your record-keeping matters more. The right number of business checking accounts for you depends on how you prefer to manage your business income and expenses. It may be a good idea to have at least one business checking account to deposit payments and pay expenses and a separate account to hold cash reserves.

Many of the financial institutions that offer free business checking are online-only banks that aren’t household names in banking. Some online-only banks that offer free business checking accounts include Axos, BlueVine, Grasshopper, Lili and Novo. Yes.
