AI, or artificial intelligence, is technology that attempts to simulate human cognitive function. AI has made its way into the software development space in a number of ways.

Failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures. Read about the latest observability content here Learn More In the past, the CI/CD pipeline was simply a place to integrate code. Developers would write their code in GitHub, pass it through the pipeline, and then deploy it. The pipeline has become a much more critical piece of the software delivery lifecycle today. Learn More Modern cloud-native applications, often leverage microservices, containers, APIs, infrastructure-as-code and more to enable speed in app development and deployment Learn More Sponsored By: Always On, Always Fast Deploy Distributed PostgreSQL in just 90 Seconds Learn More  The Importance of Security Testing With more development teams today using open-source and third-party components to build out their applications, the biggest area of concern for security teams has become the API. This is where vulnerabilities are likely to arise, as keeping on top of updating those interfaces has lagged. Read the Guide Here Mobile App Testing involves analyzing mobile apps for functionality, usability, visual appeal, and consistency across multiple mobile devices. It helps ensure an optimal user experience, irrespective of the device used to access the app. Learn More Today’s distributed software environments incorporate a variety of APIs with every interface your software touches, from mobile to microservices. Each API has to be continuously tested and verified to ensure your software functions as it should. Parasoft’s API testing platform makes quick, efficient, and intelligent work of such requirements. Learn More Ensure your application’s resilience, and make sure your software performs as expected under diverse operating conditions. (sponsored by Parasoft) Learn More    DevSecOps is the DevOps community’s approach to bringing security into the development lifecycle. Businesses want to deliver software, but cannot afford to release unreliable or insecure applications— therefore security needs to be baked in much sooner than it has traditionally been. Learn More Securing an application is just as important as building it in the first place. As data becomes more valuable, there are more people who want to steal it and use it for their own personal gain. Making sure applications are indeed secure has always been a challenge, as hackers try to stay one step ahead of defenders. Learn More Secrets are essential for integrating your infrastructure with databases and SaaS services. Doppler‘s developer-first security platform empowers teams to manage, orchestrate, and govern secrets across any environment. In 2023, there was an 18% decline in the number of open-source projects that are considered to be “actively maintained.” This is according to Sonatype’s Annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report. Learn More Development Managers need a different type of content than developers… They need to know what platforms, tools, trends, and issues they should be thinking about. SD Times delivers those unique topics here Learn More Agile software development has been around since the 1990s, but didn’t get the name until the famous meeting of 17 renowned software development thought leaders at Snowbird, Utah resulted in an Agile Manifesto. The idea behind Agile software development is to reduce time to market by enabling faster iterations of smaller segments of software. Learn More Value stream management involves people in the organization to examine workflows and other processes to ensure they are deriving the maximum value from their efforts while eliminating waste — of resources, time and assets. It is the practice that truly brings the business side and IT side together as partners in creating value for the organization. Learn More Learn More DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. Learn More Gravitee helps organizations manage and secure their entire API lifecycle with solutions for API design, management, security, productization, real-time observability, and more.

Learn More NVIDIA is doubling down on AI, and generative AI in particular, with CEO Jensen Huang placing a big emphasis on the advancements in the company during his keynote address during GTC this week.  “The warp drive engine is accelerated computing, and the energy source is AI,” Huang said. “The impressive capabilities of generative AI have created a sense of urgency for companies to reimagine their products and business models.” During the event he described the areas the company has made strides in. Here are some of the highlights from the events:  The new service will enable companies to build AI applications and services. The new services NeMo and Picasso are part of AI Foundations, with NeMo being a large language model (LLM) and Picasso for images, video, and 3D.  NeMo enables companies to refine their LLMs by defining areas of focus, adding domain-specific knowledge, and teaching functional skills.  Picasso can be used to build and deploy generative AI-based image, video, and 3D. Companies can use it to include text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-to-3D capabilities.  Already the company has partnerships in place taking advantage of these new solutions, including Adobe, Getty Images, and Shutterstock. These collaborations will help advance productivity for creatives using AI.  There are four new inference platforms for building AI-powered applications. The inference platforms are combined with the power of the latest NVIDIA Ada, Hopper, and Grace Hopper processors.  They include NVIDIA L4 for AI Video, NVIDIA L40 for Image Generation, NVIDIA H100 NVL for Large Language Model Deployment, and NVIDIA Grace Hopper for Recommendation Models “The rise of generative AI is requiring more powerful inference computing platforms,” said Huang. “The number of applications for generative AI is infinite, limited only by human imagination. Arming developers with the most powerful and flexible inference computing platform will accelerate the creation of new services that will improve our lives in ways not yet imaginable.” The range of offerings from these companies will help support organizations in optimizing their AI workflows.  The AI companies that NVIDIA has partnered with include Canonical, ClearML, Dataiku, Domino Data Lab, Run,ai, and Weights & Biases. The company also partnered with the major cloud providers, which can provide infrastructure for data processing, wrangling, training, and inference. These include AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud. The company launched DGX Cloud, which enables access to an AI supercomputer right from a web browser. This removes the need to acquire, deploy, and manage on-premises infrastructure. Companies can rent DGX Cloud clusters based on their current needs and easily scale as needs change.  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is the first to provide hosting for DGX Cloud infrastructure, and according to NVIDIA, Microsoft Azure will offer hosting next quarter. Plans for Google Cloud and other providers are also in the works.  Through the Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) platform a new feature will make it easier to develop interactive avatars, from interactive chatbots to intelligent digital humans.  For example, AT&T is using Omniverse ACE to create and deploy virtual assistants for its employee help desk. It is also working with one of NVIDIA’s service delivery partners Quantiphi to provide support for local languages in different regions.  “Quantiphi and NVIDIA have been collaborating to make customer experience more immersive by combining the power of large language models, graphics and recommender systems,” said Siddharth Kotwal, global head of NVIDIA Practice at Quantiphi. “NVIDIA’s Tokkio framework has made it easier to build, deploy and personalize AI-powered digital assistants or avatars for our enterprise customers. The process of seamlessly integrating automatic speech recognition, conversational agents and information retrieval systems with real-time animation has been simplified.”
