(Photo by Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post) Fueled by a pair of senior captains who will now have five championship rings, Cheyenne Mountain put an exclamation point on its lacrosse dynasty Monday at Peter Barton Stadium.Cheyenne Mountain beat Erie, 10-9, in double-overtime for its third straight Class 4A title and fourth overall in the program’s fifth consecutive championship appearance.Senior attack Wyatt Furda had a hat trick, while senior goalie Matty Kelleher held off Erie’s high-powered attack in OT. Both players were also captains on the Red-Tailed Hawks hockey teams that repeated as 4A champions over the past two winters — Furda a forward and Kelleher a defenseman.“We cemented (the dynasty) tonight,” said Furda, a Colorado College lacrosse commit.Junior attack Logan Mika put home the game-winner with 55 seconds left in the second OT after Erie stormed back from a five-goal deficit at halftime and had the Red-Tailed Hawks on the ropes down the stretch.“The past few years, it’s been us and Erie at the top of 4A, so we knew it was going to be a great game and we knew they were going to have an answer in the second half,” Furda said. “It was our job to respond. They punched us a bunch of times, but good teams respond, and that’s what we did.“In net, Matty’s a superstar — an amazing first half and then two saves in overtime, both on kids who are going Division I. He stood his ground.”Mika’s golden goal came off a deflection; he got the rebound right in front of the net and put in the winner on a bouncing shot through the bottom shelf.

“That was a feeling that truly just took the breath out of me,” Mika said. “When I got the ball, it was like I blacked out. I knew I needed to get it off quick because the entire Erie defense was closing in. I went for the back-hand shot, and once I saw the net flicker, it was an unbelievable feeling.”The Red-Tailed Hawks’ four titles are now tied with Arapahoe and Regis Jesuit for the third-most in CHSAA boys lacrosse history behind Kent Denver (five) and Cherry Creek (seven).Cheyenne Mountain dominated the first half behind two goals from Furda and a brick wall performance by Kelleher, a Quinnipiac University commit. The Red-Tailed Hawks also controlled tempo, physicality and time of possession.Related Articles
