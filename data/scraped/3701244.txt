Radical queer activist group Queer Endurance / Defiance
is calling on the whole queer community and allies to gather
on Parliament lawn at 2pm on 1 July to commemorate the
Stonewall riots that helped fuel the flame of the modern
queer rights movement. QED will be taking this opportunity
to launch their campaign for decent transgender healthcare
in Aotearoa. QED has eighteen specific demands for
trangender healthcare reform, and a government who supported
and addressed these demands would be taking a significant
step towards ensuring greater equitability in Aotearoa’s
healthcare system.Thousands rallied in support of
irawhiti and trans rights in Civic Square in March, in
possibly the biggest trans rights protest in Aotearoa's
history. Now Queer Endurance / Defiance seeks to build on
that energy, to move beyond simply opposing transphobia, to
creating a coalition for our rights.In particular,
Queer Endurance / Defiance aims to put irawhiti and trans
healthcare on the political agenda in an election year.
There are hundreds on waiting lists for gender-affirming
care, with some on a waitlist of over ten years. “The
inadequate resourcing of and pathways for irawhiti and
transgender healthcare is in part due to an overstretched
underfunded healthcare system that affects everybody” says
Serah Allison, a spokesperson for QED. “Importantly, the
healthcare system’s failings disproportionately affect
irawhiti and transgender people, and that inequity is a
denial of their healthcare rights.” QED is fighting for an
informed consent model for our healthcare, simplifying the
many hoops we currently need to jump through for life-saving
care.



We believe only mass action can ensure irawhiti
and trans rights, and that liberation for gender diverse
people is bound up with the liberation of oppressed and
exploited people generally. Tristan Cordelia, a spokesperson
for QED, says: “We know that decent healthcare for our
community won’t come without an improved health system for
all; that we will achieve our health aims not by diverting
funds from the current level of total healthcare funding,
but by increasing the pot for all. We therefore seek to
build the broadest possible working-class solidarity. We
appreciate all who stand with
us.”

 The ACT Party won only 8.6% of the vote last year, so how come it seems to be driving about 75% of the government’s agenda? It helps ACT’s cause that Christopher Luxon is so incompetent, and such a pushover. Earlier this week, Luxon just couldn’t keep in his head the sales pitch he’d been given for a crackdown that was comprised almost entirely of ACT social welfare policies. Water Safety New Zealand emphasises that the safety of all on board is ultimately the responsibility of the skipper.  57,006 live births registered, down from 57,534. 37,500 deaths registered, down from 38,346. Doing nothing and hoping for more fossil gas to be found is not a responsible strategy; acting now to reduce the need for fossil gas is the answer. The research identifies five areas most vulnerable to corrupt practices: the practice of political lobbying; political donations and elections funding; access to official information; foreign bribery; and beneficial ownership of corporate entities. Whatever Happened To Our Bespoke Plan? CRAC is calling on all city councillors to resist pressure to accept entirely the recommendations of the Independent Hearings Panel (IHP) on Plan Change 14 (Housing Intensification), to help ensure this controversial plan change is the best it can be for our city. The project included a review of safeguarding policies and procedures, as well as dozens of face to-face and online interviews. A team of consultants met with survivors and survivor advocates, Church leaders, safeguarding officers, academics and parishioners to understand the current practice.
