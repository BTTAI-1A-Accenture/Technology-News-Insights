Image: ShutterstockAccording to the official forum page of MakerDAO, the decentralised autonomous organisation responsible for governing the DAI stablecoin, a new proposed "constitution" has been approved. The purpose of this constitution is to establish formal governance processes and prevent hostile individuals from taking control of the protocol.
								 
								The proposal for a MakerDAO constitution states that such a document is necessary because the Maker Protocol relies on human and institutional decisions involving MKR tokens, which could lead to weaknesses and vulnerabilities that could result in the loss of user funds or the failure of the protocol. To prevent this, the constitution aims to use "alignment engineering" to establish and secure the core commitments of the Maker community. Most exciting travel destinations for 2024
