 Colleagues,  During Scripps’ long and successful 145-year history, the citizens of our nation have depended on us to inform, engage and entertain them. And while I believe that we mostly get it right, companies like ours that play prominent roles in the daily lives of Americans must have the humility of self-reflection, and most importantly, a strong resolve to do something about what we see in that mirror. This “On My Mind” is one such occasion. Americans today have more choices than ever for how they spend time and where they consume content. And yet paradoxically, I’d also argue there are fewer options for quality, objective journalism, especially in local news. Fewer options, because there are fewer companies committed to the cause.  If we are to believe audience data and research (and I do), a growing number of people think we’re not relevant enough. A portion of our audience doesn’t see themselves reflected appropriately in our coverage; a different segment feels we’ve taken a side; another group thinks we’ve taken the opposite side. Trust in professional journalism is at an all-time low. At the intersection of more media options and fewer committed news companies sits a significant opportunity for Scripps and our mission-driven employees. During our last strategic planning period, your senior leadership team confirmed our commitment to journalism with this objective: Expand our role in American journalism by providing fact-based news coverage with deeper context. Our belief in this objective led us to the consolidation of our national news resources and the creation of Scripps News. And next, we’ll undertake our most ambitious effort yet: to reinvent and reinvest in our local news in order to ensure this company, committed to perpetuation, will be in service to the American people for the next 145 years and beyond.   How did our industry get here? In the 1980s (yes, that far back), the use of technology began to overtake journalistic substance as a factor that could differentiate local TV news from local newspapers. With our news-copters and fleets of microwave and satellite trucks, we could be live practically anywhere and everywhere at any time. These resources cost a lot of money, so local TV news executives knew to use them for everything, even when it didn’t add anything to the story but the illusion of urgency. In many cases, our industry still operates this way today.  Over the years, committed reporters, anchors and photojournalists have had to subjugate their ambitions to meet the demands of the industry’s growing theatrics-over-journalism priority. Resume reels from when I made my first tape in 1994 haven’t changed at all, except they’re no longer on “reels” of anything. Sadly, we mostly evaluate our journalists by watching the first few minutes of a reel: live shot, standup, live shot, live shot, look live, anchor intro … perhaps followed by a few packages. We’ve become accustomed to evaluating performance over reporting, interviewing skills and writing – the chops that are absolutely necessary to serve our communities. In addition to the demands of being live all the time, we’ve pressed our field crews to bear additional responsibility for our brands on digital platforms. A multimedia journalist (MMJ) may be live at noon, write a digital version afterward and then be assigned a new piece to report, write, shoot and edit before being live again at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. This commitment to multiple platforms is important but has certainly also contributed to the dilution of our television product and the burnout of those in the field.  As an industry, while we’ve expected more, the compensation for our journalists hasn’t kept up. In fact, “MMJ,” while once a descriptor for an evolved reporting role that could care for every element of the package, has now become synonymous with a lesser title, likely with a lower compensation opportunity. The reality is that every MMJ and reporter does need to be able to manage each part of the package, but not at the expense of the actual reporting. When audiences were large and the competition over them fierce, local broadcast companies relied on consultants who further focused attention on performance over substance. Consultants traveled from group to group, station to station, proffering the same playbook. Stations across the country became homogenized with brands, taglines, looks and tactics that initially seemed to pop with the audience but have ultimately come to mean nothing to the communities they serve.  What will we do to fix this? To be clear, mea culpa. While I have always been proud of the commitment I make to journalism, I have certainly been a part of this machine, complicit in my own way with where we are today. But enough is enough, and it’s time to move our craft forward. Together, we will take action to evolve local journalism, providing our communities with what they’ve told us they really need and want.  As we move through the reorganization, we are aiming to place the company in the best position possible to perpetuate and grow. One way we're working toward this goal is to embark on a bold new effort to reprioritize news and information over the performative aspect of local broadcasts – to put greater emphasis, resources and focus on what we do to connect with and engage our audiences. Through our four-point plan, we will:  Through this news initiative, we will add about 250 on-the-ground resources to our local reporting teams and invest nearly $10 million to increase compensation where needed to ensure we can attract and retain the best journalists. We are able to make these investments, in part, through technologies that allow us to shift from production resources to more reporters and news-gathering employees.   Tied directly to this work will be a deeper integration of the Scripps News brand and journalism into our local products. While each of our stations will continue to operate as local newsrooms with local brands and network affiliations, they will feel like Scripps News stations. The deployment of our national news operation in support of our local mission will allow for a sharper focus on the reporting and stories that serve our communities and make the markets where we operate better places to live. What I am describing is a big shift from the way we operate today and from what many of us were taught about broadcast news. It will upend more than 40 years of the industry expectation to emphasize the performative over informative. I understand the complexity. Not only will we need to change behaviors and processes, but we will have to overcome emotional attachments to the old ways. Over the coming months, you will hear a lot more about the “what, when and how.” Before we get into those details, however, I felt strongly that you should hear the “why” directly from me. I’m excited about the opportunity we have in front of us and hope you’ll be encouraged by our dedication to the mission.   Adam Symson (he/him)  President and CEO  Developer, General Contractor - Walls Properties, L.L.C.

Sounds like you’re on the right path. Much success! Senior Lecturer Emeritus, University of Georgia; President, Media Strategies and Tactics Inc A very thoughtful and very accurate analysis of today’s news environment. I look forward to finding out more about the “what, when and how.” And even more discussion of the “why.” I will be sharing this with my friends, colleagues and former students.

For now, I see Scripps is hiring “MMJs” in the #3 market. That’s a live post now. That doesn’t seem in keeping with the direction you wrote about. 
You’re talking to journalists, so I’m sure you expect that some will notice that there are words, and then there are actions. I hope you succeed, because the democracy needs that. Please put a timeline on the outline you set out and keep us posted on progress on it. Actor | Writer | Commercial Video Producer Reimagining local news means putting more emphasis on digital and streaming news. The younger generations of news viewers have no need or desire to wait until 6 pm (or any other particular time) to learn about what happened in their community. They can simply look at their phone and get the news and information they want.

It’s not like this shift happened overnight. The Internet, as we know it, has been around for three decades. Broadcasters treated the Internet as an afterthought until it became too late to effectively monetize it. Today, they still put an emphasis on traditional linear television because their revenue is tied to it — advertising and retransmission fees. For example, in 2022, Scripps Local Media made $655 million in distribution revenue and $626 million in advertising revenue (excluding the $198 million from political ads).

I’m not saying it’s time to abandon broadcast altogether, but it’s long overdue for broadcasters to get their heads out of the sand and put a bigger emphasis on digital and streaming news. That is the future of journalism. That is how younger generations choose to get their news and information. Having the best journalism doesn’t matter if people aren’t watching it.
