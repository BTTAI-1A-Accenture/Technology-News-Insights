A sizable amount of cryptocurrency that came from investment scams recently got seized by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ said Monday the estimated value of the virtual currency it had seized amounted to $112 million. The funds had been in six accounts purportedly controlled by scammers and used in connection to cryptocurrency confidence scams for laundering purposes, according to a press release. District judges in Arizona, central California and Idaho gave the go-ahead for the seizures. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REVEALS MASSIVE $3.36B CRYPTO SEIZURE The agency said scammers obtained virtual currency by tricking victims into investing in fake crypto trading platforms after having connected online and becoming close to them. Such schemes are referred to as "Sha Zhu Pan" or "pig butchering," according to the DOJ. The DOJ said Monday the estimated value of the cryptocurrency it seized amounted to $112 million.

That, according to the press release, serves as a way for the perpetrators to obtain more funds by requiring "additional investments, taxes, or fees" for the victim to supposedly be re-granted access. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has said some red flags to be aware of in connection to "pig butchering" scams include "unsolicited messages from unknown contacts," online acquaintances seeking personal financial information, investment solicitations by virtual people for "specific financial products" and "guaranteed" large returns.

They should also be cautious about downloading or using "suspicious-looking" investing apps, the FBI said.
