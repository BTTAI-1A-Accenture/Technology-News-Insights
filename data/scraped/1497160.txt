     Safety in New Smyrna Beach has been top of mind for those who live and work there after last year's chaotic spring break, and police are hoping this time around to be a step ahead of the massive crowds. (Fox 35) As college students across the U.S. flock to warmer weather in Florida for spring break, authorities across the Sunshine State are preparing for the influx by announcing new rules, curfews, and additional police. During the pandemic in 2021 and 2022, students migrated to Florida to enjoy the relatively relaxed COVID-19 policies, cheap flights and hotels. These factors created a perfect storm and created a nightmare for law enforcement personnel in beach towns along the state's coast.

In addition to the 11 p.m., curfew for teens 17 and younger, this spring break, residents and business owners can expect a stronger police presence.  Feldman announced Tuesday a command post will be parked at the beach lot on Flagler, equipped with cameras to keep an eye on the shore and down the avenue. Nearby business owners will have a direct line to it to report any concerns.  There will also be officers from different departments across Volusia County parked at the beach and at every intersection on Flagler.  Hoping to avoid a repeat of last year, those who work and live in the area are thankful for these much-needed improvements.  "What they didn't do last year was they didn't get ahead of things because they didn't know it's gonna happen," Seahorse Inn co-owner Terry Stephens shared with Fox 35.
