INFORM provides software services which help to operate and manage the  entire Ground Service Equipment (GSE) fleet of HiSERV, one of the leading GSE  service providers in Europe.  This  collaboration will also provide dashboards for HiSERV’s customers that display  the KPIs for their fleets. Cloud-ready, the solution will be provided as  Software as a Service. The contract was signed by INFORM’s Senior Vice  President, Aviation Division, Uschi Schulte-Sasse and HiSERV’s Chief Executive  Officer Roland Ückert. INFORM, a global aviation software solutions provider based in Aachen,  Germany, leverages AI-driven digital decision support capabilities to empower  aviation businesses. HiSERV (Berlin, Germany) is one of the leading providers  of GSE services in Europe credited with revolutionizing the GSE market with its  high-quality service and flexibility. In cooperation with  INFORM, HiSERV offers SmartFLEET, which leverages on-board units that collect  information and telemetry data including position of the unit on the apron,  fill levels, operating tours, usage data, and alarm messages to maximize the  efficiency of GSE assets. Customers can access reports and dashboards to  perform analysis and to check key performance indicators (KPIs). The analysis  can drill down to the level of a single GSE unit to check maintenance  procedures, degree of utilization and CO2 emissions. In addition to  metrics and analytics, SmartFLEET technology allows HiSERV to offer consulting  services, pay-per-use offerings, and the ability to pool and share GSE  resources across various users in the airport environment. The partnership contract was signed by INFORM’s Uschi Schulte-Sasse, senior vice president, Aviation Division and HiSERV’s chief executive officer  Roland Ückert.  Schulte-Sasse stated, “The unique combination of HiSERV’s ground  fleet and network and INFORM’s powerful, AI-driven optimization technology,  allows customers to achieve cost-saving efficiencies while improving  operational excellence.  With this  specific use case, HiSERV’s clients benefit from dashboards, reports and  consulting services based on advanced technologies that can help them deliver  exceptional value to their customers.” Ückert emphasized that SmartFLEET is not merely a system or a  solution; it goes beyond that.  “In conjunction with our consulting services, we  can assist our customers and partners in optimizing their entire GSE fleet. The  holistic approach is straightforward: 'track your GSE units, gain insights  through transparency, and manage your GSE fleet accordingly.' This ultimately  leads to cost reduction and enhances GSE efficiency and availability. Moreover,  predictive maintenance information enhances the safety levels of GSE, while  also reducing ground handling delays caused by GSE, benefiting overall aircraft  handling. We are delighted to have developed SmartFLEET in collaboration with  INFORM and will continually expand it to meet customer needs and requirements,” Ückert said.                                         HiSERV aims to include all its owned and  operated GSE, both motorized and non-motorized within the Smart system,  providing customers with the best information and functionalities available.  This service includes the provision of reports and analyses that facilitate  optimal performance. As the result of the HiSERV-INFORM partnership, SmartFLEET  empowers excellent ground handling operation of customers all over the world.
