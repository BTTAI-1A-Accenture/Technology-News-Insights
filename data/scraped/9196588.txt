Innovation in Focus: STMicroelectronics Highlights Industrial Advancements at ITAP 2023 (IN BRIEF) STMicroelectronics, a global semiconductor leader, will showcase innovative industrial solutions at Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific (ITAP 2023) from October 18-20. Their exhibit will feature Factory Automation with IO-Link technology, wireless connectivity, STM32 microcontrollers for industrial use, and predictive maintenance and power management solutions. Highlights include IO-Link technology for efficient factory automation, STM32WL wireless system-on-chip for resource management, and STM32G4 motor-control kits for industrial applications. Additionally, STMicroelectronics will participate in a panel discussion on smart factory development during the event. (PRESS RELEASE) GENEVA, 16-Oct-2023 — /EuropaWire/ — STMicroelectronics N.V. (Euronext: STM, NYSE: STM, BIT: STM), the largest European semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, is set to exhibit at Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific (ITAP 2023, Booth 2A23) from October 18-20. The company will present a diverse range of innovative solutions for various industrial applications, emphasizing Factory Automation with IO-Link technology, wireless connectivity, connected security, STM32 microcontrollers for industrial use, and the latest in predictive maintenance and power management. Factory Automation with IO-Link: ST’s exhibit will feature an IO-Link automated product line, showcasing the application of IO-Link technology in smart factories. This technology efficiently manages digital input/output, sensors, and solenoid air valve drivers. Modules in the demonstration include Digital IO boards, sensor boards, and actuator boards, exemplifying ST’s Automation Competence Center’s reference demo boards. Factory automation with IO-Link is demonstrated to significantly enhance production efficiency while conserving energy. Wireless Connectivity: ST will highlight its unique STM32WL long-range sub-GHz wireless system-on-chip (SoC) series, designed for diverse mass-market applications, including smart resource management. A noteworthy demo features a water-meter solution by Sindcon IoT Technology Pte Ltd., a smart meter provider in Singapore. This project incorporates STM32WLE5 LoRaWAN® wireless microcontrollers into Sindcon’s network of over 50,000 water, gas, and energy meters in Jakarta, Indonesia, enabling remote meter reading even in challenging urban and forested terrains. The STM32WLE5’s advanced battery management system ensures accurate remote readings for up to a decade. STM32 for Industrial Applications: ST presents the STM32G4 motor-control kit, a platform for designing and evaluating 3-phase low-voltage DC brushless motor solutions. The platform firmware library includes examples for sensor-less and sensor-based motor control, as well as support for field-oriented control (FOC) and sinusoidal PWM. Predictive Maintenance & Power Management: An exhibition of fully protected USB Power Delivery with STM32+TCPP (Type-C Port Protection) showcases various USB-C PD use cases, such as computer peripherals and gaming equipment, using dedicated NUCLEO and X-NUCLEO boards. The demo displays the negotiation of Power Delivery Object (PDO) as a sink with the X-NUCLEO-SNK1M1 board and demonstrates PDO switching power roles as a sink or source with the X-NUCLEO-DRP1M1 board. Additionally, with the X-NUCLEO-SRC1M1, it illustrates device charging through PDO negotiation. STMicroelectronics is also actively participating in the Industrial Transformation Forum alongside other industry leaders, focusing on the development of smart factories, key challenges, and critical success factors in building these advanced manufacturing facilities.
