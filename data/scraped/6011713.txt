					Home for America's Passionate Soccer Fans				  Inter Miami coach Tata Martino played down injury concerns over Lionel Messi on Monday as the resurgent MLS club prepared for a Leagues Cup semifinal clash at the Philadelphia Union.



 Messi appeared to tweak his right ankle during a practice session in Fort Lauderdale early on Monday, according to multiple U.S. reports.



 Martino, however, later said there was no cause for concern over Messi’s fitness.


 “I didn’t see exactly what happened but I imagine that if it had been something serious, the players would all be shocked and since they were all fine, I think nothing happened,” Martino said.

 Less than a month into his career with Miami, Messi can help the club into its first final with a victory over Philadelphia on Tuesday.



 Messi has scored eight goals in five appearances for Miami since making his debut for the club on July 21.



 Inter Miami is unbeaten since Messi’s debut, and has marched into the semifinals of the Leagues Cup. It will be facing the Union, one of the strongest sides in Major League Soccer.

The Union is third in the Eastern Conference standings — Miami is bottom — and finished runner-up to LAFC in last year’s MLS championship game.



 “They have their way, their ideas, and they were finalists in the league last year,” Martino said. “We understand that the local team will make them stronger, but we also have our aspirations to reach the final.” 



 Philadelphia manager Jim Curtin, meanwhile, has urged local fans to resist the urge to sell their tickets for the game on resale markets, where prices have ranged between $300 and $1,000.



 “Please don’t sell your tickets, no matter how much money they’re offering for them — please,” Curtin said at a press conference. “We’re talking about the best player of all time coming here in the semifinal with a trophy on the line, a spot in the Champions League on the line. So it’s a big game. I know our fans are gonna show up.”

 Wouydn’t be surprised if a group players are assigned to distract the GOAT. My approach to defending against opponents who outmatched me was to prevent them from ever getting the ball. That means keying on Busquets. However, Inter has a number of talented midfielders. This season’s signing has made Inter very strong.  Clearly the intent is to make Inter the best team in North America. Just maybe the US fans will start expecting better soccer from USSF.
