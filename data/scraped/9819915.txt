         MINNEAPOLIS -- Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert will miss the team's play-in game against the Los Angeles Lakers Tuesday as punishment for throwing a punch at a teammate. Gobert swung at Kyle Anderson in a huddle at the bench during Sunday's win over the New Orleans Pelicans. He was immediately sent to the locker room and missed the rest of the game. The team says the suspension is for one game. Gobert will return for another play-in game or the first round of the playoffs.

I should not have reacted the way i did regardless of what was said. I wanna apologize to the fans, the organisation and particularly to Kyle, who is someone that i truly love and respect as a teammate. Gobert won't be the only Timberwolf missing time due to a punch.  Defensive stalwart Jaden McDaniels fractured his hand after punching a wall in frustration on Sunday. He's now in a cast and is out indefinitely, the team said.  The No. 8 Wolves play the No. 7 Lakers Tuesday night. The winner advances to the first round of the playoffs, while the loser will play another play-in game for a shot at the postseason.
