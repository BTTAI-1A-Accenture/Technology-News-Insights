Man gets suspended sentence for causing plane to divert after refusing to wear mask

See in context
 *I recently flew to Japan on United Airlines, originating in the US. Before boarding, they announced that because the plane goes to Japan, everyone has to wear a mask for the duration of the flight. When we got on, there was one guy not wearing a mask, not even around his neck. Nobody on the flight crew said anything to him. So I took mine off. One by one, basically all the white people had taken their masks off by the middle of the flight. On the way home from Japan, no such announcement was made, and basically no white people had a mask on* This tells me three things about the person who made the comment. 1.) His photo would look identical to that of the man in the story. 2.) He truly believes his comment is completely neutral and normal. 3.) What other people of color were on his flights? How many different colors? One? Two? Three? And why did those people (clearly inferior humans) keep their masks on? 4

 Glad there are still people like him in Japan who don't just inanely toe the line without any thought to their inactions. Th photo doesn't do him any favours though! That pretty much sums up every commenter with a - negative vote next to their comment. These "lone wolfs for justice! Because, "we're in that special, in the-know-group! Unlike you "sheeple" That photo of him? Look in the mirror. That's what the rest of the world sees when they look at YOU.  "In the name of (my) freedom, we defend the right to threaten, assault, attack, punch and hit, authorities, strangers!"  In any society, we call them a menace. And mentally ill. 3
