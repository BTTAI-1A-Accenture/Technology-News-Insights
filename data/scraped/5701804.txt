Emmanuel Ramos is Chief Solutions Officer at OZ Digital Consulting.   Software 2.0 is transforming the approach we take to building and using software, with neural networks and machine learning (ML) playing a crucial role. This new technology trend brings about unprecedented opportunities for scaling data-rich applications powered by artificial intelligence (AI), but what does this mean for professional tech leaders? As an executive of a technology advisory firm, I have seen firsthand the transformative impact of Software 2.0 on our clients' businesses. I'll explore this trend from all angles and examine its implications on CIOs, CTOs, CEOs and other respected industry professionals. Software 2.0 is an expression employed to designate programming that uses ML algorithms and neural networks to build autonomous systems that can study data and upgrade their operation without human input. In his seminal blog post, former Tesla director of AI Andrej Karpathy writes: "In Software 1.0, human-engineered source code...is compiled into a binary that does useful work. In Software 2.0, most often the source code comprises 1) the dataset that defines the desirable behavior and 2) the neural net architecture that gives the rough skeleton of the code, but with many details (the weights) to be filled in." An area of significant advancement is in the use of Software 2.0-based models like Open AI's ChatGPT, GitHub's Copilot, Amazon's CodeWhisperer and others as AI programming assistants. IEEE notes that "hand-coding software programs will increasingly be like hand-knitting sweaters." These generative AI programming assistants will not replace human developers, but an Ark Invest report (via Unite.AI) predicts that they could have the potential to improve their productivity tenfold by taking over the mundane and boilerplate to allow developers to focus on more difficult, higher-value tasks. Software 2.0 is a sophisticated and cutting-edge model that can aid companies in becoming more productive, proficient and competitive. By exploring how it works through neural networks, ML, the rapid scaling of applications and AI-driven applications, we can gain further insight into the potential benefits it has to offer. Software 2.0 facilitates the swift creation of applications by automating numerous elements in the development process. Neural networks are used to recognize patterns in data and make decisions based on those patterns. This allows for rapid scaling and diffusion of applications as well as AI-driven applications that can be deployed quickly with minimal manual intervention from developers. Neural networks are composed of layers of neurons that "learn" from input data through a process called backpropagation. The neural network uses this information to develop an understanding of how certain inputs will lead to specific outputs over time, allowing it to accurately predict outcomes without any human intervention or programming effort required. This makes it possible for developers to rapidly scale their applications across different platforms while still ensuring accuracy in results due to its ability to learn from existing datasets rather than having each platform require custom code written by hand. Software 2.0 allows developers to rapidly scale their applications across different platforms, while its neural networks facilitate the diffusion of applications into various markets with expediency and accuracy. Moreover, these same neural networks enable AI-driven applications that can take autonomous action without human involvementâ€”making them perfect for highly automated tasks such as customer service bots or self-driving cars where precision is paramount even in changing environments. The age of AI is upon us, and technology leaders must remain on the cutting edge when it comes to using fresh innovations and readying themselves for what's ahead with organized planning. In order to become proficient in Software 2.0, technology leaders will need to understand fundamental AL/ML concepts and gain experience in typical ML programming languages. They'll want to gain significant hands-on experience by working on AI/ML-related projects. It will be vital to stay educated on the latest advancements in the field, and leaders will want to maintain a network of experts in the field in order to continue to grow and learn with the technology. In the course of our engagements with clients, we acquired expertise in the web/mobile application space and have created "accelerators" that expedite the creation of solutions. As a means to test the tenfold developer productivity claim, we established ChatGPT3 as an AI programming assistant for anyone working on the accelerators. Our intent was to measure productivity gains based on the estimated feature development velocity without assistance compared to the actual completion time of a fully tested and validated feature. We were impressed with the results, though not quite a tenfold increase. However, they were significant enough for us to start formal research on AI programming assistants in order to make it a part of our solution development process. As tech professionals, it is imperative for us to stay abreast of Software 2.0 and its associated potential so that we can capitalize on the possibilities and mitigate any risks that may arise from its use. Software 2.0 provides an incredible chance to exploit ML and neural networks for the development of pioneering new solutions that could alter our future.
