Shiba Inu Coin News: Shiba Inu's SHIB/USD upcoming Shibarium blockchain has already landed into controversy. It is alleged that the Shiba Inu developers have copied Rinia which is a different project. The allegations have made a major impact on the recent decline of the Shiba Inu price. In the meantime, crypto whales have made their move. As per the data provided by WhaleAlert, a crypto whale moved 800 billion Shiba Inu coin from the Shiba Inu staking to an unknown wallet. This implies that the whale unstacked $8.23 million worth of SHIBs from the program amid the speculation of the Shibarium code being copied. Shiba Inu coin price fell as much as 10% over the last 24 hours. SHIB is trading at an average price of $0.000010, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume is down by 27% to stand at $374 million. However, Shiba Inu went to takeover Tron (TRX) and Litecoin (LTC) in terms of market capitalization. Shiba Inu is holding a market of $6.1 billion. Â© 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.
