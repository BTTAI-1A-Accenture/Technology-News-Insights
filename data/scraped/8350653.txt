Former Ohio State Buckeyes quarterback C.J. Stroud is a projected top-five pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, despite recent criticisms about his character. But what makes Stroud worthy of such a designation? ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky broke down Stroud's ability to work within the pocket, saying his "recognition, the ability to create space and throw an accurate ball for a touchdown" is what makes him a great passer. "C.J. Stroud is the best pure passer of the football in this draft," Orlovsky said. "But the word that comes to mind when I hear his name: rhythm. When I say rhythm, I mean in the pocket. No quarterback in the FBS threw for more touchdowns from inside the pocket than Stroud has over the last two seasons. He also led the country in total QBR from the pocket over that span, and the proof is in the tape." Though it is easy to say Stroud's receivers did a big portion of the work to get open for him — which wouldn't necessarily be untrue as Jaxon Smith-Njigba is likely going to be the third first-round pass-catcher Stroud has thrown to at Ohio State — Orlovsky gave him credit for his ability to "pull guys away from the defenders." "The pace on his throws is why he was so successful on passes to contested targets," Orlovsky said. "He was significantly better in multiple areas, led by a QBR that was double the FBS average." Stroud even said himself, running more was something he regretted not doing in college, but Orlovsky compared him to a "more athletic Jared Goff." "While Stroud is not known for his legs, he uses his mobility to escape when necessary," Orlovsky said. Be sure to stay locked into BuckeyesNow all the time! Join the BuckeyesNow community!
