 Are you ready for more character promos for the Sailor Moon Cosmos anime films? A new one arrived this week via the official Sailor Moon YouTube channel, taking the opportunity to put the spotlight on the Sailor Starlights. Check out the video featuring Sailor Star Maker (VA: Saori Hayami), Sailor Star Fighter (Marina Inoue) and Sailor Star Healer (Ayane Sakura) in the video below.  The Sailor Moon Cosmos films open with part one in Japan on June 9, followed by part two on June 30.  The movies are being made at Toei Animation and Studio Deen, with Tomoya Takahashi, who was the assistant director for Gatchaman Crowds, helming the project as the full director. The scripts were written by Kazuyuki Fudeyasu of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime. Credit for music goes to Yasuharu Takanashi, who has already worked in the franchise as the composer for Sailor Moon Crystal. As a real blast from the past, Kazuko Tadano from the original 90s Sailor Moon anime is back to work on character design. The Sailor Moon Crystal television series led to the two-parter Sailor Moon Eternal movies, which in turn leads to the upcoming two-parter Sailor Moon Cosmos movies. The Sailor Moon Eternal movies came out in 2021. The storyline for Cosmos was known as the “Sailor Moon Sailor Stars” arc in the 90s anime. Kodansha publishes the Sailor Moon manga by Naoko Takeuchi in English and gave this description for the first volume: “Usagi Tsukino is a normal girl until she meets up with Luna, a talking cat, who tells her that she is Sailor Moon. As Sailor Moon, Usagi must fight evils and enforce justice, in the name of the Moon and the mysterious Moon Princess. She meets other girls destined to be Sailor Senshi (Sailor Scouts), and together, they fight the forces of evil!” Via Comic Natalie
