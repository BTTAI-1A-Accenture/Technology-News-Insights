Android Headlines / Tech News / VR News / Meta Quest+ is like PlayStation Plus for VR games Meta today announced a new service for its Quest headset lineup called Meta Quest+, a subscription service that is designed to get new games into your hands for a recurring monthly fee. It’s sort of like PlayStation Plus, but without the discounts on games. Although perhaps that will be added at a later date. If you’re big into VR though and you own either a Quest 2 or Quest Pro, signing up gives you a nifty benefit. The service will also be available for the Quest 3 when it launches later this year. If you’re member, Meta will give you two games for free every month. You claim these just like you would with PlayStation Plus titles. Meta also says games will be handpicked. So you’re getting a curated selection of titles that rotate on a monthly basis. It’ll cost you $7.99 a month, or you can pony up $59.99 for the annual subscription. The service is live starting from today and you can already claim your first two titles. These include Pistol Whip and Pixel Ripped 1995. If you’ve not tried either of these games yet, now is probably a good time to check them out. Meta has also laid out its two curated games for August. Starting August 1, subscribers can claim Mighty Coconut’s Walkabout Mini Golf and MOTHERGUNSHIP: FORGE. There’s also an incentive to sign up earlier. As Meta will offer you the subscription for $1 for the first month, but you’ll need to sign up by July 31 to get that deal. You also get to retain access to every game you claim as long as your subscription remains active. You also don’t lose the games you claimed if you ever cut the subscription off at any point. You’ll just need to resubscribe if you want to play them again. It seems like a pretty good deal if you play games on your Quest 2 or Quest Pro headset often. Meta says new games will pop up in the service on the first of every month too. Copyright ©2023 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
