Network administration is a complex and dynamic task that requires constant monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimization of the network infrastructure and services. To ensure the performance, security, and reliability of the network, network administrators need to track various metrics and indicators that reflect the network's health and efficiency. In this article, we will discuss how you can track network administration results using some common tools and methods.
 
One of the most important aspects of network administration is to measure and analyze the network performance, which includes parameters such as bandwidth, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and availability. Network performance monitoring tools can help you collect, visualize, and alert on these metrics, as well as identify bottlenecks, anomalies, and trends. Some examples of network performance monitoring tools are SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor, PRTG Network Monitor, and Nagios XI.

            Network Performance Monitoring provides a crucial mechanism for maintaining the quality and efficiency of network operations, ultimately resulting in enhanced connectivity, reduced downtime, and a better overall user experience. 
Another key aspect of network administration is to manage and maintain the network configuration, which includes the settings, policies, and rules that govern the network devices and services. Network configuration management tools can help you automate, backup, and audit the network configuration, as well as detect and resolve configuration errors, conflicts, and changes. Some examples of network configuration management tools are Cisco Network Configuration Manager, Ansible Network Automation, and RANCID.

            By utilizing specialized tools and software, network administrators can efficiently deploy, update, and maintain configurations across a variety of devices, such as routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers. This process allows for standardized setups, rapid deployment of changes, and adherence to security best practices.

Effective network configuration management involves version control, where changes are tracked and documented, making it easier to roll back to previous configurations if needed. It also helps with compliance requirements by ensuring configurations adhere to industry regulations and internal policies. 
Network security monitoring is a vital part of network administration, as it helps you protect the network from internal and external threats, such as malware, intrusions, denial-of-service attacks, and data breaches. Network security monitoring tools can help you scan, detect, and respond to network vulnerabilities, incidents, and events, as well as enforce network security policies and compliance standards. Some examples of network security monitoring tools are Snort, Suricata, and Splunk Enterprise Security.
 
Network inventory management is a useful function of network administration, as it helps you keep track of the network assets, such as hardware, software, licenses, and warranties. Network inventory management tools can help you discover, inventory, and document the network devices and applications, as well as manage their lifecycle and usage. Some examples of network inventory management tools are Spiceworks Network Inventory, Lansweeper, and Nmap.
 
Network reporting and analysis is a valuable outcome of network administration, as it helps you communicate and demonstrate the network results to various stakeholders, such as management, clients, and auditors. Network reporting and analysis tools can help you generate and customize network reports and dashboards, as well as perform network analysis and optimization. Some examples of network reporting and analysis tools are Cacti, Zabbix, and Wireshark.
 
Network feedback and improvement is an essential process of network administration, as it helps you continuously learn and improve the network performance, security, and reliability. Network feedback and improvement tools can help you collect and analyze network feedback from various sources, such as users, clients, and vendors, as well as implement network improvement actions and best practices. Some examples of network feedback and improvement tools are Net Promoter Score, Customer Satisfaction Survey, and Network Maturity Model.
