(Yep, even if you think you already know everything there is to know about them.) How well do you think you know your partner? Maybe you *just* exited the talking stage, so you know their favorite cocktail but not their family history—or you’ve been exclusive for years and could recite their daily routine from memory. Whether you’ve been dating for a few months or you’ve been married forever, it’s never too late to reignite the spark in your relationship by playing a question game together. While the actual questions can be lighthearted and fun, throwing in a few deep questions for couples can help you get to know your partner on a more intimate level.  “Human beings are ever-evolving, despite how well we believe we know them,” says Olivia Verhulst, LMHC, PMH-C, a licensed mental health counselor and Forbes Health Advisor based in New York. “It’s important to allow your partner to surprise you with new parts of them as you grow together—and to be curious about those parts.” If you’re in a long-term relationship, asking deep questions can also help you keep the spark alive, Verhulst says. “Quite often, I hear people say things like, ‘When the sex life dies in a relationship, that’s when you know you’re in trouble’—which isn’t always accurate,” Verhulst says. “I’ve seen more damage done when the curiosity begins to die,” she says.  Sure, it may be a little intimidating to get all deep and vulnerable with someone, but having the comfort and safe space to do so is one of the best parts of being in a relationship.  Asking each other questions can make for a cute date night for couples at any stage—plus, if you’re on the fence about Josh from Hinge, hearing their responses to deep questions may help you gauge if the situationship is worth it or not. You can ask different types of questions depending on your relationship timeline, but feel free to mix things up.  Here’s a list of 53 deep questions for couples to ask each other based on your relationship stage. If you’re in the early stages of dating, Verhulst says it’s the perfect time to ask questions that will help you set a strong foundation for the future. “Asking about their previous relational experiences and patterns can be valuable in developing a deeper understanding of the person and what to expect,” she explains. “This stage can also feel mysterious and sexy, which is a great opportunity to ask more playful questions about their hobbies and sexual preferences.” “For couples who are dating long term, the future of the relationship has likely come up for one or more partners in a significant way—whether that be financial planning, family planning, marriage, or living arrangements,” Verhulst says. If you’ve been dating someone for a while, it may be a good time to consider asking the “hard” questions about your partner’s needs and expectations, she says. While the newlywed stage can feel magical for many people, the “honeymoon blues” is a real thing, too, Verhulst says. To ensure that this time in your life stays fun and exciting, she suggests asking deep questions that will allow you to connect emotionally, set a positive tone for the future, and get any thoughts or hesitations out there. “Ask your SO questions that address your concerns, such as, ‘How do you feel you are adjusting to newlywed life?’” she says. If you’ve been married for a long time, Verhulst recommends asking questions that will remind you of your commitment to each other. “Your relationship may benefit from reminding your partner that you are still interested in ‘their world’ by asking questions about their day-to-day life,” she says, especially if you’re both busy and struggle to find time to connect. The questions don’t have to be mundane, though—explore topics that will help you both get excited about the future, too!
