Published on By As Nigerians look forward to the 2023 general elections, the League of Imams and Alfas in Ogun State have cautioned religious leaders and politicians to desist from making sermons and comments that could plunge the State into crisis before, during and after the polls. The Directorate of Leadership and Good Governance set up by the league made this known in a communique it released after a three-day interactive session with governorship candidates in Ogun. According to the communique jointly signed by the Chairman of the Directorate of Good Governance, Qasim Sanusi and the Secretary, Tajudeen Uthman, religious leaders were told to use the opportunity of their congregation to preach love and peaceful coexistence among the masses. In the communique made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, clerics of religious organizations were asked to stop sermons that are capable of compromising the peaceful co-existence being enjoyed in Ogun at the moment. In the same vein, the Islamic body urged politicians to be âOmoluabiâ as they go about their electioneering activities. The clerics charged them to eschew any form of violence and inciting utterances during their campaigns. Also, the Directorate charged residents of Ogun State to visit offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) or other designated places to collect their Permanent Votersâ Card (PVC) in preparation to vote for the best candidate. âThe progress and development of Ogun State is a must do task for all. Hence, we should join hands to accomplish it,â the group said. DAILY POST reports that seven political parties and their candidates had taken part in the interactive session organised by the Islamic leaders. The candidates had seized the opportunity to make known their plans for the State if elected, promising to tackle the challenges facing the State in various sectors. The candidates also declared a covenant with the people of Ogun State to serve them to the best of their ability and ensure proper administration of Local Governments in order to take dividends of democracy to the grassroots.
