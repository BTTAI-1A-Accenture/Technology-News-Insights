 YORK, Neb. (KLKN) – You may not expect a large crowd at a small-town basketball game, but in York, Nebraska, there’s quite the tradition. “Whether it’s basketball or volleyball, when we get to a final that we host, usually a business or a family steps up and makes a donation,” said York High School principal Jason Heitz. A donor will pay the admission fee for every York high school student who wants to attend a district final, which can make for a rowdy student section. “You can tell in the crowd, in all our games, it’s always packed, so it’s super cool to see the community come out and watch us,” said York student Marshall McCarthy. An anonymous family paid over $200 to sponsor the tickets to the girls’ basketball district final against Blair Saturday afternoon. As for the players, they’re grateful for the community support. “It’s nice to have people behind you, even when things are tough it’s nice to have the community,” said Mia Burke.
