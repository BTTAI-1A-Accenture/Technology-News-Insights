If you thought the Barkley Marathons was crazy, this new ultramarathon in Tanzania might change your mind. Launching in the summer of 2023, the Hadza 80K requires runners to only use their survival skills to sustain themselves.  This ultra will have no feed zones, water, or energy gels. Runners also won’t be allowed to bring supplies. Runners must gather their own water from natural rainwater or baobab trees (one tree can store as much as 136,400 litres of water), while food will have to come from fruit trees–or from hunting. One of the world’s few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes, the Hadza have lived in this way in the region for thousands of years. They live sustainably in Tanzania’s Yaeda Valley. The race will be held during their dry season, when the landscape is empty and unforgiving. According to the tribe, with the right skills, there is sufficient food and water in the dry season, and temperatures are moderate.   “It will be a tough course for the 50 to 100 racers expected to compete,” said race director Josue Stephens to the BBC. “Runners will need to know how to hunt and create fire.”  Stephens, who is from San Luis Obispo, Calif., has spent a few years running with the Tarahumara tribe in Mexico, the subject of the best-selling book Born to Run by Christopher McDougall. He was drawn to organizing a race with the Hadza by their impressive endurance and ability to live off the land. The course will be a challenge for most, with 80 kilometres in 30 C temperatures, at altitude (1,300m). Stephen expects 50 to 100 racers to compete when registration opens in the new year.  Some of the race proceeds will go directly to the Hadza tribe for using their land and sharing their survival skills. The tribe will use the money for healthcare, education and settling land disputes. Get the digital edition of Running for your chosen platform:
