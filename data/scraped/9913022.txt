Remember that your credit score must be 690 or above to get personal loans from USAA. The more your credit score, the less interest you have to pay each month.

However, you might have to pay %30-$40 of interest if you have a poor credit score. USAA doesn’t provide any small business loans for the members of the U.S. military or their members. The company launched a small business loan pilot program back in October 2018. USAA collaborated with StreetShares – a leading small business funding marketplace for this program. USAA members used to get business loans at a low interest rate. Unfortunately, the United Services Automobile Association doesn’t offer this loan anymore. They discontinued the small business pilot program for some reasons. However, you can still apply for personal loans for your small business needs.  There are several alternatives to USAA small business loans which you can apply for. Merchant Cash Advances is the best alternative to USAA’s business loans. What are Merchant Cash Advances? It doesn’t work like a loan; it provides cash to small business owners in advance.  A lender buys your latest products or avails your service and pays for it in Merchant Cash Advance. The only downside of this USAA small business loan alternative is it is its high APR. Besides, running a business for at least 1 year is required to qualify for Merchant Cash Advances. Here are the USAA small business loan alternatives that are currently available: Do you need a $2,500-$250,000 loan for your small business? Apply for short-term loans. It has a lower interest rate than Merchant Cash Advances. Debtors only need to pay a 10% APR for short-term loans. You get 3-18 months to repay the amount you borrow from the creditors. Invoice Financing is another great alternative to USAA loans. The best part about this loan is that it offers small company owners 90% of their outstanding invoices in advance. However, you must run the business for 6 months, and your annual revenue should be $50,000 to qualify for this loan. You can apply for Business Lines of Credits; it works like a business credit card. It offers credit limits of $10,000-$1 million to small business owners. Based on your credit score, you might have to bear a 7%-25% interest rate.  Additionally, you can go for Term loans to cover all the necessary business expenses. The creditor will decide the repayment time for this type of loan. You might have to pay a large amount of interest rate on Term loans. So, check the interest rate and repayment schedule before applying for any USAA small business loan alternatives.   I am glad you came over here. So, you want to know a little bit about me.
