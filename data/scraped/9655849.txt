It’s followed by the women’s 100m final and men’s 110m hurdles final on Monday, Aug. 21, during the evening session on USA Network and Peacock, expected to feature Richardson and defending champion Grant Holloway, respectively. The evening session on Tuesday, Aug. 22, will include the women’s 1500m final and is expected to feature defending champion and world record holder Faith Kipyegon (Kenya).

Lyles has stated that one of his goals is to break Bolt’s 200m world record in Budapest. Crouser aims to win his second consecutive shot put world title to cap off a historic 2023 outdoor season that saw him break his own world record in the event in May of this year. Richardson, competing at her first World Championships, aims to become the first U.S. woman to medal in the 100m at an outdoor World Championship since 2017. Reigning Olympic and defending 800m world champion Athing Mu, 2022 world 200m bronze medalist Erriyon Knighton, reigning Olympic and defending pole vault champion Katie Moon, two-time Tokyo Olympic medalist Gabby Thomas, defending 400m world champion Michael Norman, Tokyo Olympic and 2022 400m hurdles silver medalist Rai Benjamin, and a host of elite American athletes are expected to compete on the big stage with an eye on making the medal stand. On the international side, reigning Olympic 1500m champion and defending world 5000m champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen (Norway) looks to become the first man since Bernard Lagat in 2007 to sweep the 1500m/5000m double, while newly minted 1500m, mile and 5000m world record holder Faith Kipyegon aims to win an unprecedented third 1500m world title that would give her the most all-time.
