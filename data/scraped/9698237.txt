The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) has recently granted a comprehensive agreement contract for technology-related products and services, which includes a specialised category for acquiring and overseeing IT resources with a greater emphasis on sustainability. The Technology Products and Associated Services 2 agreement continues the progress of its predecessor, which is set to conclude in December 2023. This updated version extends its scope to encompass emerging and prospective technologies, important components like sustainable alternatives, specialised categories for healthcare and education, a readily available product catalogue, and independent technology-support services. This agreement represents the combination of three distinct CCS frameworks: For the first time, government entities now have the opportunity to source their technology devices and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software through a single channel provided by CCS. This initiative remains committed to offering value while furnishing public sector clients with a versatile, efficient, and compliant avenue to fulfil all their technology-related product and service needs. This includes end-user devices, technology infrastructure, network and security equipment, peripherals, and software requirements. This agreement strongly emphasises sustainability, featuring a dedicated category for recycling, data sanitisation, and secure disposal. It also encourages suppliers to prioritise extending the lifespan of products, granting the public sector access to refurbished and remanufactured goods and services aimed at enhancing the longevity of existing equipment. Substantial enhancements have been introduced to customers’ procurement options, offering alternative purchasing methods, specific guidance on leasing and utility models, and “as a service” approaches. This empowers buyers to explore various funding options and simplifies the procurement process. They now have the choice to pay only for the resources they utilise or distribute payments over time, reducing initial expenditure. 172 suppliers have been granted a position within the Technology Products and Associated Services 2 framework. This agreement is slated to become operational on October 31, 2023, and will initially run for 30 months, possibly extending for 18 months. Technology Products and Associated Services 2 will feature 172 suppliers, launching on October 31, 2023, for an initial 30-month term, extendable by an additional 18 months.
