The Ryder Cup was first contested in 1927 at Worcester Country Club in Worcester, Massachusetts. The U.S. was captained by Walter Hagen and the Americans won 9 ½ to 2 ½. In 2023, two years after getting routed 19-9 at Whistling Straits, the Europeans reclaimed the Ryder Cup, sweeping the first four matches on Thursday and riding a wave to a 16 ½ to 11 ½ victory. The Ryder Cup shifted back to odd years starting in 2021. Future Ryder Cup sites have been announced through 2037. Bethpage Black, Farmingdale, New York.
