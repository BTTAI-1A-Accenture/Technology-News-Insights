Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio's NDPP and BJP are contesting the elections to the 60-member assembly. Nagaland's Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP), the dominant regional power ruling the state in alliance with the BJP, announced its list of 40 candidates today. The list excludes 15 sitting MLAs. The BJP, which is contesting in 20 seats, also dropped a sitting MLA. Party sources said the MLAs have been dropped to give a chance to new faces.
