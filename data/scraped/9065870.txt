The 2023 dirt race at Bristol was the second. The first took place during the 2022 season when they headed to the inaugural Cup Series race at World Wide Technology Raceway and hosted Pre-Race Live With Kenny Wallace. There were multiple reasons for Wallace and Roberts to bring back the live pre-race show in 2022. One that the former Xfinity Series Most Popular Driver specifically mentioned is that fans at home would want to attend races after seeing the jam-packed areas at the track. The sight of thousands of attendees would make viewers want to experience it for themselves. Wallace was not the only person hyping up the return of the pre-race show. SMI President and CEO Marcus Smith also did so in 2021 by tweeting that he was not giving up on bringing back the live pre-race shows. Nearly two years later, the efforts are paying off. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been talking to Kenny about coming back for years and he finally took us up on going back on the road,‚Äù Smith said in a press release. ‚ÄúThe fans in Bristol absolutely loved it this weekend and we‚Äôre excited to bring Kenny, J-R and Race Day Live to six more races this year. These guys bring the fun and take the fan zone energy to a whole new level!‚Äù ¬†
