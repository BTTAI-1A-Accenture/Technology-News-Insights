    The China Connect service has now been discontinued. UCL commissioned the China Connect service during the COVID pandemic to enable students in mainland China to experience reliable and consistent access to the resources they needed to support their teaching and learning activities. This service proved invaluable during the pandemic period when teaching was delivered remotely. Since the return to in-person teaching and learning, there has been a marked reduction in use of this service and the service has now been discontinued. If you still require access to this type of application or have any questions about the removal of this service please get in touch via MyServices.
