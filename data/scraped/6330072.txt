It’s the Fratello Show with our very special guest star! “It’s time to play the music / It’s time to light the lights / It’s time to meet this Oris on the Fratello Show tonight.”  If you recognize the line above, you will enjoy the video that Lex recorded with none other than Kermit the Frog. Both of them will be presenting the new Oris ProPilot X Kermit Edition to you. It’s a funky green-dialed ProPilot X that shows the friendliest Muppet on the first day of every month.  You can watch the video with Kermit above or on our YouTube channel (here). All details of the Oris ProPilot X Kermit can be found here as well, in our introduction article. Kermit is played by our social media lead content creator Sinara, while Lex plays Lex. Your Comment* Your name *  Your e-mail address (will not be published) *

 Oris can use their existing blue for Gonzo – I’d get that. Or a lighter blue for Sam Eagle, orange for Beaker. And what about Statler and Waldorf? Don’t know what colour would be used but it would be awesome to have those two on a watch! They should save those 2 for a model with a day-date configuration, and put one character on each wheel. Lol. Great idea! Oris, please do this. Kermit can’t speak? Did he have a frog in his throat? ? Exactly that, Gary. Poor frog. Give us a Gonzo! Kermit makes me smile, yes, no doubt, but the Oris, sorry, nope …maybe I’m getting old © 2004 – 2024 Fratello Watches BV
