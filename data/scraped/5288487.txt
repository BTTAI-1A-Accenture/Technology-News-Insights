Reviewed Updated: Jul 16, 2024, 3:54pm Medical students face a set of unique circumstances when financing their education: high medical school costs and periods of comparatively low income during residency, along with potential eligibility for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness if they work in nonprofit or government jobs after graduation.That means federal direct unsubsidized loans are medical students’ best first option for financing, since they have low interest rates, flexible repayment options and qualify for forgiveness. After using unsubsidized loans, graduate PLUS loans may help fill funding gaps; private student loans could also be an option if you have a plan to pay them off quickly.Below we have identified the best federal and private loans for medical students based on features like fees, repayment flexibility and ease of the application process.Rates and details accurate as of August 16, 2024.Related: Compare Personalized Student Loan Rates

 Among graduate student loan options, federal direct unsubsidized loans are the best overall deal: Their fixed interest rate is one of the lowest you’ll find, and this type of loan isn’t credit-based and doesn’t require a co-signer. All eligible graduate borrowers qualify, and they receive the same rate regardless of credit history. While there’s a chance the most creditworthy borrowers could get a lower interest rate with a private student loan, they’ll miss out on a range of consumer protections that might be useful in the future. Borrowers of federal direct unsubsidized loans have access to income-driven repayment options that can lower the amount due and loan forgiveness for those who work in public service fields. Direct unsubsidized loans come with an origination fee of 1.057%, while most private graduate loans do not. But in many cases, the low interest rate and loan benefits make the fee worth it. Loan terms: Terms of 10 to 25 years are available, depending on the repayment plan. Loan amounts: Loan amounts up to $20,500 per year and $138,500 in aggregate are available, including loans used for undergraduate study. Eligibility: You must be enrolled at least half-time in a school that participates in the federal direct loan program. Forbearance options: Forbearance available for up to three years in certain circumstances. Enrolling in an income-driven repayment program can lower monthly payments and result in loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years. Co-signer release policy: N/A

 9.08% (graduate school only) The federal graduate PLUS loan also offers wide-ranging benefits to borrowers, but fewer than direct unsubsidized loans offer. Since borrowing limits are higher for PLUS loans than direct unsubsidized loans, they’re an option to cover any funding gaps after you’ve maxed out direct unsubsidized loans for graduate study. The graduate PLUS interest rate is slightly higher than the unsubsidized loan rate; the origination fee—4.228%, which comes out of the loan amount that’s disbursed to you—is much higher. PLUS loans are also the only federal loan type that require a credit check, but it’s possible to get a PLUS loan even if you’re determined to have an adverse credit history (more on that below). Loan terms: 10 to 25 years, depending on the repayment plan Loan amounts available: Up to total cost of attendance, minus other financial aid received Eligibility: Must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible school. Must not have an adverse credit history. Forbearance options: Forbearance available for up to three years in certain circumstances. Enrolling in an income-driven repayment program can lower monthly payments and result in loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years. Co-signer release policy: None

Borrowers also can get a cash back reward of 1% of the loan’s original principal balance upon graduation. Ascent’s maximum interest rates are higher than many other lenders’ on our list, though, topping out at over 13%.

 Many international students don’t qualify for federal student loans, and they typically need a U.S. citizen co-signer in order to get approved for a private student loan. Prodigy Finance is a London-based company that offers private student loans to international master’s students without requiring a co-signer. You must attend an eligible school  in one of the 18 countries Prodigy Finance lends in. All interest rates are variable, meaning they can change with market conditions, and borrowers receive rate offers based on their course of study and future earning potential. The average rate, according to Prodigy Finance, is 7.3%. The loan comes with a 4% administration fee. Prodigy Finance doesn’t lend to U.S.-based borrowers living in these states: Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming. Loan terms: 7 to 20 years Loan amounts available: $15,000 minimum; maximum amount based on individual application. Eligibility:  Must be a resident of an eligible state and country attending an eligible school either part-time or full-time Forbearance options:  Available for nine months. Borrowers with financial hardships may apply for an interest-free payment arrangement; those facing low incomes, medical emergencies, unexpected family responsibilities or unemployment can apply for $0 or reduced payments.

Borrowers have multiple repayment terms to choose from, and graduate students receive a nine-month grace period³ before they must make payments after graduation, which is longer than the typical six-month grace period. Earnest doesn’t have a co-signer release program. That means borrowers who use a co-signer must keep that person on the loan unless they  refinance it into their own name. Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 12 or 15 years⁴ Loan amounts available: $1,000 up to total cost of attendance (no aggregate loan amount listed). Eligibility⁵: Students must be attending school at least half-time. International students can apply with a U.S. citizen co-signer. Forbearance options: Available for up to 12 months throughout the loan term Co-signer release policy: None Disclosures ¹You can take advantage of the Auto Pay interest rate reduction by setting up and maintaining active and automatic ACH withdrawal of your loan payment from a checking or savings account. The interest rate reduction for Auto Pay will be available only while your loan is enrolled in Auto Pay. Interest rate incentives for utilizing Auto Pay may not be combined with certain private student loan repayment programs that also offer an interest rate reduction. For multi-party loans, only one party may enroll in Auto Pay. It is important to note that the 0.25% Auto Pay discount is not available while loan payments are deferred. ²Earnest clients may skip one payment every 12 months. Your first request to skip a payment can be made once you’ve made at least 6 months of consecutive on-time payments, and your loan is in good standing. The interest accrued during the skipped month will result in an increase in your remaining minimum payment. The final payoff date on your loan will be extended by the length of the skipped payment periods. Please be aware that a skipped payment does count toward the forbearance limits. Please note that skipping a payment is not guaranteed and is at Earnest’s discretion. Your monthly payment and total loan cost may increase as a result of postponing your payment and extending your term. ³Nine-month grace period is not available for borrowers who choose our Principal and Interest Repayment plan while in school. ⁴Earnest’s Loan Cost Examples: These examples provide estimates based on principal and Interest payments beginning immediately upon loan disbursement.

All rights reserved. Federal direct unsubsidized student loans are a strong option for medical students because they don’t require a credit check or a co-signer. They also can be forgiven through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program or via income-driven repayment plans. If you need more money for school than what unsubsidized loans provide, you might turn to graduate PLUS loans, which require a credit check. But there are specific negative marks the government is looking for. You’ll be considered to have “adverse credit history” if you have one or more of the following on your credit report: But if you learn you have an adverse credit history after you apply, you can explain the circumstances that led to it, and the government could determine that you’re eligible for a PLUS loan after receiving loan counseling. Another option is to get an endorser, similar to a co-signer, that can help you qualify. Some borrowers might qualify for a lower rate on a private medical student loan than on a PLUS loan. But when comparing interest rates among private lenders, know that only the borrowers with the highest credit scores, least outstanding debt and strongest incomes will get the lowest rates. That could mean using a co-signer. All private loan rates listed on this page also include a standard 0.25% interest rate discount for using automatic payments. Since medical students often stand to earn significant incomes after graduation, you may be able to pay off a private loan quickly to avoid substantial interest accrual. But only do so if you don’t plan to qualify for loan forgiveness through federal programs, or you take out a minimal amount of private loans. It’s best to identify the interest rate and terms you’d receive on a private loan, then compare the overall cost and features with those of a PLUS loan. A student loan calculator can help you determine how much you’ll pay over time. As a medical school student, you have two main options for student loans: federal loans and private loans. Here’s a closer look at both types of financing.  The U.S. Department of Education provides federal student loans to students at eligible schools. As a medical school student, you can access two types:  It’s often a good idea to borrow federal student loans before turning to private ones since these loans have competitive fixed interest rates and are eligible for a variety of repayment plans, including income-driven repayment. Federal loans can also qualify for federal protections such as deferment, forbearance and loan forgiveness.  You can also find private student loans for medical school from private lenders, including banks, credit unions and online lenders. You may need fair or good credit to qualify for a private student loan. Alternatively, you could boost your chances of approval by applying with a co-signer.  Rates and terms will vary by lender, but having good or excellent credit can help you get a better rate.  Before taking on debt for medical school, consider both the advantages and potential downsides.  The process of applying for a medical school loan will differ depending on the type of loan you want. For federal student loans, start by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  Your school will notify you if you qualify for any Direct unsubsidized loans. You can choose to accept all, part or some of the loan amount that you’re offered. If you want to take out a Grad PLUS loan, you can apply on the Federal Student Aid website.  If, on the other hand, you want to borrow a private student loan, these are the general steps you’ll need to take:  
 We collected data from 11 student loan entities that offer medical school loans in at least 25 U.S. states and scored them across 12 data points in the categories of interest rates, fees, loan terms, hardship options, application process and eligibility. We chose the best to display based on those earning three stars or higher. The following is the weighting assigned to each category: Specific characteristics taken into consideration within each category included availability of residency deferment programs, hardship repayment options beyond traditional forbearance, origination fees, length of post-school grace period and other factors. Lenders who offered maximum interest rates below 12% scored the highest, as did those who offered more than the standard six-month grace period, who offered interest rate discounts beyond the standard 0.25% for automatic payments, who charged no origination fees and who offered a co-signer release option. In some cases, lenders were awarded partial points, and a maximum of 3% of the final score was left to editorial discretion based on the quality of consumer-friendly features offered. To learn more about how Forbes Advisor rates lenders, and our editorial process, check out our Loans Rating & Review Methodology. Personal Finance Writer Rebecca Safier contributed to this article. Since medical students often have to take on significant debt, the federal vs. private question is especially consequential. If there’s a chance you could qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which generously offers full, tax-free forgiveness after 120 months of qualifying payments, opt for entirely or mostly federal student loans. The American Association of Medical Colleges offers resources and guidance for medical students on evaluating jobs and residency programs that can qualify you for this program. If you plan to go immediately into private practice, for instance, or will not likely take on any PSLF-qualifying employment in your career, private loans are a safer bet. But their interest rates can be much higher than what you’ll get on a federal direct unsubsidized loan. Ideally, put as much money as you comfortably can after graduation toward repaying private loans to avoid accumulating big interest charges. Private student loans usually offer variable and fixed interest rates that are based on the borrower’s creditworthiness. Variable rates rise and fall according to the index they follow. For example, the lender may use the prime rate as its benchmark. If you have good or excellent credit, then you’ll be eligible for a lower interest rate. But if you have poor or fair credit, prepare for an interest rate on the higher end of the range. Using a creditworthy co-signer can help you get a lower rate. The amount you can borrow for medical school will depend on the type of student loan you take out. Direct unsubsidized loans, for example, have an aggregate borrowing limit of $138,500. Grad PLUS loans let you borrow up to your school’s full cost of attendance, minus any other financial aid you’ve already received. Some private lenders also let you borrow up to your school’s cost of attendance, while others set lower limits. Some private lenders offer to release the co-signer from a loan after the borrower makes a certain number of payments. That can protect the co-signer from a credit hit as a result of the primary borrower’s negative payment history. If you plan to use co-signer release, check your loan documents to see when it will be possible (in 36 months, for instance) and what additional requirements you might need to meet.
