McLaren’s Oscar Piastri followed up his victory in Saturday’s 19-lap dash by taking second place while his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris completed the podium.

Without the penalties, you can add 15 seconds to his time. A missed opportunity to try and cement that second place. We need to get that form back, we know he’s got it within him. “He’s got in a bit of a spiral, he needs to put the breaks on that, reset, and really attack it. “We really need Checo to get in that window, it’s not this year so much but next year when we need to fire on all cylinders. “We have a contract with Sergio, we’re not seeing the best from him, we’re going to support him as much as we can.” 20:58 , Kieran Jackson Race report  A furious George Russell lashed out at Lewis Hamilton following a dramatic crash with his Mercedes team-mate at the very first corner of Sunday’s Qatar Grand Prix.

It was like an oven. Huge challenge. I sometimes train in sauna and you push your body to the limit and you want to get out, it was lap 12 how I felt. In the cockpit it’s near 50C. Fireproof layer, race suit, hot air coming from the cars, you can’t cool down, your drink system is hot. It’s like a hairdryer blowing in your face for an hour and a half.” “Borderline too much, pretty crazy, but we’re doing what we love. 20:30 , Kieran Jackson For the 14th time this season, the Dutch and Austrian national anthems ring out on the podium! 20:17 , Kieran Jackson “What made the race was my first stint.
