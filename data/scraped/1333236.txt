Dashlane has made the source code for its Android and iOS apps open source under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license Now the source code is available on GitHub. This step has been taken to increase transparency. “We also believe in a more open digital world in which developers can easily participate and connect with each other. This is our contribution to this ambition and another step in that direction,” adds the announcement. Now that the source code is available, anyone can explore and audit the code. White hat hackers can try to find vulnerabilities or security issues and report them to the company. Dashlane has an HackerOne program where they pay a bounty of up to $5,000 for critical flaws.

If you are interested in checking the source code, you can find the Android app code and the iOS app code on GitHub. I want to make it clear that only source code for Android and iOS apps has been made open source. The macOS and Windows clients are still closed-source. The company has also not released the code for the system that works on the Dashlane’s servers. You must be logged in to post a comment.
