The transaction is expected to close in the first half of SAIC’s fiscal year 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. “Today’s announcement represents a milestone in SAIC’s priority to shape our portfolio and advance our strategy,” said Nazzic Keene, Chief Executive Officer at SAIC. “The agreement allows for seamless transition and continued support for the logistics and supply chain management business and their important customer missions, while enabling SAIC to concentrate resources in our Growth & Technology Accelerant areas of focus. These areas include Secure Cloud, Enterprise IT and Systems Integration & Delivery which now account for more than 30% of SAIC revenue.” SAIC’s logistics and supply chain solutions are used by the Defense Logistics Agency to manage multiple supply chains for the agency’s customers.
