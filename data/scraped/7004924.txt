LONDON â€“ Muhammad Mokaev went from almost getting submitted to notching a submission of his own at UFC 286. Mokaevâ€™s (9-0 MMA, 4-0 UFC)Â grappling was in full display but late in Round 3, Jafel Filho (14-3 MMA, 0-1 UFC)Â locked in a tight kneebar which had him in big trouble. Mokaev, who already came into the fight with an injured shoulder, toughed it out and wound up cinching a rear-naked choke at the 4:32 mark of Round 3 Saturday at The O2.
