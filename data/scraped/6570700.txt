Revolutionary global ride-sharing service inDrive is doubling down
on its successful marketing efforts in Australia after a
period of rapid growth has the company poised to launch in
several key regions across the country this
year.inDrive, with more than 150 million downloads of
the platform in 47 countries, is revolutionising the
rideshare experience through its unique model, which allows
riders and drivers to negotiate fares. Instead of
manipulating prices through impersonal algorithms, often
leading to unnecessary and crushing fees, inDrive brings
transparency, and most importantly, fairness, through its
process.Embraced by riders and drivers alike in
Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, inDrive is taking to the
streets with a digital truck mobile advertising campaign to
tour Sydney’s CBD and nearby suburbs during the upcoming
Vivid Festival.“The streets of Sydney come alive
during its flagship festival of light, and people in the
millions converge upon the CBD and surrounding suburbs to
take in the unique exhibits on display,” said Mike
Chauhan, Country Manager for inDrive. “Those people need a
way home, and inDrive is the best and most affordable ride
share option for longer trips, particularly with surge
pricing set to make rideshare unaffordable for most people
during a peak period of activity in Sydney.“Our
model is peer-to-peer, meaning drivers and riders alike
quickly negotiate on a fare that’s fair for both
parties.



“We’ve seen tremendous growth in our
three key markets, and now is the time to double down on our
marketing efforts and ensure that our fair model is front of
mind among Sydneysiders when they need it most. This
activation is the first pillar in those efforts being ramped
up, not just in Sydney but across
Australia.”inDrive has been incredibly active with
its marketing and advertising efforts to date, with ads
adorning bus stops and public transport alike. The company
has also undertaken sustained key influencer campaign,
working with the likes of rugby league stars in the
Queensland market and several TikTok campaigns targeting the
east coast metropolitan hubs.The efforts to date have
been wildly successful, with growth in downloads and rides
“exceeding expectations” according to
Chauhan.“We see marketing as going hand-in-hand
with business development, particularly in the rideshare
sector,” he said. “Our key message is helping
Australians understand two key ideas: that there is a fairer
way to rideshare, a way that isn’t dictated by algorithms
but by people; and that inDrive is the best choice for
longer rides.“So far, the messages are working and
we’re ready to continue the momentum, led by our marketing
efforts.”Due to its successful launch in the three
major east coast markets, the company is set to launch in a
number of key new markets this year, including a launch in a
regional hub.How inDriver worksinDrive’s
model allows riders to set a suggested fare for the selected
route, then negotiate with the driver to reach an agreed
amount. Ideally suited to longer routes and fares, the
minimum ride starts from between $15 to $25 depending on the
city. From there, for longer distance rides or for rides
during peak periods, riders and drivers alike will be able
to negotiate prices which will often be below those of other
rideshare applications. This can include trips to the
airport, where airport transport tariffs can make trips for
many riders prohibitively expensive – the longer the
distance the better the price, with drivers and riders alike
able to agree on the final fare.The passenger makes
their request for a ride, indicating a starting point and
destination, their suggested price, and any additional
comments for the driver, such as a request for a
children’s car seat or an additional stop.From
there, drivers have the ability to either accept the offered
fare or make a counteroffer. The passenger is then presented
with offers from multiple drivers and can then choose the
right driver best suited to the passenger’s needs, taking
into consideration the fare amount, driver information and
ratings, estimated time of arrival, and vehicle
make/model.Australian drivers have described the app
as “flexible” and with a “positive” user experience,
and riders appreciate the benefits of the “easy-to-use”
app and “fair pricing”.inDrive is available to
download on Google
Play and the AppStore.
