But thanks to nothing short of a humongous sale on SGIN’s WiFi Digital Photo Frame, you can store and display literally thousands of photos and videos of your dog (up to 40,000 photos, in fact, with the included 16GB of storage!). SGIN WiFI Digital Photo Frame | $100 | 82% Off | Amazon Simply connect your frame to WiFi and use the included app to seamlessly share photos from phone to frame. You can even invite unlimited users to contribute media (“Mom, enough with the baby pics!”).
