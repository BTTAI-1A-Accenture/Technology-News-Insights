The development is set to transform the housing landscape in Chatham County, with 15% of its units dedicated to workforce housing.  Situated on 92 acres, Northwood Landing is a Lowes Food-anchored shopping center across from MOSAIC at Chatham Park on U.S. 501 in Pittsboro, near the Raleigh-Durham metro area.   The groundbreaking ceremony, attended by partners, community leaders and local officials, showcased the beginning of a project that is promising to meet the region’s growing housing needs.   Designed by architect Kerry Finley and developed by Lee Moore Capital Company, Medley at Northwood Landing is poised to take shape in the coming days. The project has already seen substantial progress in sitework, and vertical construction is set to commence in the upcoming weeks. The delivery of the first apartments is expected in the spring of 2024.   “We are thrilled to be contributing much-needed housing to Chatham County,” said CCC representative Carter Keller.   Kirk Bradley of Lee Moore Capital echoed these sentiments, noting, “This project is not only necessary but will also provide a beautifully situated housing opportunity for those choosing to live, work and play in Pittsboro and Chatham County.”  Mayor Cindy Perry, who was also in attendance at the groundbreaking ceremony, emphasized the project’s strategic location, highlighting its proximity to downtown Pittsboro and its accessibility to local shops, a grocery store and essential services.   This commitment to walkability aligns with the ongoing efforts to enhance the community’s livability.   Teams from Chatham Park, Mosaic at Chatham Park, Chatham County Economic Development Corporation, Finley Design, elected officials and other prominent community leaders were also present for the ceremony. The event venue not only showcased the development site but also featured interior and exterior renderings, offering attendees a glimpse at the project’s future aesthetic.  “It takes significant collaboration to reach this point,” said Keller. “Today, we acknowledge the tireless efforts of our partners and stakeholders, all of whom have been instrumental in making this project a reality.”  Medley at Northwood Landing is set to redefine housing options in Chatham County, addressing the pressing demand for innovative and accessible living spaces. As construction progresses, the community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this development will have on the region’s residents.
