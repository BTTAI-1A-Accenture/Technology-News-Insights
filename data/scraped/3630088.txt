Advertisement Advance Auto Parts will provide free gasoline for four years to 10 winners of its “Fuel Ride to College” sweepstakes, with 20 additional winners of the sweepstakes receiving a $100 Advance gift card. The retailer also is offering students and their parents a range of “off to campus” in-store services at its stores nationwide including free battery testing and installation, wiper blade installation and check engine light scanning. Recent data from Atomik Research, commissioned by Advance Auto Parts, indicated that 67% of college students cite gas for their cars as the expense that causes the most financial strain, and 76% of parents of incoming freshmen said they’re worried about their children’s ability to afford gas. Additionally, 63% of these parents feel either “very” or “extremely” anxious about their child’s safety in terms of maintaining their cars, and 73% have more anxiety about the cars’ safety for incoming college freshmen compared to their senior year of high school. Case in point, more than half of college students said they’ve ignored dashboard alerts such as “check engine” or “low battery warning.” “Starting college is exciting for incoming freshmen, but that excitement is accompanied by anxiety and worry for both students and their parents, especially regarding finances and safety,” said Samantha Avivi, Chief Marketing Officer at Advance in a statement. “Through our ‘Fuel Ride to College’ program and complimentary curbside services for motorists, we want to put the brakes on fuel-filled worries for both students and parents, especially when it comes to having a reliable and safe automobile on the road to college, around campus, back home and everywhere in between.” Advertisement Join the retail community as we come together for three days of strategic sessions, meaningful off-site networking events and interactive learning experiences.
