Inno Matijane Exposes Sammy Sosa Over A 2016 Unsettled Debt. Money has destroyed family bonds, killed romance, turned friends into enemies among other things. If those close to you can do you dirt over money, then what more of strangers. That is why before you can borrow anyone money, you need to have a written contract and also do a serious background check on them. Sadly even if you can do whatever it takes to be on the safe side, a person who doesn’t want to pay you back, won’t do so. One person who knows the pain of being owed money or a very long time is, Inno Matijane. The reality TV star, musician and media personality has opened up about his pain on social media. According to Inno, the person who owes her is Sammy Sosa, a familiar face in the industry. This happened back in 2016, when Inno gave Sammy Sosa money for the two to record a song together, as he was aspiring to break into the industry. Inno who was 18 years old at the time, asked his mother for the money, that amounted to R20k. After giving Sammy Sosa the money nothing ever materialized and she started giving him the runaround until today. Now Inno wants to be paid what has been due to him for the past five years. He took to social media to call out the former IT girl, who used to be a powerhouse in the industry back then.  A post shared by Inno (@innomatijane) [outbrain_sidebar_ad]
