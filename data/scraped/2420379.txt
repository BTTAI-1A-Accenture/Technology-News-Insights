Rosé from the K-pop group Blackpink was spotted in a popular webtoon by fans of the group. The group made their initial debut in animation form for their project with PUBG and ZEPETO. The webtoon is called The Empress’ Lipstick and follows a character named Jae In who is transported into an alternate universe where she is a princess after she touches a unique lipstick. The creator referenced another idol earlier when she drew V from BTS in an episode. In the chapter, the creator touched upon what an impact appearance has in society and references two influencers who appear frequently on social media. The image of one of the people struck fans as familiar and after some research, they were able to pinpoint Rose’s campaign picture for the luxury brand Tiffany & Co. The creator referenced all the key details including the outfit, jewellery and hairstyle.   Cardi B has been quietly working on her second album despite recently declaring 'NO album this year' Kelly Ripa paid homage to Phil Donahue after show host’s death the age of 88 Channing Tatum attended Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour concert at London’s Wembley stadium Taylor Swift spotted meeting with young Southport stabbing victims backstage Duchess of Edinburgh and Prince Edward join King Charles for Royal Family gathering Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin have had issues in the past but things are great now, claims source Copyright © 2024.
