 Five female leaders at Edison, N.J.-based Hackensack Meridian Health all started their careers tending to patients at the bedside. Today, they occupy top rungs in the health care leadership ladder. The five nurses-to-execs are C-suite leaders throughout the HMH system. They have many things in common: compassion and dedication; the ability to see the high level view even when in the weeds in the hospital boardroom; and the fervent belief that with a nurse mindset, anything is possible. Selected comments from their interviews with Becker’s included these: “I began to think more expansively about how the hospital was run and how all departments affected the patient and team member experience.” “We want nurses to remain here for the duration of their career. We have a nursing leadership development program that's structured to cultivate the next generation of nursing leaders.” “A nurse's expertise and vantage point is extremely important in helping a hospital run effectively. We are patient-focused, collaborative and compassionate.” And simply, “Nurses make great leaders.” Noncommercial use of original content on www.aha.org is granted to AHA Institutional Members, their employees and State, Regional and Metro Hospital Associations unless otherwise indicated.
