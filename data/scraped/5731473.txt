Cauliflower contains many nutrients and plant compounds that may reduce the risk of several diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Cauliflower is an extremely healthy vegetable that’s a significant source of nutrients.  Additionally, it’s weight loss-friendly and incredibly easy to add to your diet. Here are 8 science-based health benefits of cauliflower.  The nutrition profile of cauliflower is quite impressive.  Cauliflower is very low in calories yet rich in a variety of vitamins and minerals (1).  Here is an overview of the nutrients found in 1 cup, or 107 grams (g), of raw cauliflower (1):  Cauliflower is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, folate, and vitamin K. Cauliflower is quite high in fiber, which is beneficial for overall health.  There are 2 g of fiber in 1 cup (107 g) of raw cauliflower, which is 7% of your daily needs (1).  Fiber is important because it feeds the healthy bacteria in your gut that help reduce inflammation and promote digestive health (2, 3). Consuming enough fiber may help lower the risk of digestive conditions like constipation, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4, 5, 6). Moreover, studies show that a diet high in fiber-rich vegetables like cauliflower is linked with a lower risk of several illnesses, including heart disease, cancer, and diabetes (7, 8). Fiber may also play a role in obesity prevention, due to its ability to promote fullness and reduce overall calorie intake (2, 9). Cauliflower contains a high amount of fiber, which is important for digestive health and may reduce the risk of several chronic diseases. Cauliflower is a great source of antioxidants, which protect your cells from harmful free radicals and inflammation (10). Similar to other cruciferous vegetables, cauliflower is particularly high in glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, two groups of antioxidants that have been shown to slow the growth of cancer cells (11, 12, 13). Cauliflower contains carotenoid and flavonoid antioxidants as well, which have anti-cancer effects and may reduce the risk of several other illnesses, including heart disease (14, 15, 16, 17, 18). What’s more, cauliflower contains high amounts of vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant. Vitamin C is also well-known for its anti-inflammatory effects that may boost immune health and reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer (19, 20, 21). Cauliflower provides a significant amount of antioxidants, which are beneficial for reducing inflammation and protecting against several chronic diseases. Cauliflower has several properties that may help with weight loss.  First, it is low in calories with only 27 calories per cup (107 g), so you can eat a lot of it without significantly increasing your calorie intake (1). It can also serve as a low calorie substitute for high calorie foods, such as rice and flour. As a good source of fiber, cauliflower slows digestion and promotes feelings of fullness. This may help reduce the number of calories you eat throughout the day, an important factor in weight control (2, 9). High water content is another weight loss-friendly aspect of cauliflower. In fact, 92% of its weight is made up of water. Consuming lots of water-dense, low calorie foods is associated with weight loss (1, 22).  Cauliflower is low in calories but high in fiber and water — all properties that may assist in weight loss. Cauliflower is high in choline, an essential nutrient that many people don’t consume enough of (23). One cup (107 g) of cauliflower contains 44 milligrams of choline, which is about 10% of the adequate intake for females and 8% for males (1, 24). Choline has several important functions in the body.  To begin with, it plays a major role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes, synthesizing DNA, and supporting metabolism (25, 26). Choline is also involved in brain development and the production of neurotransmitters that are necessary for a healthy nervous system. What’s more, it helps prevent cholesterol from accumulating in the liver (26). Animal studies suggest choline deficiency may increase the risk of liver disease and neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s (27, 28, 29). Cauliflower is a good source of choline, a nutrient many people are lacking. It is involved in many processes in the body and works to prevent several diseases. Cauliflower contains sulforaphane, an antioxidant that has been studied extensively (30). Many test-tube and animal studies have found sulforaphane to be particularly helpful for suppressing cancer development by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in cancer and tumor growth (31, 32). Research shows that sulforaphane may also help reduce high blood pressure and keep arteries healthy — both major factors in preventing heart disease (33, 34).  Finally, animal studies suggest that sulforaphane may also play a role in diabetes prevention and reducing the risk of diabetes-induced complications, such as kidney disease (35, 36, 37). While more research is necessary to determine the extent of sulforaphane’s effects in humans, its potential health benefits are promising.  Cauliflower is rich is sulforaphane, a plant compound with many beneficial effects, such as reduced risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Cauliflower is incredibly versatile and can be used to replace grains and legumes in your diet.  Not only is this a fantastic way to increase your veggie intake, but it is also especially helpful for those who follow low carb diets.  This is because cauliflower is significantly lower in carbs than grains and legumes.  For example, 1 cup (107 g) of cauliflower contains 5 g of carbs. At the same time, 1 cup (158 g) of rice contains 44 g of carbs — almost nine times the amount in cauliflower (1, 38). Here are some examples of recipes that can be made with cauliflower instead of grains and legumes:  Cauliflower can replace grains and legumes in many recipes, which is a great way to eat more veggies or follow a low carb diet. Not only is cauliflower versatile, but it’s also very easy to add to your diet.  To begin with, you can consume it raw, which requires very little preparation. You can enjoy raw cauliflower florets as a snack dipped in hummus or another healthy vegetable dip.  Cauliflower can also be cooked in a variety of ways, such as steaming, roasting, or sautéing. It makes an excellent side dish or can be combined with dishes like soups, salads, stir-fries, and casseroles. Not to mention, it’s fairly cheap and widely available at most grocery stores.
