Model Jeff Thomas has died in a suspected suicide, TMZ reported Wednesday. He was 35. Law enforcement sources told the outlet that they received a call on March 8 reporting Thomas’ body had been found after he allegedly jumped from the balcony of his Miami apartment; however, cops are still investigating. His death is being viewed as an apparent suicide, but the autopsy results for a conclusive cause of death have yet to be released. Thomas boasted a strong social media presence — he had more than 120,000 followers on Instagram — and was represented by London’s AMCK Models. He also founded a contemporary art consulting agency, One Popsicle. Thomas shared a photo of himself performing a cold plunge for his mental health on the same day police received the report about his death. “A cold plunge a day, keeps the doctor away 💧 #coldplunge #wellness #mentalhealth,” he captioned the post. Just a few days before that, Thomas shared a picture of a new tattoo that read “resilience,” which appears to have served as a symbol for what he had been struggling with in private. Fans, followers and friends have been flooding his Instagram account with messages of grief and mourning since reading the news of his untimely death. “It was a pleasure to have been your agent. You did everything you needed to do to succeed in the biz,” wrote Gerald Frankowski. “Frustrating at times but I knew your goals and your passion to get there. “More important was the friendship we developed afterwards,” Frankowski continued. “Your heart was always in the right place. RIP #DIT.” One close friend mourned the loss of all the “plans” that wouldn’t be fulfilled. “My sweet Jeff ❤️ we were just making plans, you were just making jokes, we were just daydreaming about Europe together. It’s so hard to process, to think that there won’t be a next time,” Brittany DeValdenebro wrote. “There’s such a void. I know deep down you know that,” she continued. “You know we loved you so much and always wanted the best for you, the same way you wanted it for everyone els. I’m going to miss you, your smile, your texts, your dancing so so so much.” If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call or text the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.
