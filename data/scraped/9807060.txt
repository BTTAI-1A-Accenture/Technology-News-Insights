Miami Heat veteran Udonis Haslem is in his 20th and final season with the team and likely played in his last game Sunday. As he was honored ahead of the Heat's regular-season finale against the Orlando Magic, center Bam Adebayo interrupted with a gift. ‚ÄúThere you go man, take your seat,‚Äù Adebayo said, gesturing toward a custom rocking chair. Initially offering it to Heat great Dwyane Wade, who stood courtside, Haslem eventually sat down with a smile. Before the interruption, Haslem thanked his family and spoke to his hometown fans for their support throughout his long career.

That‚Äôs beautiful. And that‚Äôs why it made it all so easy just to sacrifice everything.‚Äù Spending his whole career in Miami, he will retire as the franchise's all-time leading rebounder and a three-time champion. The Heat will retire his No. 40 jersey next season. Only Haslem, Dirk Nowitzki and Kobe Bryant remained with one franchise for two decades. Sunday marked Haslem's seventh appearance this season. Playing in 25 games through the last four years and 65 over the last seven, Miami has retained him year-after-year for his supporting role on the sideline and in the locker room.  Checking in three minutes into the game, the 42-year-old was applauded as the fifth-oldest player to make an NBA game appearance. That accomplishment set the tone for a memorable first quarter, which saw Haslem record 13 points ‚Äî more than he had scored in a game since 2015. With three minutes left in the first, his trademark jumper electrified the crowd.

Haslem's story of impact and longevity is unique and fans in the arena recognized that.

"Short answer is I'm going to miss him," he said. "But he's not going anywhere, it's just going to be a different role. And I think he'll find a way to make this role even more impactful than what he's done now. He's already done that five or six times over the course of his career, it will be a reinvention and he'll find a way to move the needle."
