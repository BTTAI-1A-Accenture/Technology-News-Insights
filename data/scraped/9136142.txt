We’ve reported before that a major growth driver in the cybersecurity industry is the fact that cyber-attacks are consistently growing across the globe. Companies are thus wracked by a sense of anxiety regarding the security of their data, which makes them likelier to invest in better, and often more expensive, cybersecurity products and services. This anxiety then translates into profits for cybersecurity companies, enabling them to consistently grow their revenues and profits. According to a Nasdaq Investment Intelligence report, the total number of major cyber-attacks reported globally was higher in almost every month of 2020 compared to the same months in 2019 and 2018. Of the attacks in 2020, 40% were carried out using malware and 15% through account hijacking. With this growing trend of cyber-attacks, especially those targeting American businesses, the US government considered cybersecurity an important national security issue. Resultantly, the Biden administration released its National Cybersecurity Strategy this March to make the American digital ecosystem safer for all. The strategy is built on the foundation of five pillars: defending critical infrastructure, disrupting and dismantling threat actors, shaping market forces to drive security and resilience, investing in a resilient future, and forging international partnerships to pursue shared goals. With increased governmental support for the cybersecurity sector, companies operating in this sector, like CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD), Fortinet, Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NYSE:PANW) are set to benefit and reach new highs. According to a McKinsey report published in October, around $150 billion were spent on cybersecurity in 2021, representing a growth of 12.4% annually. McKinsey estimates that at this rate, the cybersecurity sector represents a total addressable market of $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. In such an environment, cybersecurity stocks are steadily becoming high-priority investments. This is why we have compiled a list of the top cybersecurity growth stocks to invest in today. Den Rise/Shutterstock.com Let’s now take a look at the top 10 growth stocks in cybersecurity.

These stocks have year-over-year revenue growth rates above 25%, and these revenue growth rates are among the highest in the cybersecurity sector. The stocks are ranked on the basis of these revenue growth rates, from the lowest to the highest rate. We have also used Insider Monkey’s hedge fund data for the fourth quarter, when 943 hedge funds were tracked, to show the popularity of these stocks among elite hedge funds today.

In addition to rate hikes compressing the multiples of longerduration, high growth companies, recession concerns were also a headwind. IT companies which had proven resilient against customer budget reductions earlier in the year are starting to feel the impact of spending slowdowns as companies further scrutinize expenses in light of economic uncertainty. For example, Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW), which provides enterprise security solutions including next-generation firewalls and threat detection software, faced a challenging environment as customers delayed purchases and orders. However, we remain convinced of the company’s long-term growth prospects as an industry leader in a critical field and as digital attacks and ransomware continue to grow.” Palo Alto Networks, Inc.

Rapid7 is a software company focused on enterprise cybersecurity. The company reported a mixed second quarter, meeting expectations for revenues and margins. The management team’s commentary was cautious however, as they stated that the current macro environment is leading to an elongated sales cycle, particularly in Europe. Also an important segment of their offerings, Vulnerability Management, is showing a modest growth deceleration. Overall the entire software sector is under pressure as valuation is being compressed across the board. Given that cybersecurity software companies still have the best visibility within the software industry going forward, and since we want to maintain some software exposure within the portfolio, we are maintaining our position in Rapid7.” Revenue Growth Over the Past Year as of March 9: 32.17% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47 Fortinet, Inc.

Splunk is a premium product, and less expensive alternatives have made progress increasing the quality of their offerings. Our research has confirmed Splunk is losing market share to these players, including Microsoft’s Sentinel. Sentinel has made a number of improvements over time and integrates with Microsoft’s other products. Notably, both of Splunk’s Co-Presidents left Splunk in 2022 to work for Microsoft. Splunk’s Chief Financial Officer left a few months later. Before the CFO left, Splunk lowered its annual recurring revenue guidance for the year. While the company attributed the change to the macro environment, we were unable to differentiate to what extent the slowdown was caused by the macro environment versus competitive factors. Based on our primary research and competitive concerns, we no longer had sufficient confidence in Splunk’s value stability. Splunk no longer qualifies for investment, and we exited the position.”  Revenue Growth Over the Past Year as of March 9: 42.92% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59 Okta, Inc.
