     Move over, malls. The retail industry is trying to make livestream shopping fetch. Poshmark and others are setting up live platforms, where consumers can bid on clothing for sale (in real time), all from the comfort of their phones. The move comes as other retailers, like Amazon and Walmart, bet on the future of shopping via phones, with the U.S. estimated to take in $32 million in sales this year alone, according to data from Coresight Research. "There’s just an insane level of excitement that we have seen,” Poshmark's CEO tells The New York Times.    Tell us, have you tried out live shopping for clothes? Please share your thoughts in the comments.

             Almost as soon as this article from the #nytimes posted this morning about #liveshopping, my inbox was inundated with colleagues and brands asking my opinion.  

From the 18 months I spent as the CSO of Revo Video, I have a few nuggets that I can share.  I've split these into two groups #brands and #mediacompanies 

Brands
Setting up a live shopping event is not a tactic but a strategy.  Meaning that you need to plan for it - the promotional campaign to drive consumers to the #event, securing the right #creator or #influencer to host (remember #celebs are great but they don't always drive sales nor are they good hosts), ensuring the #promotion or product launch is timed correctly for the market and the length of the program.  In other words, planning is essential.

While a live event may seem complex, remember that when it's over you will not only have sold products, but also gather direct consumer data and feedback via polls and chat, review analytics from a show to pinpoint when sales or activation spiked, and assess how that creator performed.  In addition, that live video can now be cut into short form content for further promotion across your media platforms.

Second - Start small, wash, rinse and repeat.  Using a platform like Revo Video you can leverage existing video content and make it shoppable in 5 minutes.  This enables a brand to test out messaging, creator and content before building a live show format. 

Media Companies
For media companies with libraries of existing content a shoppable platform is an excellent opportunity to take a show or segment of a show with product and extend that content to make it shoppable.  Use the content library that you already own and create new ways to engage consumers (and enhance your brand relationships) by offering something unique while creating a new #revenue stream.  

Using a company like Clipmedia.ai that through AI and ML can search your entire catalog of content, #curate the correct clips and make them available for shoppable platforms.   This platform works for both TV and movies and the clips can be used for #socialsharing and even #gamification.

From the overall media perspective there were no less than 5 companies at the #iabnewfronts last week that showcased and talked about shoppable content - from the biggest #networks  and #streamers  to social platforms and just about everyone in between.  

While the U.S. is still evolving in the shoppable arena,  there is a tremendous opportunity and a low barrier to entry to start now, test and learn, and get a jump on your competitors because this isn't going away anytime soon.

             The future of fashion is in your closet. Super excited to see this story live: a closer look at Poshmark's (and others) foray into the US's nascent live shopping market. Live shows are an amazing way to shop secondhand: you can see items on live video, ask sellers questions, find unique / vintage items, and support an individual seller making a living through resale. #recommerce #secondhand https://lnkd.in/enKbeS-s

             Shopping as entertainment is proving to have a limited shelf life. We've all been there...flipping through channels to appease our need to fill up empty entertainment space or simply going through our night owl routine when we come across QVC or HSN. We're pulled in by the latest  "it cooks itself" appliance or the "you too can look like a model" jewelry. Live shopping is the latest iteration where people buy and sell products in real time over video, but much more interactive. While live shopping is big overseas, the medium has yet to catch on here in the U.S. Is it really all its cracked up to be?

Part of the thrill of live shopping (if you will) is this. When the host is an influencer with a big fan base, there’s that extra thrill of being acknowledged, and it’s probably the closest thing most fans will get to having a direct conversation. That can be a late boost regardless of whether your pajamas match. 

Retailers have certainly become much more innovative and focused on the customer experience. We've seen it with traditional brick-and-mortars building a more unified and integrated approach that ties into their ecommerce strategies. Live shopping is the next frontier in the U.S., but for all the success the medium has experienced in Asia, that requires some context.

Live shopping has posted big growth gains in China, but even in the context of China’s eCommerce numbers, it’s small. In 2021, livestream shopping was $327 billion in China, reflecting 108% growth, on top of 220% growth the year before. That’s about 10% of the ecommerce market in China, and much of that may have been pandemic driven from lock downs. And even there, growth may have plateaued. The other considerations are that revenue tends to focus on a limited set of products (keep in mind, you're only featuring one or two things at a time), and higher return rates (what looked like a good buy at 2am doesn't look so good the next day). 

For retailers, the challenge (as always) will be developing engaging content that keeps customers coming back. Live shopping is no different. If anything, content is an even bigger king, and that requires huge investment. As for U.S. shoppers, live shopping hasn't taken off yet, and whether our chase for immediate gratification will eventually get us there remains a question https://lnkd.in/ga8SbZ6i #shopping #consumers #influencermarketing #ecommerce #liveshopping #retail

             Is live shopping a new way of purchasing for consumers? 

With Amazon Live, Poshmark & TikTok buying in, will more retailers move to the new way of shopping? 

Investors poured more than $380 million into livestream e-commerce companies in the United States last year, up from $36 million in 2020, according to PitchBook.

 Of course it works! Live shopping is in our human DNA…it’s as old as we are. The Agora…fairs….shuk…..QVC….and now streaming….nothing has changed just the channel
