 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GraphQL innovation leader Hasura today announced that it has successfully achieved Google Cloud Ready - AlloyDB designation for AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, Google Cloud’s newest fully managed PostgreSQL-compatible database service for the most demanding enterprise database workloads.
  
Google Cloud Ready - AlloyDB is a new designation for the solutions of Google Cloud’s technology partners that integrate with AlloyDB. This designation recognizes the partner solutions that have met a core set of functional requirements and validated them in collaboration with Google Cloud engineering teams. Hasura has closely collaborated with Google Cloud to include support for AlloyDB into its GraphQL API solutions and tune existing functionality for optimal outcomes.
 
“Hasura’s platform provides helpful capabilities for developers working with data, and we’re delighted to recognize Hasura’s platform with a Google Cloud Ready - AlloyDB designation,” said Ritika Suri, Director, Partnerships at Google Cloud. “This designation indicates that customers can seamlessly and effectively integrate Hasura with AlloyDB and begin connecting their data sources using GraphQL data APIs.”
