   on February 23, 2023 at 1:01PM PST Sony Pictures has released a new red band trailer for The Machine, a film that adapts comedian Bert Kreischer's real-life story about an encounter with the Russian mafia. For anyone just catching up, Kreischer got famous, in part, for his story about visiting Russia in college, drinking too much vodka, and getting mixed up with the wrong people. This real-life story, which included his new Russian pals calling him "The Machine" for his drinking prowess, made Kreischer famous and he's been performing the story on stage as part of his routine for years. The movie takes place 23 years after the story that inspired it, with an aged Kreischer getting tracked down and kidnapped, along with his father played by Mark Hamill, by the Russian mob and brought back to the motherland to pay for his crimes. "Together, he and his father must retrace the steps of his younger self (Jimmy Tatro) in the midst of a war between a sociopathic crime family while they attempt to find common ground," reads a line from the film's description. Kreischer leaked the first trailer for The Machine in November during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. The film has reportedly been ready to go for a long time now, but Sony Pictures held off due to the war between Russia and Ukraine. The Machine is directed by Peter Atencio, who previously made Keanu starring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
