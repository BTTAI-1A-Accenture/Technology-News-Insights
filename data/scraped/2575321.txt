 If you haven't seen them in your local street or park, the chances are that cherry blossoms may have popped up your social media feeds this past week. Herbert Park has the highest population of cherry blossoms in Dublin, and its tree-lined paths are currently bursting with pink and white blooms, making it an Instagrammer's delight. Debbie Eguia travelled with her friend from Drogheda, Co Louth to visit the park. "We've been researching which area in Dublin has a good park to take photos of cherry blossoms and Herbert Park is the best one. We’ve been waiting for this for a long time now," she said. In Ireland, cherry blossoms can bloom as early as March, with the 'season' typically in full swing between April and May. In the UK, gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society have said that last year's heatwave followed by a cold early February set the trees up for peak condition blooms this spring. Chris Balamban travelled to Herbert Park from Co Kildare to take photographs of the trees under perfect blue skies. "In this season, they are lovely. In full bloom, they are beautiful," he said. Cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan, where they symbolise spring, renewal and the fleeting nature of life.
