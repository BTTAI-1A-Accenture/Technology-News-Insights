Reviewed Updated: Aug 16, 2024, 3:39pm Mailchimp is a wildly popular email marketing software, but with its arbitrary rules and lengthy customer service response times, it isn’t perfect. Forbes Advisor has put together a list of the best Mailchimp alternatives for 2024. To come up with this list, Forbes Advisor compared dozens of contenders across thousands of data points. These include pricing, features, the availability of a free plan and user reviews.

 Yes, with the Standard Plan (starting at $3 per month) Zoho Campaigns is one of the best Mailchimp alternatives when it comes to value for price. Along with Mailchimp, Zoho Campaigns offers a free forever plan. Where the two differ is that Zoho’s free plan is limited to 6,000 emails per month—which is far more than Mailchimp’s free plan at 1,000 per month. However, Zoho’s free plan has a contact limit of 2,000—which is 500 more contacts than Mailchimp’s limit of 500 contacts. Similar to Mailchimp, it offers users an easy-to-use drag-and-drop template editor and a library of pre-designed, responsive newsletter templates. It also has a basic template layout that makes it easy to create newsletters. Email marketing is unlimited with Zoho Campaigns and you can also do A/B testing. Its robust features also include contact management, segmentation of mailing lists, bulk segments, customizable sign-up and pop-up forms and topics. You can also score contacts and personalize emails with Zoho Campaigns. Built-in workflow templates and autoresponders make email marketing automation easy. Who should use it: Zoho Campaigns is the best Mailchimp alternative for small businesses and entrepreneurs who have large contact lists. For example, businesses with 10,000 contacts will pay $100 per month for a Mailchimp plan and just $36.75 per month with Zoho Campaigns.

 Brevo, formerly known as Sendinblue, is an email marketing tool that offers a lot of features for free, including SMS marketing, email templates, a chatbot and unlimited contacts. What makes it unique is that its free plan includes unlimited contacts, but with the caveat that it only includes up to 300 emails per day.

However, the daily limit makes it geared towards businesses with large, but highly segmented lists and frequent email sends. It also has a number of built-in marketing features such as a workflow editor and page tracking. Its paid plans offer even more features, such as no daily sending limit, Facebook ads integration, advanced segmentation and priority support.

Sendinblue’s segmentation tool also makes it easy to search for a specific contact and manage tags.

Pros Cons Mailchimp offers four pricing plans, including a free option. The free plan allows for up to 1,000 monthly email sends and one user.

Consider choosing a competitor over Mailchimp if you require more robust website building features, advanced e-commerce capabilities or a platform tailored to specific industries or niches.
