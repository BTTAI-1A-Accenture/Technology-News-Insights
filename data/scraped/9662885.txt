Damian Lillard is “amazed,” but maybe not in a good way. After an eventful day in the Lillard trade request saga where the guard’s agent, Aaron Goodwin, was reportedly telling teams not to trade for him in hopes of getting him to go to Miami, Lillard took to Twitter to express his apparent feelings on the situation in a cryptic pair of messages on Thursday. “I’m amazed,” Lillard wrote in the first tweet. After a reply by the Portland radio station 750 The Game asking the seven-time All-Star why, he responded by saying “at how ppl could know so much and so little at the same time.” After Lillard announced he wanted a trade out of Portland, sources around the league, including ESPN’s Marc Spears, said that the All-NBA guard was looking to join the Miami Heat exclusively. “Damian Lillard wants to play for Miami and only Miami, I have been continually told since Saturday,” Spears said. A trade between the Heat and Trail Blazers alone would be challenging for the reigning Eastern Conference champs, as they have limited assets and draft capital to appease a team that has one of the NBA’s 75 greatest players ever still in his prime. Luckily for Miami, there are “several” teams according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski that would be willing to part ways with a “good first-round pick” plus “maybe something more” in exchange for Miami guard Tyler Herro to help facilitate a three-team trade – a team like the San Antonio Spurs has been heavily rumored to be in the mix. Spears also reported that Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum, a former teammate of Lillard’s during their run with Team USA in the 2020 Olympics, has been pushing for the team to trade for Lillard despite the Miami-only request.
