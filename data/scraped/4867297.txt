Newsboy's nap Haku runs at Kempton on Friday evening, where his other top tip, Aramis Grey, is gunning for a third win in four outings HAKU looks good to follow up a last-time-out course-and-distance score as he takes on seven rivals for the Unibet Horserace Betting Operator Of The Year Apprentice Handicap (5.15) at Kempton Park today. A step up to a mile and a half has seen the Mark Loughnane-trained three-year-old - Haku was in the care of John Butler for his first five visits to the track - take a step forward on his last two outings. The son of Dragon Pulse marked his first try at the trip with a neck second to Hammy End at Southwell in the middle of last month. And 12 days later Haku went one better – he secured a first career victory at the ninth attempt in the process – with a two-and-three-quarter-length margin over Longclaw at this afternoon’s venue. The handicapper’s reaction was to put my selection up 5lb to a new British Horseracing Authority rating of 70. But Haku, ridden by the trainer’s son Billy – the 7lb claimer has been in red-hot form despite the cold snap – still has more to offer at middle distances and is strongly fancied to go in again.  Later on the Kempton card, ARAMIS GREY has strong claims of registering a third win from his last four starts in the Unibet Handicap (7.45).
