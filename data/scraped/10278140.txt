Our caffeine-addicted genes love a bit of Starbucks magic, every now and then. Besides, we have an amazing piece of news, which is definitely going to push your admiration for this prominent coffee chain. Thus, keep reading to know about the latest 'free refill at Starbucks' move. This uber-famous coffee franchise spread across India, has finally launched its FREE coffee refill campaign at select stores in Mumbai. Yep, you read that right! Starbucks is now giving out one free refill on core beverages, and we couldn't be happier. Drinks on which the offer is available are Cold Brew Black, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Brew, Ice Latte and Ice Americano. But here’s the catch - you need to spend more than one hour to avail the offer, and it is applicable before 2:00 PM. So if you’re someone who loves to work at coffee shops, especially Starbucks, but avoids it mostly due to high pricing, here's is your golden ticket. Thus, now you can get your money’s worth and sip away a yummy, rich cup of Starbucks coffee, twice *wink*!  The offer is now applicable at 26 stores across Mumbai. Locations of these stores are Panchpakhadi - Thane, Korum, Viviana, Viviana Mall 2, The Walk, Hiranandani Meadows, Runwal Greens, CBD Belapur 2, Mahavir Nagar, RM Bhattad Road, Commerz II, Borivali West, Chandavarkar Road, Shivaji Park, New Cuff Parade, Sion Beau Monte, Infiniti Andheri, Silver Springs Building, X Cube, Oshiwara, Samarth Vaibhav Oshiwara, Oberoi Mall and Kabra Metro. Besides Mumbai, this offer is now available at select Starbucks outlets across Pune, Delhi NCR and Hyderabad.
