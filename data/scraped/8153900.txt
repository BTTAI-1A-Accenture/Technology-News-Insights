     It’s the final day of Heart Show Me The Money 2023. You can play Heart Show Me The Money on the Heart Network across England and Wales*, or on Heart UK – available across Great Britain on DAB, through your TV and on Global Player. Between 8:00am and 4:00pm, you are listening for the SHOW ME THE MONEY SONG! You’ll know when you hear it because it’ll start like this… How to recognise the Heart Show Me The Money song!  When you hear that – you need to text in to try to win the money. We’ll then randomly select someone to come on air, and if that’s you, you’ve got a big decision to make! You can either keep that daily cash prize, or you can turn it down and shout HEART SHOW ME THE MONEY! If you do, we’ll then reveal a NEW amount that you’ll win instead. That amount will either be HIGHER than the daily cash prize – all the way up to £50,000 – OR, it could be an amount that is LOWER. Today, Friday 21st July, you could win £12,000.  When YOU hear the SHOW ME THE MONEY SONG - text the word MONEY and the NAME OF THE ARTIST to 82122! Texts cost £2 plus your standard network rate. Once the song starts, you’ll have 10 minutes to enter, if you text after that – you won't be entered but you may still be charged. You must be 18 or over and live in Great Britain to play this Heart Network game. All the rules and online entry details can be found here. *This competition doesn’t run on Heart Scotland. If you live in Scotland and would like to enter, please tune in to Heart UK instead. See more More Competitions
