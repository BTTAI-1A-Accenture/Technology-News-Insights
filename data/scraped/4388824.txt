Ever since the Marvel Universe was born with the publication of Fantastic Four #1 in 1961, the worlds of Marvel and DC have been evolving in parallel. That has inevitably led to certain mirror images appearing in comics and on  screen.  Many of those characters underline the various creative and structural links between the two universes, and how that’s shaped the history of superhero fiction as we now know it.  With DC Studios co-head James Gunn recently unveiling his ambitious first chapter of film and TV projects known as “Gods And Monsters,”  comparisons between the MCU and DCU will of course keep growing—but where are the strongest character links right now? Let’s take a closer look. From strident defenders of humanity to complex antiheroes, these are the DC and Marvel heroes who match up most closely in their journeys from the comics page to the silver screen. Who Came First: Often recognized as the prototype for all comic book superheroes who came after him, Superman arrived from creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in the spring of 1938. Captain America arrived from creators Joe Simon and Jack Kirby almost exactly three years later in the spring of 1941, punching Hitler in the face on his very first comics cover.What They Share: Though their power sets are remarkably different, and they’re technically different species, Superman and Captain America are linked by shared values, shared roles within their respective teams, and a shared sense of working as the moral compass of their respective superhero universes. Though often treated as a living god even within the DCEU, it’s Superman’s humanity which stands out, while Captain America’s status as a “Super Soldier” is never more important than his innate hatred of bullies and sense of steadfastness. Throw in the matching color schemes, and they’re linked by quite a lot. GET A.V.CLUB RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX Pop culture obsessives writing for the pop culture obsessed.
