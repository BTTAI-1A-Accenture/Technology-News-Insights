AKWESASNE, N.Y. (WCAX) -The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe is trying to better protect the rights of members to fish in Akwesasne’s territorial waters. In 2014, the Non-Member Fishing Regulations and Law was amended in collaboration with tribal fishermen to strengthen the protection of Akwesasne’s natural resources. Now, there are proposed amendments, including establishing a season for Non-Members to fish in Akwesasne’s territorial waters, setting catch limits, as well as increasing fishing permit fees. The first meeting to talk about the proposals is Wednesday the 18th. Copyright 2023 WCAX. All rights reserved.
