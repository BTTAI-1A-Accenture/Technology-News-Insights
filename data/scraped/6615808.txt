     SHARE A man repeatedly ordering a large amount of liquor from BevMax in Fairfield County was nabbed for larceny and credit card fraud, Eric Chau  The incident took place in Westport on Wednesday, May 31. According to Lt. Eric Woods, with the Westport Police, officers spoke with a delivery person from Instacart who reported he became increasingly suspicious of orders he was receiving for delivery to a person in a car in front of a home under construction on George Street. The delivery person reported they had made several high-dollar deliveries of liquor to this person in their car, Woods said. Officers spoke with the person, identified as Eric Chau, age 24, of Brooklyn, and it was obvious to the officers that he was very nervous. He had no good reason for parking 300 yards away from the store and making several high-dollar liquor purchases to be delivered.  In speaking with employees at the store they noted that each of the orders was made with different credit card numbers and the credit card numbers were not associated with Chau, Woods said. Woods said police believe Chau was either making the purchases online using fraudulent credit cards or was simply the person responsible for accepting the deliveries and bringing them back to New York City.  Either way, he was arrested and charged with larceny and credit card fraud and released after posting a $5,000 bond.  Chau is set to appear in court on Thursday, June 8 in Stamford.
