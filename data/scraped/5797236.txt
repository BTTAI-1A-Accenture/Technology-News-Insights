 Well, there he is. Conker the king. Rareâ€™s decidedly not family-friendly squirrel is back in merchandise form thanks to Fangamer. Theyâ€™d already handled Banjo-Kazooie with gusto, and now our other favorite ex-Diddy Kong racer is getting his turn. Â  This isn't just a Conker plush. This is a @Fangamer Conker plush with brand new voice lines recorded by @conkerhimself. Will also probably drink any beer you have in the house. ðŸ‘‘ https://t.co/yV8TYFSxQW pic.twitter.com/vk4M0WTauI â€” Rare Ltd. (@RareLtd) September 22, 2020  Â  The main attraction is a plush of Conker himself, complete with removable crown accessory. This is no garden variety plush though, as this raunchy rodent actually talks! Conkerâ€™s original voice actor (and game designer) Chris Seavor has recorded new voice clips for this extra special merch. Â   Â  Along with the plush comes a new pin of Conker, capturing his glare (and regrets) from the gameâ€™s intro video. If thatâ€™s a little too brooding for you, you can go the other way and pick up a Cock and Plucker pint and shot glass set, evoking the bar where Conker drowns his sorrows. Last but not least is a Conker shirt, perfectly modeled after old Spuds McKenzie ads to bring us the Original Party Squirrel. Â  Â  Collect yourself a handful of (preferably googly-eyed) cash because all four of these new pieces of official Conker merch are available now. Â  When he isnâ€™t writing for Nintendo Wire, Rickyâ€™s anticipating the next Kirby, Fire Emblem, or if the stars ever align, Mother 3 to be released. Till then heâ€™ll have the warm comfort of Super Smash Bros. to keep him going.
