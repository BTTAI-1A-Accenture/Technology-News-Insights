		 The Ukrainian army has released footage from a drone delivering water supplies to civilians trapped by major flooding following the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam in Kherson. Ukrainians can be seen hanging out of windows and clinging to boats as flood waters rush around them. In one clip, a boy can be seen hanging out of a window before he is saved by catching a bottle of water dropped from the drone by rescue workers. In a separate video, he was seen being taken from his flooded home to a waiting boat filled with other fleeing Ukrainians and their pet dog. The family that was given water by a drone in flooded Oleshky managed to evacuate! Such a news! Meanwhile, the news is coming about people who drown in the occupied Kherson reg. #StandWithUkraine pic.twitter.com/hsOtnQYpuo Later the boy can be seen embracing one of the soldiers who helped to rescue him. The footage is similar to clips released by Ukraine showing drones dropping grenades on Russian positions. The Nova Kakhovka dam collapse on Tuesday came as Ukraine prepared to launch a major counteroffensive to recapture territory occupied by Russian forces. The incident will likely be the biggest man-made disaster in Ukraine since the Chornobyl nuclear crisis. Around 600 sq km of Ukraine’s southern Kherson region remained underwater on Thursday, 68 per cent of which are located on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River, the regional governor said on Thursday. Oleksandr Prokudin wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the average water level as of Thursday morning was 5.61 metres. Ukraine said the deluge would leave hundreds of thousands of people without access to drinking water, swamp tens of thousands of hectares of agricultural land and turn at least 500,000 hectares deprived of irrigation into “deserts”.
