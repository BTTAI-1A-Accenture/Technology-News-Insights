MDIs such as Hispanic American-owned banks help fight economic inequality by providing financial services such as banking and lending to underserved communities. Business Insider's personal finance team made a list of every Hispanic American-owned bank and several Hispanic American-owned credit unions by state so you can find a Hispanic American-owned financial institution that fits your needs.

Hispanic American-owned banks and credit unions were created to provide services to low-income and minority communities, particularly Hispanic American communities. Historically, Hispanic Americans have been affected by discriminatory lending practices like redlining, where loan services would be systemically denied for certain predominantly Black and Hispanic American neighborhoods, and experienced limited economic opportunities to build wealth. Hispanic American banks were founded in areas where minority communities lived. These financial institutions were able to connect with their local communities and fill the banking gap by addressing areas like language and culture. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the government began to develop programs and policies that could aid minority-owned banks and allow these institutions to continue serving underrepresented communities. For instance, through Executive Order 11625, the government sought to establish a program that would strengthen minority banks, such as Hispanic American-owned banks.  Legislation such as the Community Reinvestment Act also helped address the needs of underrepresented communities by requiring banks to meet their needs through services and products. Hispanic American-owned banks, much like other minority-owned banks, have gone through periods of growth and periods of decline. In general, the number of FDIC-recognized Hispanic American-owned banks has been on the decline since around 2014. That being said, the financial assets of those banks have risen in the same time period. Today, there are 55 Hispanic American-owned banks and credit unions that are FDIC or NCUA insured around the United States. These financial institutions continue to serve low-income and underrepresented communities.

Kashian, an economics professor at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater and director of the Fiscal and Economic Research Center, has studied the role of heritage among Hispanic American-owned banks. Some of Kashian's research has found that Hispanic American-owned banks are culturally diverse. Depending on their Hispanic heritage and what their communities' specific needs are, these businesses can relate to the culture and support their needs economically.  In our list of Hispanic American-owned banks and credit unions, many of the institutions listed offer customer support in Spanish and English. You'll also see that they have international banking or transfer services, which can be ideal for people who need to send money to their families if they live in another country, says Kashian. A few of the Hispanic American-owned banks on our list, like River City Credit Union and Guadalupe Credit Union, tackle issues of citizenship status by working with the national program Juntos Avanzamos. Juntos Avanzamos allows bank members to use foreign identification to open a bank account if they aren't U.S. citizens, which helps banks with immigrant and U.S. non-citizen customers. It also offers products that allow individuals to build credit. Kashian also says that minority-owned businesses also have a purpose beyond their services and products.  "It is providing a vision for young people on what they can do with their lives," said Kashian. "The other important thing is that it provides job opportunities within a community and entry-level jobs."  When it comes to minority depository institutions, Kashian says that several train and promote within, creating a funnel toward leadership positions and banking that reflects its community. According to 2023 research conducted by the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute, Latino and Black applicants were also less likely to be approved for a conventional loan compared to white and Asian applicants. Furthermore, when they are approved, they are more likely to be offered a high-cost loan or denied a mortgage. Pablo DeFilippi, executive vice president of the Inclusiv Network, also points out that often Latino immigrants do not have a credit record, and because of that, they experience disadvantages in receiving certain banking products and services.  "They're not given the opportunity to build it, it's almost like a Catch-22. The banks can't give you a loan because you don't have a credit history, but you can't have a credit history without a loan," adds DeFilippi. Hispanic American-owned banks and credit unions are vital for minority communities. As minority depository institutions, Hispanic American-owned banks serve an integral role for minority communities and help underrepresented individuals fulfill their economic needs. In 2019, the FDIC released a study that analyzed how MDIs serve minority, low- and moderate-income communities. Results from the study found that Hispanic Americans made up a greater percentage of those who took out home loans or small business loans at Hispanic American banks in comparison to non-minority banks. There are 30 Hispanic American-owned banks in the United States. There are also over 20 credit unions with over 10,000 members that are Hispanic American-led institutions. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and International Bank of Commerce are two of the largest Hispanic American-owned banks in the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico has over 130 branches and more than 55 free ATMs. International Bank of Commerce has over 163 branches and more than 256 ATMs. MDI institutions offer many of the same accounts and services that larger banking institutions offer. You can open up savings accounts, checking accounts, CDs, and money market accounts in most of the institutions listed. You can also get a loan or an individual retirement account. Some even offer business banking or international banking services. Anyone can bank at a Hispanic American-owned bank. However, something you'll need to factor in is where you live. Most Hispanic American-owned banks on our list are located in select states. There aren't any Hispanic American-owned banks with a national presence.

If you're curious about more historical information about Hispanic American-owned banks and other MDIs, you can also visit the FDIC webpage or read some of the research listed on the Partnership of Progress website. Throughout history, Hispanic American-owned banks have gone through times of growth and times of decline. Hispanic American-owned banks, similar to other MDIs, have been impacted during periods when the economy is hit hardest. For instance, during the 2008 recession, Hispanic American-owned banks had more closures than openings. In 2001, the FDIC had 32 Hispanic American-owned banks on its MDI list. In 2011, the number of Hispanic American-owned banks increased to 38, and now in 2024, it's gone down to 30. Business Insider chose Hispanic American banks from the FDIC's fourth quarter 2023 list. These banks are designated as "minority depository institutions" (MDIs) and FDIC insured. FDIC-insured banks protect your money and make sure that up to $250,000 is backed up in an individual bank account.  According to the FDIC, an MDI is defined as "a federal insured depository institution for which (1) 51 percent or more of the voting stock is owned by minority individuals; or (2) a majority of the board of directors is minority and the community that the institution serves is predominantly minority."  We selected Hispanic American-owned credit unions from the National Credit Union Administration's list of minority depository institutions which was also updated in September 2023. The NCUA has a slightly different definition for MDIs.  For a credit union to be an MDI it must be federally insured and "a majority of its current members, its board of directors, and the community it services, as designated in its charter, fall within any of the eligible minority groups." Minority groups considered are Black Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, or Asian Americans.  From the NCUA's Minority Depository Institutions List, we selected Hispanic American-owned credit unions that had at least 10,000 members. If our list doesn't include a banking institution that's near you, you may be able to find a smaller credit union on this list. Jump to
