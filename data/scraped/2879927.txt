  In a global survey of 200 business leaders who purchase software for their 500+ employee companies, Storyblok found that only 1% said customer reviews are of low importance when choosing software. All of that research pays off because 94% said customer reviews match their experience using software all the time or most of the time. As champions of exceptional user experience, Storyblok recently announced it was named a Customers’ Choice in the March 2023 Gartner Peer Insights “Voice of the Customer”: Web Content Management. Storyblok was the only vendor named a Customers’ Choice in the report, with 88% of customers willing to recommend it. Says Dominik Angerer (above), co-founder and CEO of Storyblok: “Focusing on the needs of our customers is at the heart of everything we do at Storyblok. We believe being recognised as the only vendor that’s a Customers’ Choice is a massive honor, but it’s also a responsibility we take very seriously. We’re committed to making sure our customers feel this way about us for many years to come.” As part of its efforts to continue providing an excellent customer experience, Storyblok also recently revealed a new ROI calculator to help businesses see the economic impact that’s possible with modernised content management.
