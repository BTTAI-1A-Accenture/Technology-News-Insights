The Met Office has put out a yellow weather warning for freezing fog and patches of ice which is likely to lead to some slow or difficult journeys on Sunday night and Monday morning.

Additionally, snowfall that is now easing near and over the Cotswolds, as well as isolated showers elsewhere may lead to some ice developing on untreated surfaces.  "Although becoming less widespread and thick by lunchtime, some places may be affected by fog for the remainder of the day, particularly in Northern Ireland and northern England." The temperature fell to -7C in Katesbridge, Co Down, on Saturday night and it is expected to fall even lower in some places tonight.
