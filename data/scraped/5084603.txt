 Nestled near the charming old harbour of Faro and overlooking the Eva Hotel, A Fábrica is a hip burger restaurant that promises a delightful culinary experience. Upon arrival, the inviting front terrace catches the eye, but due to the sweltering heat and the absence of an umbrella, we opt for the cool interior. Hanna is a very friendly waitress.   The interior design of A Fábrica is impressive with its unique blend of industrial elements and aged wooden accents. The bar, adorned with numerous drawers, exudes an old-world charm that complements the contemporary aesthetic. Venture upstairs to discover another stylish bar/restaurant area and well-appointed restrooms, showcasing the owners' keen eye for beautiful design.  They produce everything themselves, from burgers to sandwiches, which is why the name is A Fábrica, which means factory in Portuguese. Unfortunately, there are no gluten-free options at the moment, but they are working on that.   Owned by two enterprising brothers, Raphael Marques and Renato Marques, A Fábrica originally began its journey in 2017 in Loulé and later expanded its reach to Faro in 2021. Now, with dreams of becoming a widespread burger chain akin to the American giant McDonald's, the ambitious duo aims to conquer Portugal through a franchise model. With Tavira and Portimão on the horizon for next year, it's evident that they are on a mission to leave a significant mark in the country's culinary landscape. For aspiring restaurateurs seeking an opportunity, A Fábrica could be an exciting venture to explore. As for the menu, A Fábrica boasts an impressive array of burger choices, with a special highlight on inclusivity with their vegan burger option.   Prices for these delectable burgers range from 7.35 to 14.90 euros, making them accessible to a diverse range of diners. To complete your meal, you have the option of pairing your burger with a side of salad, fries, or sweet potato, ensuring there's something to suit every taste preference.   Beyond burgers, A Fábrica offers a range of additional delights, including hot dogs, donuts, and milkshakes, adding a touch of variety for those craving something different. During my visit, I decided to try the Popey, a chickpea burger topped with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and wild arugula. And boy, was it a mouthwatering experience! The flavors were exquisitely balanced, and the chickpea patty itself was undoubtedly the best I've ever had. Not only did it taste amazing, but it also provided a healthy and protein-rich option, making it an ideal choice for those seeking a guilt-free indulgence.   In conclusion, A Fábrica lives up to its claim of offering the best burgers in town. With its captivating atmosphere, dedicated owners with big dreams, and a menu that caters to various palates, it is undoubtedly a top-notch burger destination. Whether you're a burger enthusiast or simply looking for a flavorsome dining experience, A Fábrica is well worth a visit. I, for one, am already planning my return to savor more of their delicious and healthy offerings. Kudos to A Fábrica for delivering a memorable gastronomic adventure!
