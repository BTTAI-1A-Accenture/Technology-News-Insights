 Ather Energy has launched a new variant of the Ather 450X and has priced it a shade under Rs 1 lakh. This new affordable Ather 450X is kitted out with the same electric motor and battery pack and thus delivers the same 146km of the claimed range. However, this entry-level model misses out on fast charging, riding modes, connected tech, etc. The entry-level variant of the Ather 450X aims at competing with the likes of the Ola S1 Air, TVS iQube, and Ampere Primus. That said, the Ather 450 Plus has now been discontinued and makes way for this new and more affordable Ather 450X variant.  The base variant of the Ather 450X has been priced at Rs 98,079 (ex-showroom New Delhi, after FAME II and state subsidies). The electric scooter can be upgraded with more features and tech using the Pro Pack which costs an additional Rs 30,364. Ather is offering a 3-year/30,000km warranty on the base variant and the Ather 450X equipped with the Pro Pack gets a 5-year/60,000km warranty for the battery pack. Both variants are backed up by a 3-year/30,000km warranty on the vehicle and the charger. The EV is available in six colour options – True Red, Cosmic Black, Space Grey, Lunar Grey, Salt Green and Still White.  The Ather 450X mechanically remains largely unchanged and continues using the 6.2kW motor and 3.7kWh battery pack that delivers 143km of claimed range and a 90kmph top speed. The electric scooter will however not support fast charging and it could take 15 hours and 20 minutes to fully recharge the battery pack. The scooter also misses out on ride modes, park assist, hill-hold assist, Bluetooth connectivity, GPS navigation, live tracking, OTA updates, and colour display.  Ather has reserved these features for the higher variants and the purchase of the Pro Pack for an additional cost will option the EV out with all the bells and whistles for the customer. Most importantly, however, the Ather 450X with the Pro Pack can charge up much quicker at just  5 hours and 40 minutes.  The new Ather 450X base variant replaces the Ather 450 Plus electric scooter in Ather Energy’s stable. The Ather 450 Plus used to get a smaller battery pack (at 2.6kWh), less powerful electric motor, and 20km shorter range. The older Ather 450 Plus was also not available with as many colour options. Thus the new entry-level variant of the Ather 450X becomes a more solid offering than the Ather 450 Plus that it replaces.
