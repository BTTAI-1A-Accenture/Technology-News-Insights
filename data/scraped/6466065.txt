Lolita, Tokitae or Toki, the whale held and performing at the Miami Seaquarium since 1970, has died only months before she would be released to her home waters back in the ocean She became a focus for animal rights campaigners, but after enduring over 50 years of captivity, Lolita, the killer whale, has died before she was able to swim in her home waters again. The captive orca whale also known as Toki or Tokitae, was deemed the "world's loneliest" of her species. She was held at the Miami Seaquarium for over 50 years until she died on Friday, August 18, due to apparent renal issues. The 57-year-old whale exhibited signs of discomfort in recent days and despite immediate medical efforts, she could not be saved.  Her story had garnered attention from animal rights activists who wanted her freed from captivity. She had retired from performing and had not been publicly displayed recently, while plans were in motion to move her to a natural sea pen in the Pacific Northwest. The Lummi Nation, a Native American tribe, had also been working to secure her release. Here is the story of her life of hardship and solitude. For all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US Lolita was a member of L Pod among the southern resident orcas when she was captured at around four years old in 1970 and sold to oceanariums. She ended up at the Miami Seaquarium and was initially paired with a male orca named Hugo. Lolita's original name was "Tokitae," meaning "Bright day, pretty colours" in the Chinook language. However, due to her age difference with Hugo, she was renamed Lolita after the character in Nabokov's novel. She lived with Hugo for a decade before his death due to captivity-related issues. In recent years, there had been growing concern about Lolita's living conditions and calls for her to be moved back to her natal waters. In 2023, an agreement was reached between the Miami Seaquarium, The Dolphin Company (the new owner of the Seaquarium), and the non-profit organization Friends of Toki (formerly Friends of Lolita) to relocate her to an ocean sanctuary in the Pacific Northwest. The move aimed to provide a protected habitat for her remaining life and was supported by scientific experts, though her release into the wild was considered unlikely due to her long captivity. The move plan involved transporting Lolita in a custom-made stretcher via air and sea to a sea pen in her home waters. The process would take 18-24 months and cost an estimated $15-20 million, mainly funded by philanthropist Jim Irsay. The Dolphin Company and other experts were jointly working to monitor her health throughout the relocation process. Despite the challenges, the move would have been a significant step towards bettering Lolita's living conditions and emphasizing the importance of conservation efforts for marine mammals.  By 2003, animal rights groups and anti-captivity activists had already asserted that Lolita was being subjected to cruelty. A documentary titled "Lolita: Slave to Entertainment" in 2003 featured arguments against her captivity conditions, with hopes for her re-introduction to the wild expressed by activists like Ric O'Barry. On January 17, 2015, thousands of protesters gathered outside the Miami Seaquarium, demanding Lolita's release and initiating a social media campaign with the hashtag "#FreeLolita." By 2017, a USDA audit had discovered that Lolita's tank did not meet the legal size requirements according to federal law.  In 2018, the Lummi Nation visited the Seaquarium to pray for Lolita's return to the Salish Sea and brought attention to the possessive nature of settler colonialism, with Seaquarium Curator Emeritus Robert Rose responding critically to their actions. By September 24, 2020, the 50th anniversary of Lolita's arrival, tribal members of the Lummi Nation continued their efforts to support Sk'aliCh'elh-tenaut's release, exemplifying their dedication to the cause. While some experts, including Andrew Trites, argued that Lolita was too old for release into the wild, other environmental scholars maintained that such arguments reflected colonial conservation policies. In March 2023, animal rights organizations openly supported the decision regarding Lolita's move, reflecting a shift in stance. In November 2011, the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), PETA, and individuals filed a lawsuit against the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to include Lolita under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The NOAA eventually decided to provide protection under the Act. Legal actions also took place, with a judge dismissing ALDF's challenge to Miami Seaquarium's Animal Welfare Act license in 2014 and subsequent appeals against the USDA's decision in 2014. Lolita had contracted a long-term illness which resulted in a lung lesion. She was under increased veterinary care until, in July 2023, there were signs of improvement in her health, with a smaller pulmonary lesion and stable bloodwork. However, she was still battling a chronic lung infection and receiving daily medications. Lolita's diet included high-quality seafood, and her care team introduced squid to improve her gastrointestinal health. Her daily activities shifted from performing tricks to conditioning exercises to enhance her fitness. Water quality was a priority, and The Dolphin Company invested in upgrades, including an ozone generator and chillers, to regulate water temperature and mimic her natural habitat. Despite high temperatures, her pool remained at a suitable temperature.     Tragically, on August 18, 2023, Lolita passed away at the age of 57 due to renal failure. Her health had rapidly deteriorated over the preceding two days, and despite veterinary efforts, she succumbed to the illness.
