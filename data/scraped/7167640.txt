Controversial entertainment blogger Musa Khawula, is back with a bang and everyone is eating out of the palm of his hand. Musa has leveled it up as he spills his tea on a brand-new platform and Mzansi is here for his tea. From being an elusive and faceless Twitter account, Musa Khawula has unmasked and revamped his YouTube channel. A couple of months ago, Khawula’s Twitter account got suspended after he shared Lulo Cafe’s nudes. He took a break but, promised his fans that he would be back to shake things off again. While many said he was merely a clout-chase and not securing the bag from his commentary. However, Musa has since strategized on how to generate income with his no-filter commentary on the world of pop culture. His YouTube channel is slowly gaining traction as he has already garnered over 37000 subscribers, and the proof is in the pudding that he’s the next big thing, Musa calls his segment the “pope of pop culture” and he is not mincing his words with his jaw-dropping expose. He continues to wreak havoc as usual and viewers are loving his tea and how shady he gets. Tweeps have given him his flowers and praised him for his entertaining content. Musa Khawula’s tweets were something else neh but listening to him say all these things OUT LOUD ka confidence is wild👀💀😂 pic.twitter.com/yF9VjOCcTA — 👑💯 (@TheePrincess9) November 26, 2022  You guys pushed Musa Khawula out of Twitter and now he’s thriving on YouTube. Next thing we’ll see him on our TV screens becoming a Wendy Williams 😩 — TJ (@Amor_T_J) November 26, 2022  Like you can judge me, but Musa Khawula is really entertaining and I hate myself for enjoying his low brown entertainment😓 But honestly, one can’t be a militant Black soldier everyday.
Lighthearted ish is needed. Am enjoying the gossip even tho I don’t know half these celebs😂 — Former Kleva Black🇿🇦 🇿🇦 (@SneKhumaloSA) November 26, 2022  Musa Khawula is giving me Wendy Williams vibes. Love the YT channel! — Jiggy Chihera (@Taedza) November 25, 2022  Evidently, Musa does not regret leaking Lulo’s nudes. In a Twitter space titled Proof of Life, Musa said it with his chest that he would leak them again on his YouTube channel. “I don’t feel bad that the last thing I said was to look at his nudes. I’ll share them again they coming on my f*cking Youtube I don’t give a shit I still got that video I might share them on my fucking Youtube that fucking nude I didn’t say it by mistake I would do it again so that means I don’t regret anything I don’t He even took a swipe at Lulo Cafe’s nudes. “His d*ck. So small. So, I can never apologize for that. I can apologize. If you have a big d*ck, maybe I’ll owe you an apology. But if you’re shit so small and it looks so tired, I do not owe you a f*cking apology. You owe the community an apology for walking around like you got a big d*ck. Meanwhile, you got some small as sh*t. So, No, we not. Sorry. Like, I don’t give a f*ck. And one of the first videos I’m gonna share on my YouTube page will be that f*cking video. We’re back to square one. And if you go lower, I go even lower. If you go lower, I go to hell. That’s where you’re going to be. And I wasn’t arrested. I I’ve been here so long,” he said.

A point which has meant that he remains messy but lovable according to his fans and Nadia Nakai, who he recently got matching tattoos with.  The new “it couple” set tongues wagging when they confirmed that they were dating. A fact which came as a surprise for many as Nadia was close friends with media personality and ex Bonang Matheba. But similar to what Matheba allegedly did to DJ Zinhle by bricking the then pregnant female DJ to stealth AKA, Nadia proved that she can do the exact same thing to her former friend as they have even unfollowed one another.
