SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., July 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- OKX Ventures, the investment arm of the leading Web3 technology company OKX, has issued updates for July 13, 2023. 



 OKX Ventures Announces Investment in Aark Digital OKX Ventures is proud to announce its recent investment in Aark Digital, a decentralized derivatives exchange built on Arbitrum. Built for professional traders, Aark introduces features such as a new automated market maker architecture called parallel market maker (PMM) that enables the trading of 300+ pairs including super long-tail assets. PMM reflects liquidity from the order books of top centralized exchanges, making Aark more liquid than any other centralized or decentralized exchange. Aark Digital is also the first peer-to-pool derivatives DEX to introduce delta-neutral liquidity pools. These are designed to greatly enhance capital efficiency, collateral options and liquidity pool size while providing users with an experience comparable to centralized exchanges. This innovative approach to liquidity provisioning provides increased flexibility and control, allowing liquidity pools to earn delta-neutral APR while maintaining their token balance. OKX Ventures Founder Dora Yue said: "We are excited to announce this investment because the Aark team are passionate contributors to the derivatives space and are committed to creating a whole new experience for professional traders. Aark is a remarkable project for its product innovation, mechanism design and ability to reduce LP risk and increase returns." Over the past two years, OKX Ventures has invested in 300 projects across five continents with a fund size of approximately USD$1 billion, covering almost all investment tracks. OKX Ventures focuses on supporting cutting-edge blockchain innovation and exploring high-quality projects that demonstrate long-term value. It remains bullish on the ZK ecosystem, infrastructure, multi-chain and Web3 projects, and its recent investments in projects like Taiko, Berachain, Sei Network, Cetus Protocol and Alienswap reflect this emphasis.
