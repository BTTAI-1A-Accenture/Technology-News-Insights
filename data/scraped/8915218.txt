In an effort to make fares more consistent and encourage more people to use public transport, the Tasmanian government has announced changes to the bus network. Transport and Infrastructure Minister Michael Ferguson said that the changes will result in ‘almost all trips’ costing the same or less and will come into effect next week. “Fares will be based on distance, no matter where passengers travel,” Mr Ferguson said. “Ninety-nine per cent of trips statewide will cost the same or be cheaper.” “Fares will be based on ten-kilometre increments along each route, measured from the central interchanges in Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie.” He said that 95% of bus routes will stay the same and 4% will be cheaper under the new fare structure. While urban and child/student fares will remain the same statewide, adult and adult concession travel in non-urban areas will be the most affected. Daily caps, Daytripper tickets and discounts for smartcards and 10-trip tickets will not change. The change aims to address the ‘inconsistencies and confusion’ surrounding fares for trips of the same distance in different parts of the state. “Fares haven’t changed for several years, and because most fares will be the same or cheaper under the new structure, it is not designed to increase fare revenue but to encourage more people to use public transport,” Ferguson said.
