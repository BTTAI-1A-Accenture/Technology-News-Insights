 The last few months have been very hectic, yet super exciting for the KiwiQA team. Something interesting that was cooking in stealth, was made public to the torchbearers of KiwiQA. Customers, partners, and community are the three driving forces for a rapidly expanding organization like ours! When I started KiwiQA many years back, the intent was to provide exceptional QA services whereby customers can ship quality products at a faster pace! Though the ethos of the company remains unchanged, there was a pressing need for an image makeover. This is because the KiwiQA of today is significantly different from the one I started around 14 years back. Obviously on a positive note 👍 Apart from providing QA services, we invested heavily in building test frameworks (or products) that could solve customers’ problems at scale. So, how did the transformation to a product-based approach happen? The immense learnings when working closely with customers acted as valuable inputs for devising our product roadmap. You may ask which frameworks (or products) am I talking about? Let me unravel the mystery for you 🙂Our team indigenously developed frameworks like K-SPARC, K-FAST, K-ASCI, etc. that accelerate testing cycles and reduce customer feedback time. The end result - Faster Time to Market (TTM) and Improved ROI from the customer’s standpoint! So, what is the connection between the frameworks that I mentioned earlier and the image makeover that I was talking about? Time to get the cat out of the bag 😀After months of meticulous planning, development, and testing; our team launched a new website - KiwiQA.io. This website is the reflection of the in-depth expertise held by KiwiQA in different facets of testing. In stark contrast to other KiwiQA web properties, KiwiQA.io strongly focuses on QA services related to emerging sectors like Blockchain, wearable applications, AR-VR, and more. The primary goal during the website-building process was to showcase the IPs built by the KiwiQA team. They are the most resilient and hardworking team I worked with, kudos to each one of them 👏 The release of KiwiQA.io is a step to showcase the expertise of KiwiQA as an all-in-one testing services provider that is also creating innovative products that help customers ship faster. Customers in domains like Fintech, Insurance, Retail, and Telecom can get a quick glance at what QA experts at KiwiQA can bring to the table! The design aesthetics and other nuances of KiwiQA.io are similar to other websites of the KiwiQA family. This enables existing and prospective customers to connect the dots quickly when they land on any website owned by the KiwiQA group. As a founder and CEO of KiwiQA, I can proudly claim that the launch of KiwiQA.io is one of the most pivotal moments in my eventful entrepreneurial career. KiwiQA.io is not only a website, it is a game-changing moment for the KiwiQA family! The launch sends a strong signal that KiwiQA is not only here to stay but to create a further dent in the QA industry! Please root for us…Onwards & Upwards 🚀🚀 Backend Go Developer Jr. | Lead/Sr. QA Engineer Congrats!
