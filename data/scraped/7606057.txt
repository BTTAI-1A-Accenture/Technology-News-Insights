Jio Financial Services, the financial arm of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), has unsettled shadow lenders space in the country by claiming the second spot.  Post demerging with RIL on Thursday, Jio Financial Services (JFSL) boasts off an implied market capitalisation of  ₹1.6 lakh crore, that's way behind Bajaj Finance m-cap of  ₹4.59 lakh crore, but significantly higher to its contemporaries in the space. Shares of Jio Financial will remain at  ₹261.85 until it lists on the bourses. However, upon listing, Jio Financial Services will surpass Cholamandalam Investment and Finance which has an m-cap of over  ₹95,000 crore, being the second largest NBFC presently. “Jio financials is effectively valued at  ₹261.85 per share. They have roughly 620 crore shares. That values Jio financials technically at  ₹160,000 crore (roughly $20 billion),” said Deepak Shenoy, Founder, Capital Mind. “But don't go overboard, Jio Fin shares haven't actually traded. What this means is that in the Nifty, Jio Financials will be valued at  ₹160,000 cr. temporarily (until it eventually lists, when it will be removed). Oh, this will be so crazy for all the index funds when they get new inflows,” Shenoy wrote in a tweet.

JFSL’s value derived in a special pre-open session was much higher than analysts’ estimates. However, experts believe Jio Financial Services high share price is a reflection of the market’s assessment of the company's potential.  “The wide reach of JFSL through RIL’s other business segments like Reliance Retail has the potential to grow the company at a fast pace for many years to come. The market is discounting this potential,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

We expect the company to deliver higher growth given the huge opportunity in the financial sector in the country and its own strong capitalisation, which will ensure that the company would not need to raise external equity capital for a reasonably long period of time, thereby limiting any dilution overhang,” Pandey said.
