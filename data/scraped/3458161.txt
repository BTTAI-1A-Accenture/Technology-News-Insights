Published on By Chelsea legend, Gianfranco Zola has told Real Madrid to pick Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe over Manchester City’s Erling Haaland in their search for Karim Benzema’s replacement. One of Zola’s reasons is the fact that Mbappe not only scores frequently but also contributes to the attack. Real Madrid have long been linked with Haaland and Mbappe with the latter snubbing the Spanish champions to extend his deal at PSG in 2022. The La Liga champions, known for getting any player of their choice, will return to the market next month with their interests for both strikers rekindled. When asked by Diario AS which of the strikers he would advise Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sign, Zola picked the Frenchman âI think that Kylian Mbappe could be better for how he plays in the Spanish League. “There’s perhaps an attacker whosse plays is more necessary, not so much that he focuses only on the goal. “I think Kylian would adapt more to Madrid and the Spanish championship.” Champions League: Franco Zola names club to win trophy this season Champions League: I don’t pay attention – Guardiola speaks on facing Tuchel, Bayern Transfer: Iheanacho set to join LaLiga club Sevilla Transfer: Endrick breaks down in tears during Real Madrid unveiling Transfer: Endrick’s Real Madrid shirt number confirmed after Mbappe decision Transfer: I told Mbappe two things after Real Madrid move – Ancelotti Real Madrid announce contract for Llull Transfer: Real Madrid, Chelsea in talks over swapping two players Copyright Â© Daily Post Media Ltd
