 The Starlink satellites are part of the constellation being created by SpaceX to provide Internet access even in the most remote locations on the globe. SpaceX has been approved to deploy 12,000 Starlink satellites and has requested clearance for an additional 30,000. Starlink satellites deliver high-speed broadband access at relatively low latency compared to other satellite internet services, according to the company. Service is commercially available. On Aug. 27, SpaceX launched its 5,000th Starlink satellite into orbit after similarly sending 22 into space that night.
