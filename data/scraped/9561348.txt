Named “Monty,” G2’s intelligent assistant changes the way people discover software for their unique business needs
 CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--G2, the world’s largest and most trusted software marketplace, today introduced Monty, the first AI-powered business software advisor. Named after the company’s mascot, Monty the mongoose, G2’s chatbot assistant harnesses the power of OpenAI to revolutionize the way businesses find software.

  
Applying OpenAI’s ChatGPT to G2’s extensive B2B software dataset for domain-specific insights
 
G2 is already the #1 place people go for software, with the most data too — including 2 million+ verified reviews across 150,000+ products and services in 2,000+ different categories. With G2’s powerful, first-party dataset, the company is in a unique position to build this AI-powered Monty on top of it — taking the generic ChatGTP experience to a new level with domain-specific data and insights.

 
Additionally, 16% of buyers start their software purchasing journey on G2, with 74% discovering G2 during their research process. Now, Monty makes it easy to search far and wide for software on G2.com by analyzing buyer needs to suggest suitable solution options, saving time and money.

 
“The innovation coming from OpenAI opens a new world to change the way we work,” said Godard Abel, co-founder and CEO of G2. “At G2, with the largest dataset on B2B software, we have a perfect use case for ChatGPT. We’re proud to bring Monty to market to tap into this domain-specific use case to revolutionize the future of software search — guiding users with pinpoint accuracy to the ideal software solutions for their unique business needs.”

 
Taking software search to the next level: guiding buyers to more informed, faster decisions
 
G2 already differs from traditional analyst firms, whose analysts provide insights based on a limited pool of vendors they’ve consulted with. The process of partnering with an analyst to gather these software recommendations can be time-consuming and expensive too. On the other hand, G2 offers a free and self-serve approach to researching software solutions, based on verified, authentic feedback from over a million real software users.

 
Monty helps take this even further, working faster and more effective than the traditional search on G2. Rather than needing to know what you are already looking for, software buyers can input their requirements in their own voice and Monty will serve as a helpful guide. He will also provide relevant links to help users read more on the software or categories being recommended. Once they have narrowed down their list, Monty will point users to a compare page and even enable them to share lists and requirements with their team.
