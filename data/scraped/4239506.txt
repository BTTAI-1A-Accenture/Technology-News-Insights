 Mr. Tao Zou, Chief Executive Officer of Kingsoft Cloud, commented, “With our top priority remaining to achieve high-quality and sustainable development, we keep our focus on selected verticals and invest in core technologies to build our competencies and improve our efficiencies. Our execution of these strategies is well reflected in the sustained robust growth momentum of our gross profit and Non-GAAP EBITDA in the second quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, we are maintaining a high level of agility and quick response to AI trends. This quarter, we launched our Model-as-a-Service solutions to serve AI customers by providing turn-key solutions and to build secure and trusted structures to better connect Large Language Model companies and model usage companies. Looking forward, we will leverage and amplify the synergy with Xiaomi and Kingsoft Corporation ecosystem to fully embrace the opportunities in the AI trend.” Mr. Henry He, Chief Financial Officer of Kingsoft Cloud, added, “Our gross margin continued its upward trend and recorded a historical high of 11.3%, increasing for another consecutive quarter and rising by a significant 7.9 percentage points year-over-year. Within that, gross margin of public cloud services increased to 5.2% from negative 2.4% in the same period last year and gross margin of enterprise cloud services reached 21.7% from 15.3% in the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin narrowed down largely from -8.6% in the second quarter of 2022 and -7.0% last quarter to -3.3% in this quarter, demonstrating our revenue quality improvement as well as effective expense control. This quarter, we once again recorded operating cash inflow of RMB65.2 million, resulting from our enhanced management of accounts receivables and cash usage. We believe we are directing to a more balanced and healthy business structure and improving financial performance.” Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total Revenues reached RMB1,835.4 million (US$253.11 million), representing a decrease of 3.7% from RMB1,906.5 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to our proactive scale-down of services for two largest CDN customers, and phasing-out of loss-making clients. Cost of revenues was RMB1,628.8 million (US$224.6 million), representing a significant decrease of 11.5% from RMB1,841.3 million in the same quarter of 2022. We continue to enhance our cost control measures. IDC costs decreased significantly by 16.4% year-over-year from RMB1,029.1 million to RMB860.7 million this quarter. Depreciation and amortization costs decreased by 18.8% from RMB249.1 million to RMB202.1 million. Solution development and services costs decreased by 7.4% from RMB489.1 million to RMB452.9 million this quarter.

Non-GAAP gross margin2 was 11.3%, compared with 3.6% in the same period in 2022. The significant improvement in our gross profit and margin was mainly due to our strategic adjustment of revenue mix, optimized enterprise cloud project selection and efficient cost control measures, showing our strong commitment to improving our profitability and delivering high-quality and sustainable development. Within that, gross profit of public cloud services was RMB59.7 million (US$8.2 million), which was significantly improved from the gross loss of RMB30.7 million in the same period last year.

Gross margin of enterprise cloud services was 21.7%, improved from 15.3% in the same period last year. The improvement was mainly due to our more stringent enterprise cloud project selection.

General and administrative expenses were RMB246.5 million (US$34.0 million), further decreased from RMB488.6 million last quarter and RMB250.1 million in the same period in 2022. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly attributable to the high comparison base of the first quarter, which was due to long-lived assets impairment loss of public cloud asset group of RMB185.1 million and loss on disposal of property and equipment of RMB20.2 million therein, as well as our continued expense control this quarter. Research and development expenses were RMB193.9 million (US$26.7 million), slightly decreased from RMB215.4 million last quarter and RMB220.9 million in the same period in 2022, which was mainly due to the enhanced research and development efficiency and the region re-allocation of personnel in Beijing and Wuhan.

See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” set forth at the end of this press release. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). In evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP measures, Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, Non-GAAP EBITDA, Non-GAAP EBITDA margin, Non-GAAP net loss and Non-GAAP net loss margin, as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define Non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding share-based compensation allocated in the cost of revenues, and we define Non-GAAP gross margin as Non-GAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP net loss as net loss excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange loss (gain) and impairment of long-lived assets, and we define Non-GAAP net loss margin as adjusted net loss as a percentage of revenues. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as Non-GAAP net loss excluding interest income, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization, and we define Non-GAAP EBITDA margin as Non-GAAP EBITDA as a percentage of revenues. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We also believe that the use of these non-GAAP measures facilitates investors’ assessment of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. We compensate for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.
