These companies typically produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, such as automobiles, clothing, travel, and entertainment. During periods of economic growth and expansion, consumer cyclical stocks tend to perform well as consumers have more disposable income to spend on non-essential items. On the other hand, during recessions and economic downturns, consumers tend to cut back on discretionary spending, causing the performance of consumer cyclical stocks to suffer. Last year’s inflation and consistent interest rate hikes caused consumer stocks to suffer heavily, with the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index falling by 35% through December 19. This was the sector’s worst performance on record. We also reported in our previous article that consumer stocks lost nearly $1.8 trillion in market value in the first half of 2022. However, with growing consumer spending, the index gained 9.65% this year, as of March 24, compared with a 3.42% gain in the S&P 500. Consumer spending is one of the most critical components of the US economy, representing over two-thirds of the country’s GDP. The Covid pandemic of 2020 has had a significant impact on consumer spending patterns, with people spending more time at home due to restrictions on travel and public gatherings. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5% in March 2020 due to the shutdown of major industries and businesses. However, with the accessibility to online channels, purchasing across industries began to rebound. This January, consumer spending increased by 1.8%, which was its biggest gain since March 2021, as reported by Reuters. In addition to this, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 5.4% in the 12 months through January 2023, after soaring 5.3% in December. The recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) sent a chill through the stock market while impacting a wide range of industries. Though the retail industry had less exposure to SVB in comparison with other sectors, the past few years saw growing public offerings of tech-focused retailers. It’s about time that this fallout would hamper investments in these new digital ventures. Forbes reported that following the collapse, Shopify temporarily stopped payments to online sellers with SVB accounts. Similarly, Stitch Fix lost a $40 million line of credit it had at the bank. To know more about the impact of the bank collapse on the retail industry, readers can have a look at our previous article titled 15 Best Cyclical Stocks to Buy Now.

While a near-term headwind to sales, management plans to offset the lost business by expanding distribution to other leading brands, rolling out larger neighborhood free-standing stores, and expanding two new growth banners (WSS & Atmos). WSS stores will provide an off-mall presence and focus on the rapidly growing and underserved Hispanic market. Atmos will provide Foot Locker with the ability to expand into Japan and Asia sneaker market with their digitally led business model. These new growth concepts have a combined potential to add more than $1B in sales by 2024.
