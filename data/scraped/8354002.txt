Here’s a high-level overview of the professionally-installed systems: ADT Packages ADT offers four equipment packages for customers to choose from. While all of them technically allow you to customize with add-ons, the build-your-own package is best for those searching for a low price and minimal products. However, if you plan on adding on more cameras and safety devices than what the build-your-own bundle offers, consider going with one of the other three options.

– Farnam Alyasof, Brinks Home user Browsing Brinks Home’s website offered a streamlined experience, devoid of clutter, which facilitated easy navigation through its offerings.

Everybody’s home is different, and everyone has a unique sense of what makes them feel secure. Fortunately, home security systems are available to cover both of those variables. Here’s how to know which security system is right for you. In the information age, online review platforms hold a host of information about home security products that you can use. Go beyond relying on simple star ratings and read some of the reviews, good and bad, to learn about the system you’re considering from real-world stories. While testing home security systems firsthand isn’t always possible without purchasing a system, many home security companies offer trial periods or multiple free weeks of use before committing to one. Home security systems are available in a wide price range. You may not need the most extravagant and expensive system to protect your home, or you may want the best that money can buy. Balance your security needs, including your peace of mind, with the overall cost of the system purchase and monitoring fees, if applicable. For example, our top-pick security system comes with a start-up equipment cost of $599 and a minimum installation cost of $99. While that may be appropriate in some situations for some budgets, many homes may only require a basic system from eufy or Wyze that can start below $100 and is expandable later if necessary or when the budget allows. Each home security provider offers its equipment and components in various ways—most offer equipment packages that include the most common items that customers normally choose. These packages often start as starter packages that include a few window and door sensors and perhaps a control module or a single camera or doorbell cam. Other options may consist of comprehensive whole-house packages that have everything you need to fully protect a home. Most often, the packages are customizable by adding components at purchase or as you develop your system over time. Choose your home security provider partially based on whether or not a particular company offers all of the products you need to secure your home now and in the future. There are three installation options. The first is DIY installation, in which the customer installs their own system or hires an outside party to perform the work. Professionally installed systems, the second option, often come with an additional price tag. The installation is performed by the company or an installer it hires. Finally, some companies offer packages that include professional installation in the cost of the package that you choose. Depending on the type of home security system chosen and monitoring specifics, you may have several options for various features like smart home compatibility and monitoring. If you equip your home with smart home automation devices and a voice assistant, ensure the security system you choose is compatible with the product in your home for seamless integration. Your monitoring options will include choices between self-monitoring or off-site professional monitoring. Your options will depend on both the company you choose and the system you install. Alerts, real-time or in notification form, are part of most home security systems. However, the specifics of what triggers the alerts and notifications will vary by equipment, company and monitoring plan. You’re not likely to purchase a driveway alarm system if you live in an apartment building. In the same vein, avoid buying a security system for your home that includes elements and components that you won’t ever need. Purchase a system with the right items to keep your home safe without paying for things you won’t use. In some cases, you may find it’s worth it to sign up for a bundle, which could include a security system and other systems together. Depending on how much and what type of home security you’re looking for, you may want to consider each company’s offering. Buying a home security system rewards you with more benefits than simply providing peace of mind. Installing a home security system protects your home and possessions, but many also watch for non-human intruders, such as fire, water and poisonous gases. Convenience is another plus of owning a home security system. You can operate most systems remotely, and if your home is equipped with smart home products, you can even control functions like HVAC, door locks and window blinds throughout the day without being home. However, some minor downsides tend more toward being inconveniences rather than overtly bad issues. The following are some pros and cons to consider before investing in your security system.  Many homeowners aren’t aware of some of the surprising stats regarding home invasions and burglaries. Perhaps the most unexpected fact is that a quarter of burglaries happen in broad daylight rather than in the middle of the night. Other statistics are eye-opening as well: Honing in on the cost of a home security system can be tricky since the costs can fluctuate dramatically based on various security needs. Whether you need a simple doorbell camera or a plethora of security cameras and monitoring devices, you could see your costs span from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. In the table below, you’ll find some industry averages from hardware costs to activation fees. From a functionality standpoint, there is little difference between a professionally installed system and a DIY kit. The main differences come down to support for your system and peace of mind. These are typically wireless security systems by design, meaning the cameras, sensors, control hub and other pieces operate over your home’s Wi-Fi connections and are, therefore, easier to install than wired systems. Although you can have a DIY system monitored professionally, many of them work well as self-monitored products. Pros Cons Professionally installed security systems are often, but not always, more robust than DIY systems and come with some extra perks. They can be either wired or wireless home security cameras or systems. It’s possible to hire a professional to install a self-monitored, DIY system, but generally, pro systems are installed for you and are monitored by a remote entity.

Compare Quotes From Top-rated Home Security Installers Free, No-commitment Estimates Considering more than just protecting your valuables from would-be intruders, home security systems can pay for themselves and prove their worth through lower homeowner’s insurance premiums, peace of mind and the convenience of performing home functions in your absence. Overall, for most homeowners, security systems are at least worth their cost. To determine the best home security systems ranking, the Forbes Home editorial team analyzed 22 companies and 133 systems. Each company’s star rating was determined by evaluating a variety of metrics represented in the below pie chart: App reviews, similar to overall customer ratings, can indicate the health of a home security company’s user experience for customers. Ratings from the App Store and Play Store were evaluated, and the higher the rating for a company, the more points that company received. Customer ratings are a strong indicator of a company’s performance, making it 25% of the total ranking. The team evaluated customer ratings from platforms like the BBB, Trustpilot and Consumer Affairs. Customer support options accounted for 6% of the total ranking, and include each company’s offering (or lack thereof) of live chat, phone service, community forum, knowledge base and a blog. Pricing is an important factor when choosing among the best home security companies, which is why it accounts for 14% of the total ranking. The editorial team evaluated monthly self-monitoring and pro-monitoring fees at both the lowest and highest price points. A home security company’s ease of setup and installation policies could be a major factor for homeowners. The editorial team evaluated the setup for each company as well as contract lengths, policies and limitations to account for 16% of the total ranking. A home security company’s offering of equipment and package options is paramount when deciding how to approach your home’s security needs, which is why it makes up 18% of the total ranking. The team analyzed each company’s offerings of equipment including full professionally installed systems, wireless security options, cellular network cameras, night vision cameras, Wi-Fi security cameras, plug-in wired cameras, outdoor cameras, fire detection and smoke alarms, panic buttons, water leak detection, sirens and more. Extra smart home features are a commodity in a time of homes adapting to smart home integration, which is why this category received 14% of the total ranking’s weight. The editorial team evaluated each home security company’s list of smart home integrations with platforms including Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Samsung, Apple Homekit and more. Additional points were awarded based on the judgment of our review team. Points were awarded for inclusions such as additional service availability and outstanding achievements or awards.  You can find out more about how Forbes Home rates home security systems in our detailed methodology page. As the name implies, wired alarm systems are hard-wired into the home’s electrical system, and each system component is connected to the next by a physical wire. Wired security systems can be trickier to install and so you should expect to spend upwards of three to four hours installing a wired system. With a professional, this time could decrease. Wireless systems offer similar functionality, but the components communicate using your home’s Wi-Fi system instead of wires. You can generally expect to spend approximately two hours installing a wireless home security system. Many home security and alarm companies require you to sign a contract for professional monitoring services. Contract lengths vary from one month to five years. DIY home security systems that connect to a security company may involve a contract but often don’t. The companies on our list that require contracts are Vivint, which requires a minimum commitment of 60 months; ADT, with a 36-month minimum and Brinks Home, also with a 36-month minimum. SimpliSafe, Ring, Cove, Abode, Frontpoint, eufy and Wyze all have no contract requirements for both self and professional monitoring services. Home security cameras come in a wide range of styles and types. Types include doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, solar-operated cameras, floodlight cameras, indoor cameras, outdoor cameras and more. They also have a wide range of abilities, including infrared, zoom, remote control and motion detection. Also, they may be wireless or wired. The best security camera for your home may not necessarily be which brand name, but instead, which one provides the functions you need for your home at a price that fits your budget and is reliable. You can install a home security system in a rental property. Wireless home security systems are the best choice for this purpose. They’re generally easy to install, won’t damage the property and you can take them with you when you move out.
