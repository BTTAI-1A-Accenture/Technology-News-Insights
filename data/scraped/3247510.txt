Another offensive lineman has set his visit date for this weekend’s spring game. Douglas Utu is a 4-star offensive tackle who is a member of the class of 2025. Utu currently plays for Bishop Gorman High out of Las Vegas, Nevada. He is currently the No. 1 ranked player in the state of Nevada for the class of 2025 and the No. 2 offensive tackle nationwide. The tackle has already received an offer to play in the 2025 Polynesian Bowl in Honolulu at Kamehameha High School. Utu holds 12 scholarship offers from schools such as Georgia, Miami, Michigan, and Oklahoma. Nebraska’s annual spring game will take place this Saturday at 1:00 PM on the Big Ten Network.
