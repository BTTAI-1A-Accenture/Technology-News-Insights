Dibb also notes that it was expected that Binance would encounter challenges due to the ongoing comments and issues raised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies. Surprisingly, Binance‚Äôs BNB token showed little reaction to the news, seeing a minor decline of 0.46% to USD 261.46. Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at I.G. Markets, observed that the market‚Äôs response has been relatively mute. This suggests that it either ignored the news or fully understood its essence. In a tweet on Thursday, Binance.US expressed its view that the SEC‚Äôs perspective on cryptocurrency is ‚Äúextremely forceful and harsh.‚Äù The exchange pledges its commitment to actively defend itself, its customers, and the industry against what it considers to be meritless attacks from the SEC. Following the lawsuits, the crypto industry has criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler, although he has denied allegations that the agency is attempting to suppress the crypto industry.¬† The SEC has taken immediate action, wanting to freeze the assets of Binance‚Äôs U.S. subsidiary and bring back the customers‚Äô assets. They also pursued emergency relief actions against other entities connected to Binance. The commission filed an emergency order with the federal judge in Washington, D.C., to freeze the assets of Binance‚Äôs US subsidiary, Binance.US. The SEC alleges that Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, have demonstrated ‚Äúdisregard‚Äù for U.S. law.  BREAKING: The SEC just asked the court to freeze all assets in Binance US Assets are about to flow out of Binance US quickly! pic.twitter.com/Fqg8b4MSsG ‚Äî Genevieve Roch-Decter, CFA (@GRDecter) June 6, 2023 If the courts grant the order, Binance must repatriate any money held outside the US for US customers. The freeze would apply to Binance‚Äôs two US holding companies and accounts held at various financial institutions. However, the non-US-regulated international exchange would remain unaffected. The SEC‚Äôs move comes after it filed a lawsuit against Binance and Zhao, accusing them of fraudulent activities, improper commingling of funds, and operating as an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC argued for the emergency restraining order to stop asset excess due to Zhao and the company‚Äôs alleged history of breaking US laws. In addition, the order mandates that Zhao and his two holding companies must provide a justification for not complying with the preliminary injunction, while also prohibiting all three entities from destroying any potential evidence The SEC‚Äôs filing includes an exception for BAM Trading Services Inc., permitting them to continue transferring customer assets for withdrawal processing as long as they do not belong to any Binance-related entity. This year has witnessed significant regulatory efforts and enforcement actions in the US regarding cryptocurrencies. The SEC also filed a lawsuit against U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase. Similar actions were taken against the crypto exchange Bittrex earlier in the year.
