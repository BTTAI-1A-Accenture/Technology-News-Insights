Mullanpur police have failed to arrest the culprits involved in the murder of Dharampal, more than 48 hours after the cab driver was found dead inside his vehicle on Monday night. Officers investigating the case, however, on Wednesday said that they were very close to making a breakthrough, and at the moment suspect that the cab driver was murdered owing to a professional rivalry he had with someone. “There are leads that indicate that Dharampal was working with a ride hailing service, InDrive. His rivals didn’t like that and may have probably killed him in cold blood for the same,” the officer told The Indian Express. He added that Dharampal was called by the assailants for a meeting, during which an altercation might have taken place and the cab driver murdered. Kharar (II) DySP Dharamvir Singh was not available for a comment on the issue. Dharampal was found murdered late on Monday night with his throat slit. A group of cab drivers subsequently on Tuesday had held a protest to demand the immediate arrest of all the culprits. The officer added that the suspects possibly involved in the murder had been traced to Haryana and would be arrested soon.
