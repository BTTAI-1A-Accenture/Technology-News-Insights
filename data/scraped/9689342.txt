TikTok is currently experimenting with a new shopping feature called "Trendy Beat" within its app, reported TechCrunch. This feature, being tested in the U.K., allows users to purchase products that have gained popularity in trending videos. The items available for sale are shipped and sold by a subsidiary of ByteDance, TikTok's parent company. Among the products featured in the shopping section are items like ear wax extraction tools. This information was originally reported by the Financial Times. According to TechCrunch, TikTok clarified on Thursday that its new e-commerce initiative is not undergoing testing in the United States. Instead, the company is currently prioritizing the expansion of its TikTok Shop, which allows brands to sell their products directly on the platform. The focus in the U.S. is on bringing in new merchants to enhance the offerings available on TikTok Shop. While the current testing of the Trendy Beat feature is not taking place in the U.S., there is potential for its future expansion, the report further added. TikTok recently filed a trademark application for Trendy Beat in the United States, suggesting that the test feature could eventually be introduced there as well. Reportedly, the trademark application specifically mentions a range of apparel items, including dresses, scarves, hats, footwear, bathing suits, sleep masks, sweaters, skirts, shirts, suits, and other similar products. According to the Financial Times, ByteDance's strategy to sell its own products within the TikTok app is known internally as "Project S." This initiative capitalizes on TikTok's insights into the trending products on its platform, enabling ByteDance to either acquire or produce those items. To manufacture these products, ByteDance utilizes a network of suppliers. As per the report, TikTok's latest feature aims to compete with retail giants like Amazon and Shein, signifying a departure from its current e-commerce approach primarily centered around the TikTok Shop marketplace. While TikTok Shop enables brands to sell their products directly on the app, the introduction of this new feature involves TikTok selling its own products. This new model resembles the e-commerce strategy employed by Amazon Basics and Shein, where these companies promote and sell their own popular products. ¬† ¬† Milestone Alert!
