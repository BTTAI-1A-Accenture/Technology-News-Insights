Reno County commissioners voted unanimously to renew insurance and cybersecurity coverage with Travelers Insurance. Reno County uses Fee Insurance Group and Travelers for its insurance coverages. Travelers does not provide coverage for earthquakes and floods. “They (Travelers) wanted to be a competitive as possible,” said Bob Fee, insurance broker for Travelers, which handles property and casualty insurance for Reno County. “I think this is a nice renewal with the insurance coverage,” said Reno County commissioner Ron Sellers. Also topping the agenda was a resolution that would raise the expense and stipend for volunteer firefighters in rural fire districts. The raise would be from $10 to $12.50 for expenses and $10 to $12.50 for stipends, not to exceed $100 per day. County commissioners Sellers, Ron Hirst and Daniel P. Friesen approved the measure unanimously. The amounts would be paid to each responding volunteer firefighter for emergencies such as fires, motor vehicle accidents, emergency medical calls, train derailments, storm watches and other public safety responses requested by Hutchinson/Reno County Emergency Communications.
