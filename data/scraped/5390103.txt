First Team Club Tickets & Museum Download the official FC Barcelona App Barça continued their winning habit in the Liga Asobal, more than doubling Guadalajara to win 23-50, showing that despite already being confirmed champions, they have no intention of letting off. A perfect record beckons, and it was never in question that was not going to happen against a vastly overpowered Guadalajara side, with Gonzalo Pérez de Vargas as impeccable as ever and the goals flowing thick and fast from Fàbregas, Ian Barrufet, Ricahrdson, Janc and Dika Mem. Towards the end of the game, coach Ortega gave some of the less regular players a chance and they certainly didn't waste it, with some fabulous handball played by the youngsters Already 12-21 up at the break, he could clearly afford to make that decision, and in fact, Bar#a scored at an even faster rate with some of the less experienced players on the court. 23-50 was Bar#a-s biggest win of the season, and was just one short of their highest ever league score of 51 against Sagunto in 2014/15.
