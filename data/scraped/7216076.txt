One of the most common themes in anime is fantastical settings where the adventures never end. Add in the elements of a school setting, and you have the makings of an anime about a magical academy. Anime series set at magic academies have skyrocketed in popularity over the past decade. These shows depict epic tales of heroism, drama, and interpersonal relationships.
     Fans who enjoy jungle settings should take a look at the following anime.                     Fan imaginations can run wild thanks to the many anime shows depicting magic academies, such as The Misfit of Demon King Academy and The Irregular of Magic High School. However, not every anime series depicting a magical academy is created equally, and there are a few that truly shine.
      Updated March 11, 2024 by Oluwatokiloba Folami: One thing anime often does is blend the ordinary with the extraordinary, supernatural, or magical. In this case, these anime blend ordinary school life with magical activities.
                         Set in magical academies, fans are pulled into a fun and adventurous world where the main character interacts with magical creatures like mages, witches, and wizards as they try to hone and sharpen their magical skills.

                         Failing or repeating a class is most likely every student’s nightmare, especially Alto Goldfilled.

                         Alto is very dedicated to his studies and cannot stand failing, so he does all he can to make sure he passes the class. Eventually, he is able to pass after he successfully summons Vermeil, a mysterious and powerful demon who decides to become Alto’s inferior. The fun thing about anime is mixing the ordinary and extraordinary, and it is quite notable in this anime as fans see Alto trying to stay at the top of his class while being a master to a demon and completely oblivious to the fact that his childhood friend, Lila, is in love with him.

Unfortunately for Akuto, he receives a prophecy from the school’s spirit that he has been destined to be a demon king.
                         This prophecy goes against what Akuto wants for himself, and although he tries to go against it, he fails woefully.

                         Onmyodu is a form of magic technique that is dominant in the world of Tokyo Ravens. These magical powers are seen in the Tsuchimikado family, and everyone born into this family is destined to have magical powers except the protagonist of this anime, Harutora Tsuchimikado. Harutora has no problems with not having magical powers and is satisfied with his ordinary life until he finds himself at Onmyou Academy with his best friend, Touji.
     The 2010s are a golden age of anime series, especially when it comes to great supernatural animes. These series, however, are grossly underrated.                     The Onmyou Academy was put in place to preserve the Onmyoudou magical technique. On entering the school, Harutora has no knowledge about magic, but as the anime progresses, he realizes that he has magic in him, but it was sealed, and soon enough, he is able to break the seal and become very knowledgeable and proficient in the use of onmyodou.
                          Ever since Atsuko "Akko" Kagari’s idol, Shiny Chariot, performed, Atsuko fell in love with witches and magic. Akko cherished Shiny Chariot’s words and swore to become just like her someday. Now a teenager, Akko joins the prestigious Luna Nova Magical Academy. However, her non-magical background and magical ineptitude put her a foot behind her classmates when it comes to utilizing magic.
                         Despite various challenges, Akko strives to prove to everyone that she can and will become a renowned witch despite the odds. Taking on the beautiful and powerful Diana Cavendish as her rival, Akko is determined and trains like never before.
                          Taking place in the renowned Tristain Academy, this anime has a magic academy at the center of its plot. The series portrays the life of Louise Françoise, a young mage who, despite having lots of magic, is unable to properly cast spells, much like the early days of Noelle Silver in the Black Clover anime series. Because of her inability to cast spells, Louise is nicknamed “Louise the Zero” by her classmates.
                         Despite her lack of expertise, Louise’s first summoning ritual summons a boy named Saito Hiraga. Saito seems to have uncanny relations to Gandalfr, a powerful familiar. This suggests that there may be more to Louise and her familiar than meets the eye.
                          Despite it still airing in fall 2023, this anime series has managed to portray its setting, Hebrion Academy, in a way that merges well with the story.
                         The series follows the life of one of the last-standing magicians, Desir Arman. Luckily for Desir, he is sent back in time right before he meets his end. Now a youth once more, Desir plans to achieve power as quickly as possible, while also building up magicians and warriors as he realizes he cannot face the existence that threatens humanity's continuity alone. With power and knowledge about future events, Desir seeks to carve out a new future for himself and the world.

                         The son of the legendary Two Blade Chloe Halford, Oliver Horn, enrolls at Kimberly Magic School. While attending, Oliver comes across Nanao Hibiya, a samurai with whom he finds joy in clashing swords. While Oliver seems to be attending like every other student, the young man plans to murder various members of Kimberly’s faculty, who contributed to his murder.
                         The Reign of the Seven Spell Blades is an exciting new magic school anime. While most protagonists are out to become legendary heroes, Oliver’s drive is one of revenge. As Oliver and Nanao realize that dark secrets lie behind the scenes, the duo must form bonds with each other rather than foster their rivalry.
                          Driven by neither riches nor glory, young Mash Burnedead has no magic in a magic world where those without are persecuted to ensure the purity of bloodlines. Despite this, Mash is forced to enroll in Easton Magic Academy to become a Divine Visionary to save his father, who is on probation for shielding a non-magic user like him. With no magic and only physical strength to rely on at a magic academy, Mash must rely on his muscles and go above and beyond.
     Despite living an isolated life, Mash eventually makes some trustworthy friends as he enrolls in Easton Magic Academy.
                     After enrolling at the prestigious Easton Academy, Mash realizes that there is more than meets the eye as a dark and mysterious organization lurks in the background. Moreover, they seem to be after him.
                          When it comes to anime about a magical school, The Misfit of Demon King Academy is up there with the greatest of them. The anime series depicts the standard trope of a group of heroes with superpowers, but it does so in a way that puts the spotlight on more than just the main character.
                         The series is based on the life of Anos Voldigoad, the most powerful demon lord in history, who was reincarnated 2000 years after his death. After being resurrected into a world where its inhabitants' magical prowess has diminished, Anos works to regain his position as the most powerful demon lord at Demon King Academy.
                          The Irregular at Magic High School anime series is one of the few to combine magic and technology to such a high standard. At First High School, where students are ranked according to their magical powers, the anime follows Tatsuya Shiba and his sister Miyuki as they navigate their high school years.
     Anyone who enjoyed watching The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic will probably also love these similar isekai anime series as well. 
                     Tatsuya, the show's protagonist, has a low status because of his limited magical abilities. His technical wizardry in employing the magic he does have does distinguish him, however. His engineering prowess is unparalleled, and he is known the world over as a "magic engineer" behind an assumed name. Tatsuya's low level of magical ability makes him a misfit in the rankings because it understates his genuine strength.
                          A common setting for magical academy anime is the institution itself. A Certain Magical Index, an anime series, goes even further by depicting its academy on a citywide scale. Academy City is depicted prominently throughout the anime series and features a wide variety of educational facilities, from pre-schools to higher institutions.
                         Experts in the fields of magic, esper powers, and advanced technology work hand in hand with various organizations. The so-called sorcerers of the magic faction face off against the espers of the single-talent faction in the anime series. Both sides are vying for Index, an entity that contains the secrets of more than 103,000 magical grimoires.

To this extent, Arata joins the Royal Biblia Academy, where he meets the Trinity Seven, a renowned group of seven mages.

                          Few heroes go to a fantasy world and come back to earth with a demon lord's daughter. Akatsuki Ousawa from the anime series Aesthetica of a Rogue Hero is one such person. Thirty years ago in the anime world, the Samon Syndrome—a disease that allows characters of the series to travel to fantasy worlds and back was discovered.
                         If said characters travel and obtain magical abilities, they keep their abilities after returning to Earth. Akatsuki, one of the few heroes to return, came back with the daughter of the demon lord whom he defeated. On returning, he was forced to join Babel, a special magic school for individuals who gained powers in a fantasy world.

                         Sixteen years before the start of the storyline portrayed in the Magical Warfare anime series, the world was divided in two by the epic First Great Magic War. The war tore the earth asunder, dividing it into the Ruined World, the remnant of the old world, and the Living World, a world created after the battle.
                         After the battle, a spell was cast to prevent magicians from battling in the Living World. However, both worlds started interacting more when the protagonist of the series, Takeshi Nanase from the Living World enrolled in the Subaru Magic Academy in the Ruined World.
