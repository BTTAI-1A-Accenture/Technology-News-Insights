 We’re excited to continue our series on how POCUS can transform the bedside clinical exam. In this month’s newsletter, we examine the traditional physical exam performed in basic prenatal obstetric care and explore how POCUS coupled with the physical exam leads to more accurate and timely diagnosis of potentially life-threatening conditions.   Nurse midwives, family physicians, obstetricians in labor and delivery wards and prenatal clinics around the world routinely use the physical examination to answer important clinical questions such as whether a patient is breech.   In 1846, Christian Gerhard Leopold was born in Meeran, Saxony and would devote his life to advancing the knowledge and practice of obstetrics including shaping aspects of the modern obstetric exam.    One of Leopold’s most enduring contributions is his description and classification of the four “Leopold-Handgriffe,” or Leopold Handgrips published in the journal “Archiv für Gynäkologie,” better known today as the Leopold’s Maneuvers. These maneuvers are a series of systematic abdominal palpations performed by a healthcare provider to assess the position, presentation, and engagement of the fetus in the pregnant pelvis.  Today, Leopold’s maneuvers are an integral part of obstetric examination, enabling healthcare professionals to gather crucial information about the fetus’s position, presentation, engagement, and descent. These techniques are invaluable in facilitating safe and successful deliveries while reducing potential risks to both the mother and the baby. It is important to note that while Leopold’s maneuvers have long been relied upon for assessing fetal presentation, advancements in technology have introduced alternative methods, such as ultrasound, for this purpose. Ultrasound utilizes sound waves to create images of the fetus in the mother’s womb, providing detailed information about its position and presentation and has significantly improved our ability to accurately determine fetal presentation. Read more. ﻿
