LIHEAP helps low-income households with energy bills.  Customers can now apply for "up to $450," according to LIHEAP.  The program's application deadline is Sept. 30 or until funds are no longer available. LIHEAP says assistance for all utilities is available online "for most Entergy Arkansas customers,  based on which community action agency serves them." Applications are also available to fill out in person at local community organizations.  The eligibility depends on the size of the household and income, according to LIHEAP. The 2023 Arkansas Eligibility Chart, along with more information about scheduling an appointment and required documentation, is available on EOA's website.
