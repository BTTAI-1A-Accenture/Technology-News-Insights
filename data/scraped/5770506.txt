                13th March 2023               In a notable development, credit reference agency Experian’s appeal against an ICO enforcement notice which ordered changes to how it processes personal data for direct marketing purposes was largely successful. While the First-Tier Tribunal (Information Rights) supported some aspects of the ICO’s original decision, it mostly found in favour of Experian. The enforcement notice substituted by the Tribunal is much narrower in scope than the original. Walker Morris data protection expert Jeanette Burgess considers Experian’s appeal and the Tribunal’s key findings. What’s striking about the Tribunal’s decision is that the evidence given by one of the ICO’s key witnesses was found to be significantly flawed. The effect was that there was little or no evidence to support some of the positions taken in the enforcement notice, which contained various factual errors. In exercising her discretion, the Information Commissioner got the balance wrong in terms of proportionality because she fundamentally misunderstood the actual outcomes of Experian’s processing. The decision confirms that the legitimate interests basis can be used for processing personal data for direct marketing purposes; and that notification to data subjects through third parties can be sufficient to meet the GDPR’s transparency requirements. While the decision will be welcomed, the ICO is applying for permission to appeal and so this may not be the end of the story. In July 2018 the ICO launched an investigation into data protection compliance in the data broking sector, where companies collect personal data from various sources, then combine it and sell/license it to others. The investigation focused on the provision of offline direct marketing services; by companies including the major credit reference agencies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. A business unit within Experian processes the data of around 51 million UK residents using data analytics to provide marketing services which it sells to third-party clients. Experian is a data controller for these purposes. According to the ICO’s October 2020 report, significant data protection failures were found at each company. The key concerns centred on: the transparency of the processing; Article 14 of the GDPR and invisible processing; using credit reference data for limited direct marketing purposes and appropriate lawful bases for processing. Article 14 of the GDPR is a key transparency requirement. It outlines the privacy notice information that the data controller must provide to the data subject where their personal data has been acquired from another source. The ICO issued Experian with an enforcement notice which required it, among other things, to make changes to how its privacy information was worded, presented and communicated. That included providing all data subjects with an Article 14 compliant privacy notice and to stop processing the personal data of any data subject who hadn’t been sent one. The company was also required to stop using CRA-derived data for any direct marketing purposes except as requested by data subjects and to stop processing any personal data where the objective legitimate interest assessment could not be said to favour the interests of Experian, having particular regard to the transparency of the processing and the intrusive nature of profiling. Experian’s appeal argued that the law had been applied incorrectly and/or that flawed conclusions had been reached on the facts and that the notice’s requirements were disproportionate and unfair and it should be set aside. Experian said it would be compelled as a result to adopt an unworkable, purely consent based, model for offline direct marketing services. If complied with, it would force the company to shut down that part of its business. The ICO’s case was that Experian’s processing will be surprising to the individuals whose personal data is processed; the processing is intrusive; and the assessments undertaken in balancing Experian’s legitimate interests are flawed. The Tribunal’s substituted notice is much narrower in scope than the ICO’s. It focuses on the requirement for Experian to implement a system so that it can provide all data subjects whose personal data is obtained from one of three named open sources with a privacy notice; whether that’s directly or through the notifications given by those open sources. There are some exceptions to this, for example where Experian obtains the data from its CRA business, consumer services business or third-party commercial suppliers.
