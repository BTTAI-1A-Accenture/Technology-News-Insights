The company said it was on track to cut $500 million in costs in its third-quarter fiscal report, which revealed a net sales decline of 33% to $1.26 billion over the prior year on $393 million in losses. The decline in net sales versus last year was driven by "lower customer traffic and reduced levels of inventory availability, among other factors," the company said in a public notice of late filing last week to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The retailer expressed uncertainty about its fate, adding that the company faces "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue operating on its own.
