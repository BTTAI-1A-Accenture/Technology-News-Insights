Many Michiganders have heard of it, but few have seen it and even fewer ever will. I'm talking about General Motors Milford Proving Ground. The site straddles Oakland and Livingston counties and sits tucked away about 4 miles from the tiny village of Milford and a good 45-minute drive west from the big city of Detroit. The proving ground is a historic place, about to turn 100 years old next year. It is home to deer, foxes, eagles and pretty much all of GM’s top-secret future products. The vehicles GM sells throughout the world are partly developed and thoroughly tested at the proving ground by some of the best drivers and engineers in the world. These folks are the Top Guns of driving, capable of evaluating every performance aspect of the car while taking laps around a racetrack at speeds that can top 150 mph. The site is also a staple of economic stability for the surrounding communities that rely on the 4,900 workers there for revenue.
