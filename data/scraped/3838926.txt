The new Marantz CD 50n is both a compact disc player and a networked audio playback source, offering support for a range of digital music sources. It features an ESS Sabre DAC plus Marantz musical digital filters. Due to the provision of multiple digital inputs plus network access via Ethernet or Wi-Fi, the CD 50n can also support music files sent either directly via digital audio connections or streamed over a home network using its built-in HEOS music streaming platform. Music streaming from mobile devices is also available via Bluetooth, Spotify Connect and AirPlay2, while homeowners can connect their TV audio into the CD 50n via HDMI ARC. The Marantz model 50 integrated has a 70w per channel of high-current Class A/B power. The high current output architecture is based on parallel push/pull pairs of output devices, coupled with a substantial toroidal power supply and internal signal path topography designed to minimise internal impedance losses. The pure analogue configuration, including a MM Phono stage, is suited to be partnered with vinyl sources.
