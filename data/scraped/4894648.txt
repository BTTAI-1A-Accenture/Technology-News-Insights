It was issued 296 patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office within the state, comprising 22.2% of all patents considered for a statewide analysis by ClickUp. ClickUp used data from the USPTO to analyze the top patent earner in every state. The data looked at the assignees for both regular utility and design patents and was limited to assignees that received at least ten patents within the year.

Nearly 160,000 patents were assigned across the U.S. in 2022, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. When a patent is awarded through the USPTO, the individual or company it’s given to has the license to a temporary monopoly on business for that specific product or service. Companies have used patent law for decades to defend their intellectual property—including designs and devices against competitors that might attempt to profit off of stolen ideas. Tech and engineering firms were the most inventive patent winners across the U.S. last year. Nationally, most top patent earners last year were private organizations.
