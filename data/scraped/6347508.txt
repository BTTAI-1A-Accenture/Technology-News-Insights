   MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Henry Schein, Inc. (Nasdaq: HSIC), the world’s largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental and medical practitioners, announced today the acquisition of Regional Health Care Group Pty Ltd (RHCG), a medical products distribution company serving public- and private-sector customers in Australia and New Zealand.

Headquartered in Sydney, Australia, with an office in Auckland, New Zealand, RHCG offers a wide range of consumables, equipment, and pharmaceuticals – including many on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis – primarily to public- and private-sector customers. The day-to-day operations of RHCG are led by General Manager Stephen Doorey, who will continue to manage the business under the highly regarded Regional Health Care Group brand. Mr. Doorey will report to Mike Covey, Vice President and Managing Director of Henry Schein’s business in Australia and New Zealand.
