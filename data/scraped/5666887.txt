   on July 26, 2023 at 3:05AM PDT Fortnite's island is about to get a delivery from Planet Express. After teasing the collaboration yesterday, Epic Games has confirmed Futurama will be joining Fortnite's ever-growing list of partners, with multiple skins and other cosmetics included in the event. Three of Futurama's most recognizable characters--Philip J. Fry, Leela, and the robotic Bender--will see cosmetic bundles added to the in-game item shop today. Each skin will be bundled with an alternate style and a back bling, with multiple pickaxes, a glider, and an emote also available for purchase. The cosmetic bundles coming to the item shop as part of the Futurama Fortnite event are as follows: A new weapon, Bender's Shiny Metal Raygun, will also now appear on the island during battle royale matches, both among loot found on the ground and/or in chests as well as via Bender himself (for a fee). The Shiny Metal Raygun has infinite plasma ammo, but it will overheat and need to cool down if fired too often. Fortnite is available to download now for free on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile devices. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?
