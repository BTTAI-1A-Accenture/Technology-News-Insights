            Having played rugby most of my life and thriving on the camaraderie in that environment it's taken me a surprisingly long time to recognise the camaraderie you can have in your professional life. Especially as a creative.

That extends beyond the people "in the trenches" with you day to day, on projects or on set and into your wider network. The shared frustrations and in jokes. The mutual understandings and experiences. 

They can provide a surprisingly strong support network when things aren't going great. Whether that's by letting you blow off steam, sharing a relevant meme or providing valuable advice. 

And when you're winning they're usually the first to cheer for you. Because they know how valuable the win is. 
Are you looking to join a professional network for creative strategists? There are many options available, depending on your preferences, needs, and goals. To help you find the right network, here are some tips: Start by searching online for existing networks, groups, platforms, or associations that focus on creative strategy or related topics. You can also ask for recommendations from your contacts or post a request on social media or forums. If you can't find a network that meets your expectations, consider creating your own. Use online tools such as websites, apps, or social media to create and manage your own network and invite other creative strategists who share your vision, mission, or values to join.
