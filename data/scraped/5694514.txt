The OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) has built a programme of work based on decades of experience, and now plays a leading and central role in global policy development. We do this by: Jerry Sheehan Director
Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation Jens Lundsgaard Deputy Director
Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation Audrey Plonk Deputy Director
Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation The Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation coordinates the work of six OECD committees. The Committee on Consumer Policy (CCP) and its working party promote consumer trust by developing cross-border policies and mechanisms for a more efficient, transparent and fair global marketplace.  Key areas of work include the OECD global product recalls portal, and analysis on protecting online consumers and online advertising. The CCP will hold the first ever OECD Consumer Ministerial on 8-9 October 2024 on the theme of consumers at the centre of the digital and green transitions. The Committee on Industry, Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIIE) is rooted in empirical analysis and a “bottom-up” approach that looks below aggregates to examine how specific firm and sector characteristics affect economic outcomes.  Key areas of CIIE work include productivity growth and business dynamics; micro-data analysis; industrial policy and green innovation; human capital and skills; intellectual property rights; global value chains and the measurement of trade in value added; structural change; and innovative start-ups and small and medium sized firms (SMEs). The CIIE provides joint support (with the OECD Economics Department) for the Global Forum on Productivity. The Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy (CSTP) and its working parties encourage co-operation among OECD members and partner economies in the field of science, technology and innovation policy, working to support economic, social, and scientific aims, and improving sustainable development and well-being. Key areas of recent work include: science-industry co-creation; global science policies; support for business R&D, including tax incentives; mission-oriented innovation policies; technology governance; biotechnology, nanotechnology and emerging technologies. The CSTP performs national innovation reviews, and supports the OECD Space Forum as well as work on the ocean economy. CSTP held a Ministerial meeting in April 2024 under the broad theme of “S&T Policy 2025: Enabling sustainability transitions through science, technology and innovation”. The Digital Policy Committee (DPC, formerly CDEP) is responsible for developing evidence-based policies that create the policy and regulatory environments needed to expand the Internet and information and communications technologies as drivers of innovation, productivity, growth, sustainable development and social well-being. Some key areas of recent work in the committee and its working parties include AI; terrorist and violent extremist content online; Internet access and connectivity; digital security, privacy and data governance; and measurement of the digital economy. In December 2022 the committee held a Ministerial meeting in Spain, where Ministers agreed to a Declaration on a Trusted, Sustainable and Inclusive Digital Future, a Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data held by Private Sector Entities, and new OECD legal instruments on digital security. Ministers also announced the launch of a new OECD Global Forum on Technology as a venue for regular in-depth dialogue to get ahead of long-term opportunities and risks presented by technology. These committees bring together government, industry, and trade union interests from OECD and partner economies to exchange views and conduct economic and policy analysis on all aspects of the steel and shipbuilding sectors, aiming for competitive markets that are free of distortions.  The OECD also facilitates a G20-mandated Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity (GFSEC) that aims to enhance information sharing and co-operation and take effective steps to address the challenge of excess capacity.    Never miss our latest reports, statistics and policy recommendations on innovation, science, technology and industry.
