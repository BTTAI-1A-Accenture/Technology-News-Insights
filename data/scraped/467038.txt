A new bed frame can dramatically improve the look and feel of a bedroom. It's the centerpiece of our sleeping quarters, after all, which is why it's important to choose a frame that evokes a cozy and inviting atmosphere to relax and unwind. If you're in the market for a fresh bed frame, upholstered bed frames are always a great choice; they can provide a modern yet comfortable look to your space. Plus, there are plenty of options to choose from that will be the perfect fit for your bedroom.  To help you find the perfect upholstered bed frame for your bedroom, we consulted Devin Shaffer for his expertise on why an upholstered bed frame or headboard is worth it and what to look for when shopping for one.  "When shopping for components of upholstered beds (headboard, footboards, etc.), always make sure that they're compatible with your bed frame. Most frames are universal, so it's an uncommon problem, but we do see it happen from time to time," Shaffer says. Another thing to note is that some headboards are offered at different heights. If you're tall, have a high mattress. If you love to decorate your bed with lots of pillows and throws, it's best to consider a headboard that has more height to better accommodate your needs.   The benefit of having an upholstered bed frame is that it can easily revamp your space and make it look more put-together. "Upholstered beds immediately volumize a bedroom and add a boutique-like visual effect," Shaffer says. He points out that these bed frames also come in price points ranging from affordable to investment and can be mixed and matched with footboards for a more custom look. Shaffer notes that fabric furnishings are susceptible to staining and more wear and tear and recommends having a quality upholstery cleaner on hand, especially one you'd be OK sleeping near.  We've rounded up the best upholstered bed frames and headboards on the market. Whether you're looking for a velvet or fuzzy frame or a frame with storage, we've thought of all the details that will make a significant impact. Even if you're living in a smaller space, an upholstered headboard can do wonders to make a temporary living space look and feel more comfortable. Plus, we found a wide variety of styles to choose from that will elevate your bedroom, from contemporary wingbacks to platform styles and low-profile options. We even included some of PS editors' tried-and-tested picks as well. No matter which upholstered bed frame you choose, you can create a bed that's totally unique to your needs and space with any of these options.
