The Rio Brazilian Steakhouse, which opened its doors in Warrington last November, has since become the highest rated eatery in Cheshire. The restaurant, in the former Prezzo premises at the Golden Square Shopping Centre, was opened on November 26. It is the company's fifth venue, joining its outlets in Jesmond (Newcastle), Middlesbrough, Newcastle Quayside and Durham. The Warrington venue has been well-received, and quickly became Tripadvisor's top-rated restaurant in Warrington, reports CheshireLive.

Special mention to Natalie who served us, very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely recommend and come back!"
