“Seeing as you all like my bikini pictures the most 👙” Salma Hayek is on an Instagram streak—and her follower count proves it. Just days after her nude sauna pic and her sizzling national bikini day photo, Hayek reached a major milestone on the social media platform. And the Magic Mike star is celebrating with a risqué bikini video that fans are going wild over.  “I can’t believe it, 25 million followers! Thank you soo soo much to every single one of you. 🙏 Seeing as you all like my bikini pictures the most 👙, here’s a bikini workout for you all,” the 56-year-old actress captioned the video of her diving into a pool. “I hate exercising—but I love to celebrate good moments dancing in the water. I am genuinely moved and grateful for all your love & support. 🥰” After diving head-first into the pool, Hayek emerges from the water with a smile while bouncing up and down. She begins her workout by standing knee-deep in the water and drawing large circles with her arms and hands, followed by an ab workout and leg lifts. She finished by dancing in the water before resting her head on the edge of the pool and staring into the camera. Needless to say, fans were impressed with Hayek’s video. “Wow that’s the best thing on Instagram today 🥵🥵💥” one fan commented. “The most gorgeous woman in the world,” another added. “Here for the bikini content because I can’t believe this is 50. Wow!” another fan commented. Even Drake chimed in, writing: “Let’s get her to 50M asap.” After watching (and re-watching) Hayek’s video, you might notice that something seems familiar. And that would be the plunging bikini from a recent photo posted to the star’s Instagram grid. Just days ago, Hayek posed in the same string bikini in a pool for National Bikini Day.  “Happy #NationalBikiniDay! 👙Can you believe the bikini has only been around for 77 years?! Let’s hope they don’t ban them too #notathrowback,” Hayek captioned the photo. Hayek is known for posting stunning bikini photos, and she’s proud of it. In 2021, the actress told Entertainment Tonight that she finds posing for swimsuit photos “liberating.” She explained that she worked hard to “lose a lot of weight” after quarantine to raise her confidence back up.  After reaching her goals, she was happy to show off her hard work. “I’m glad I took a lot of pictures, I have no shame on it,” she continued in the interview. “I’m spreading the love out [on Instagram] like every two weeks.” Clearly, Hayek has kept her word—and has accrued more and more followers in the process.
