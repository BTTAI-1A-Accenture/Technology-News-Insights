			Trending:		 ANAHEIM ― Angels manager Phil Nevin said Shohei Ohtani hasn’t had any issues throwing since his most recent start was cut short due to cramping in his right middle finger, and Ohtani’s next pitching appearance will come against the San Francisco Giants on Wednesday night at Angel Stadium.Ohtani threw four shutout innings against the Seattle Mariners on Thursday. He continued to serve as the Angels’ designated hitter after throwing his final pitch and later said he might have been able to pitch another inning, suggesting he left the game more as a precaution.“I felt like it was better for the team to stop pitching,” Ohtani said through his interpreter after Thursday’s game.Any injury to Ohtani would be a major blow to the Angels, who occupy a delicate position in the standings. They entered Saturday’s game 5½ games back of the final American League wild-card spot, needing to leapfrog four teams to clinch a playoff berth with less than two months remaining in the regular season.In the AL West, the Angels are in fourth place, nine games behind the first-place Texas Rangers. The Mariners – who they’ll face Sunday for the final time at home this season – are ahead of the Angels in both races.Ohtani is 9-5 with a 3.32 ERA in 124⅔ innings as a pitcher. By starting Wednesday against the Giants, Ohtani remains on schedule to start one of the Angels’ three games the following week against the Texas Rangers in Arlington.ROSENBERG RETURNSThe Angels designated right-hander Jacob Webb for assignment and selected the contract of left-hander Kenny Rosenberg.It’s the first major league call-up of 2023 for Rosenberg, who made three appearances for the Angels in 2022 and went 0-0 with a 4.22 ERA. He was designated for assignment after last season, returned on a minor league contract, and went 7-7 with a 4.93 ERA in 19 games (19 starts) for Triple-A Salt Lake.

For Webb, who was out of minor league options, it’s an anticlimactic ending to what had been a mostly successful stint with the Angels. After having his contract purchased from Salt Lake on May 21, Webb went 1-1 with a 3.98 ERA in 29 games out of the Angels’ bullpen. He limited opponents to a .197 batting average.However, Webb had struggled since the All-Star break, allowing 11 hits (four home runs), nine walks, and eight runs in 10 innings. Nevin called the decision to cut Webb “extremely” difficult.“He’s done a lot of great things for our club,” Nevin said. “It was a hard conversation here. We talked on the phone last night as well. He gets it. He understands it. He’s a pro. He’s been through it before.”WARD UPDATEOutfielder Taylor Ward had surgery Friday on the orbital bone that was fractured when he was struck in the face by a pitch last weekend in Toronto. Nevin also said Ward had internal splints inserted into his nose.“His vision’s good, no problems there,” Nevin said. “Every eye test he’s gone through, everything is really good. … That’s the biggest positive. We got the best news possible after what had happened.”Ward, 29, is hitting .253 with 14 home runs and 47 RBIs this season.O’HOPPE UPDATELogan O’Hoppe (shoulder) is set to begin a rehabilitation assignment this week at Class-A Inland Empire sometime during the 66ers’ six-game series in Rancho Cucamonga.O’Hoppe hasn’t played since he suffered a torn labrum on April 20, and is on track to return during the initial timetable of 4-6 months.Nevin said O’Hoppe will be eased into a routine before he’s cleared to catch a complete nine-inning game.“It’s like a full spring training buildup for him,” Nevin said.UP NEXTMariners (RHP Bryce Miller, 7-4, 4.35 ERA) at Angels (RHP Chase Silseth, 3-1, 3.99 ERA), Sunday, 1 p.m., Bally Sports West, 830 AMRelated Articles
