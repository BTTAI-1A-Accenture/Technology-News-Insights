Reported By:  Swati Chaturvedi News18.com Last Updated: September 21, 2023, 23:44 IST New Delhi, India Sustainable fashion can be affordable, stylish and planet friendly  Sustainability as a fashion statement represents a contemporary approach to clothing that combines ethical values with style. It emphasizes responsible production, eco-friendly materials, and fair labor practices. By making sustainable choices, individuals can express their commitment to a healthier planet while looking fashionable. This shift towards conscious consumption not only benefits the environment but also supports a more equitable and ethical fashion industry.  Kapil Bhatia, CEO & Founder, UNIREC, says, “Sustainability isn’t just a choice; it’s a reflection of who we are. Ethical and stylish clothing is more than just a fashion statement; it’s a commitment to a better world. We believe that every outfit we wear can tell a story of conscious choices, compassion for the planet, and support for fair labor practices.” In the realm of fashion, fads may come and go, but our unwavering commitment to sustainability should remain constant. It embodies a timeless grace, serving as a means of self-expression that upholds our principles. When we embrace sustainable fashion, we make a conscious choice to minimize our impact on the planet. We select materials that promote environmental well-being, adopt production methods that reduce waste, and endorse brands that prioritize openness and ethical conduct. “Our clothing becomes a canvas upon which we paint our beliefs. It’s a way to showcase our commitment to reducing the fashion industry’s impact on the planet. It’s a reminder that fashion should never come at the cost of human dignity or environmental degradation,” adds Bhatia. As we embrace sustainable fashion, we encourage innovation and creativity. We support brands that use their influence to drive positive change, to inspire others, and to redefine what fashion means in the 21st century. We understand that true style isn’t about fleeting trends; it’s about timeless choices that resonate with our values and endure through time. Sustainability as a fashion statement isn’t just about what we wear; it’s about the impact we create. It’s a pledge to support a brighter, greener, and more equitable future. Together, we can make ethical and stylish clothing the norm, not the exception, because fashion should always be a reflection of our best selves.” Manish Kapoor, MD & CEO, Pepe Jeans India, opines, “At Pepe Jeans, sustainability isn’t just a trend; it’s our fashion statement. We’re dedicated to creating stylish, ethical clothing that speaks volumes about our commitment to the planet and the people who make our clothes. We believe that looking good should go hand in hand with feeling good about what you wear, and we’re here to prove that eco-conscious fashion can be both ethical and chic.” Akshra Dalal, Director, JD Institute of Fashion Technology, says, “In today’s fashion world, sustainability isn’t a passing trend; it’s the essence of the industry. At our fashion institute, we firmly believe that sustainability is fashion’s future – more than just a fad, it’s a resounding declaration of our values and responsibility to our planet and its inhabitants. Our approach to fashion education transcends the superficial; it’s about cultivating a generation of creators, professionals, and visionaries who not only possess the art of crafting chic attire but also uphold ethical and ecological ideals. We perceive fashion as a catalyst for positive change, which is why we’ve dedicated ourselves to embedding sustainability deep within our curriculum. Our students don’t just learn design; they learn design with a purpose. They delve into inventive materials, ethical sourcing, and eco-conscious production methods. They comprehend the ramifications of fast fashion on our environment and society, and they are determined to be part of the remedy.” We empower our students to challenge conventions, question industry norms, and push boundaries in their pursuit of eco-friendly and fashionable garments. “From upcycling and repurposing to embracing sustainable fashion technologies, our institute fosters a culture of creativity harmonized with nature,” adds Dalal. In today’s context, fashion isn’t solely about looking good; it’s about feeling good about your choices as a consumer or designer, knowing they can be transformative. Sustainability is more than just a fashion statement; it’s an emblem of our commitment to forging a greener, more stylish future. Dalal believes, “As we nurture the next generation of fashion leaders, we have unwavering confidence that they’ll redefine not only style but also the industry’s ecological footprint. Sustainability isn’t merely an abstract concept for them; it’s an ethos, a dynamic statement of their pledge to fashion’s brighter, eco-conscious future.”
