NatWest will close 34 additional sites between September 2023 and July 2024, while sister bank RBS will shut two branches in November 2023 - see the list of new closures below NatWest Group has announced another 36 more branch closures as high street banks continue to disappear. In an update today, NatWest said it will close 34 additional sites between September 2023 and July 2024. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) will shut two branches in November 2023. It means the total number of NatWest branches scheduled to close this year and into 2024 stands at 140, while the figure for RBS is four. If you need face-to-face support and your bank is shutting, it is worth seeing if a NatWest mobile branch or community pop-up bank is available near you. Mobile branches can be used for basic services, like making deposits and withdrawing cash, while pop-up banks can help you manage online banking and give you information about products and services. NatWest also works with other UK banks to open shared banking hubs on a set day each week, where again you can use basic services. You can find your nearest mobile branch or banking hub on the NatWest website. You can also access certain facilities at Post Office branches including cash and cheque deposits, checking your balance and withdrawing cash. A NatWest spokesperson said: “As with many industries, most of our customers are shifting to mobile and online banking, because it’s faster and easier for people to manage their financial lives.  “We understand and recognise that digital solutions aren’t right for everyone or every situation, and that when we close branches we have to make sure that no one is left behind. “We take our responsibility seriously to support the people who face challenges in moving online, so we are investing to provide them with support and alternatives that work for them.” You can see all the previously announced NatWest and RBS closures here and the new ones confirmed today are below.
