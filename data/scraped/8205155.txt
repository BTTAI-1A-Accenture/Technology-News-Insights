CEO, Co-founder of Orbita.VC.   It has become commonplace that aspiring founders should first identify product demand by researching similar offerings. After all, if competitors abound, then clearly, a market exists. Yet, such a market environment is a double-edged sword. Although the presence of competitors signals the presence of potential buyers, it also means there is an array of similar solutions tackling the same problem. When you realize that, it is important not to veer toward the pitfall of striving for a wholly unique product idea, hoping to stand out from the competition. Although in theory, this approach might appear savvy, it’s fraught with considerable risks such as prolonged development timelines, inflated costs and potential misinterpretations of market demand. My consistent recommendation has been to refine an existing product rather than crafting an entirely new one. This tactic allows founders to mitigate the aforementioned risks and expedite product launches. However, a saturated competitive landscape demands a more stringent evaluation of your startup idea. There are five crucial metrics for an initial appraisal of a startup concept: market size, revenue potential, visibility, future capitalization and ease of competition. Market size is the foundational parameter for your startup concept. It can best be described as the total value of products measured in terms of generated revenue. Without calculating the market size, you can’t create a feasible business plan, which serves as a springboard for your operations management and a blueprint for potential investors Methodologies for estimating market size span a spectrum. A top-down approach could be employed, initiating with broad statistical data derived from industry reports and research papers. A bottom-up analysis, instead, begins by examining individual potential customers and extrapolating to estimate the total market. There is also a value theory approach, defining market size based on the perceived value of a product or service to its potential customers. It is up to you to choose the appropriate method, but keep in mind that you should look at billion-size markets. Otherwise, the potential investors’ interest in your startup will be limited. Revenue potential represents the zenith of an organization’s financial ambition—the highest possible sales revenue achievable, assuming a hypothetical total market share. This utopian scenario serves as a critical benchmark and a quantifiable goal driving business operations. For startup founders, revenue potential functions as a navigational tool. It informs the refinement of operational efficiency, the initiation of marketing campaigns and the design of sales strategies. VCs use this metric to appraise a business’s worth and calculate the potential return on investment (ROI). Like market size, the revenue potential is a many-headed beast that can be measured differently. I suggest an easy top-down algorithm: • Assess total addressable market (TAM): This is the total annual revenue you could make if you achieved 100% market share in your industry. • Measure your projected market share—serviceable available market (SAM)—based on TAM. Say, for instance, you target a niche with a TAM of $1 billion. If you believe your company can achieve 10% market share, the revenue potential would be $100 million. • Double-check the above figure. Measure serviceable and obtainable market (SOM) based on the current resources, pricing strategy and conversion rates. For instance, if you estimate that your current workforce can only secure 50 sales per month, your SOM would be equal to the value of SAM minus 12 x (50*X), where X is your product’s price. Visibility, or market presence, captures a measure of a business’s familiarity with its target demographic. It encapsulates brand awareness across the broad spectrum of media. Solid visibility correlates positively with market share and revenue potential. Visibility is often not the strongest aspect for early-stage startups due to their limited financial resources and time constraints, which makes it challenging to capture the attention of potential customers. However, assessing audience growth rates and expenditures in this area can provide insights into a startup’s performance in terms of visibility. Evaluating visibility can involve analyzing web traffic, social media metrics (followers, shares and mentions) and online and offline media mentions. To convert this data into meaningful numbers, it is necessary to calculate the corresponding expenses that would typically be incurred for achieving the given rate of visibility. Future capitalization is a projection of a company’s total value at a future point in time. It’s calculated by multiplying the predicted future share price by the expected number of shares outstanding at that future time. Future capitalization is a crucial metric for startups, as it plays a vital role in strategic planning and investment decisions. It enables companies to anticipate their potential growth trajectory and make informed decisions about resource allocation, strategic investments and business scaling. To gauge future capitalization, you should thoroughly understand potential market growth, competitive landscape and macroeconomic conditions. Alternatively, you can refer to the valuations of established businesses in your niche and consider half of that as your prospective capitalization. Ease of competition provides a snapshot of the feasibility of market entry and the potential to establish a competitive stronghold. This metric is influenced by various factors, including the number of existing competitors, their resources, barriers to entry, customer loyalty and the degree of uniqueness of the product or service offering. A high ease of competition score signifies a market with lower barriers to entry, less entrenched competitors and abundant differentiation opportunities. Conversely, low ease of competition typically characterizes a saturated market, replete with significant entry costs and dominated by a few, often large, players. To measure ease of competition, you can implement analytical frameworks such as Porter’s Five Forces Model. Porter’s model factors in five parameters of competition: intensity of current competition, the threat of new entrants into the industry, the threat of substitute products, the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining leverage of customers.
