Blizzard teases the new support-class hero ahead of his official unveiling by  Michael McWhertor Overwatch 2’s next hero is Lifeweaver, a support-class character who will debut in season 4 of Blizzard Entertainment’s free-to-play shooter. Lifeweaver’s design incorporates lotus flowers; he appears to be holding one in his primary fire hand and wears mandala-style petals on his back. The character seems to be of Thai origin, based on his dress and the prang that appears behind him in an officially released screenshot. Also, he’s hot! In a new gameplay video released Tuesday, Blizzard showed off some of Lifeweaver’s abilities, including a charged healing blossom that can restore allies’ HP and a grab move that can pull allies toward him to save them from danger. Lifeweaver can also summon a flower-shaped platform; in the above video, we see him place it under an Orisa that’s using its ultimate, effectively nullifying that hero’s Terra Surge ability. Lifeweaver’s own ultimate lets him summon a large tree-shaped object that heals allies and provides overhead cover. Lifeweaver will be the 37th hero on Overwatch 2’s roster, and the ninth support hero. Blizzard has pledged to fill out the support roster further with new hero additions in Overwatch 2, after the release of the tank Ramattra and support character Kiriko since the game launched in October. Season 4 of Overwatch 2 is expected to launch April 11. Lifeweaver will likely be released as part of the game’s next battle pass, as previous heroes have, and will not be immediately available to play in the game’s competitive modes. Overwatch 2 is available now on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X. Update (April 4): This story has been updated with a new video for Lifeweaver showing off his abilities. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. © 2024 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved
