Andy Dunn is returning to Bonobos, the upscale fashion retail business he co-founded in 2007. He ran that business for its first 10 years until it was sold to Walmart for $310 million in 2017. Dunn took a senior vice president role at Walmart at that time but only stayed two years. Walmart sold Bonobos earlier this year in a $75 million deal with WHP Global and Express who partnered for the acquisition that was completed in May.  According to a WHP release, Dunn and WHP Global will work in partnership with Tim Baxter, the CEO of EXPR, and John Hutchinson, president of Bonobos. “As the co-founder of Bonobos and a retail innovator, Andy has a unique perspective that we are fortunate to have access to as we work with WHP Global to begin the next chapter of growth for Bonobos,” said Baxter. Bonobos was founded as an online retailer. But later expanded into brick-and-mortar, opening showroom-style stores (“guideshops”) where customers can try on clothes and order them online. Since leaving Walmart, Dunn founded Red Swan Ventures, an angel venture capitalist fund that has backed more than 120 startups, according to his profile on social media site LinkedIn. “Getting back into the mix at Bonobos is a magical, full-circle moment,” said Dunn noted in the release. WHP Global and EXPR will be exceptional brand stewards. In partnership with the strong leadership team at Bonobos, we’re going to do great things on behalf of current and future Bonobos customers.” Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand
