We reserve the right to decline filming requests, including documentary requests. The British Library is continuing to experience some disruption to services caused by a cyber-attack. This means that not all collection items can be made immediately available for filming purposes at this moment. Please contact the Press Office for more information. We have pre-recorded footage of the British Libraryâs spaces available on request. Please contact the Press Office to enquire about using this footage. Visitors to the British Library are welcome to take photographs in our public areas using handheld devices (no tripods or trailing cables) for non-commercial use but flash photography should be avoided around the King's Library.
