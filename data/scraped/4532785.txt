One said construction was planned to start by mid-year, it added.  This would further expand BYD's parent company's presence in Vietnam, where its electronic unit produces solar panels. The auto-giant has been aggressively expanding elsewhere in Asia, including Singapore and Japan, along with Europe.  The development comes months after the company announced in September that it would build an EV assembly plant in Thailand with an annual capacity of 150,000 cars from 2024.
