Here are a few tips for finding the best rates in New York. Before you start looking for car coverage, know the state minimum car insurance requirements. The minimum coverage required by the state of New York is: New York is a no-fault state, which means your insurance company will pay your medical bills and cover lost wages regardless of who’s at fault for an accident. There are certain things you should consider before getting car insurance quotes and purchasing coverage from an insurance agent. Where you live and who you’re insuring will play big roles in determining what types of coverage you get and how much of each you’ll need. For example, if you live in an area of New York that gets blizzards each winter, consider buying comprehensive coverage to protect your car from potential weather-related damage. Comprehensive insurance also protects drivers who live in cities with high rates of auto theft.  Teen drivers are more likely to get into car accidents, so if you want to insure your teen driver’s car, PIP insurance will take care of any injuries that happen. Collision insurance will cover damages to your teen’s vehicle. Lenders and lessors often require more car insurance coverage than the state of New York does. If you’re financing or leasing your vehicle, you may have to purchase a full-coverage policy. Based on data from Quadrant Information Services, the average cost of a full-coverage auto insurance policy in New York is $232 per month or $2,783 per year. This is about 61% more expensive than the national average of $1,730 per year. These averages are for a married 35-year-old driver with a good credit score and a clean driving record.

When you’re looking for the best cheap car insurance, ask insurers about available discounts. Here are some of the most common car insurance discounts in New York. Most major car insurance companies offer savings of at least 10% to students who maintain a B grade average or above. Since car insurance premiums are often highest for young drivers, find out whether you or your teen driver qualifies for this discount. To encourage drivers to take as many safety precautions as possible, many providers offer price breaks to car owners who install anti-theft devices like car alarms and glass-break sensors. Large insurance companies often have millions of policies. Printing materials and bills for each policy adds up, so many providers have started offering discounts to customers who choose to go paperless and set up automatic payments online.
