 Speaking on the success of the event, Dr Rishi Bhatnagar, Chair-IET Future Tech Panel said, "The advent of future technologies is here and embracing them is unavoidable. For instance, the automotive industry will be 80% software and only 20% hardware, not too long into the future. We are increasingly moving towards hyper-personalisation and hyper-localisation, and businesses are in dire need of a technology roadmap to navigate challenges that the future will bring. The IET Future Tech Congress 2022 truly brought together policy makers, academia, industry experts, business leaders and start-ups on a single platform to discuss this theme. It was wonderful to see the excitement over the two days, with discussions spanning across the entire lifecycle of future technologies - from innovation to implementation to advancement."Siemens, a leading technology firm focused on industry, infrastructure, transport, and healthcare, was the presenting partner for the event. The event also featured other prominent organisations as partners, such as Applied Materials (Material Engineering Partner), India-EU ICT Standardisation Collaboration (Standardisation Partner), Hexagon (Digital Reality Partner), Aeris (Associate Partner), Kairon (Conversational AI Partner), Spykke (Charging Partner), Ultra Human (Health & Fitness Partner), India Blockchain Forum, India Smart Grid Forum, Kassia, NASSCOM: Centre of Excellence-IoT & AI, IB Hubs, Indian American Chamber of Commerce (IACC), Broadband India Forum (BIF), AREA and ETSI.The Technology sector is one of the biggest growth enablers for the Indian economy. It accounted for 7.25% of Indian GDP in 2022 and is expected to contribute 10% by 2025. The IET Future Tech Congress is an effort by the IET to highlight the innovations taking place in the space and chart out a roadmap for the future of technology advancement in India. Through the event, the IET hopes to educate and inform prominent stakeholders about future trends and best practices that can be adopted to manoeuvre the ever-changing landscape of the industry. The next edition of the IET Future Tech Congress will be held on 21st September 2023, and further details will be updated on the official IET website and social media handles. The IET is one of the world's largest engineering institutions with over 168,000 members in 150 countries. It is also the most multidisciplinary-reflecting the increasingly diverse nature of engineering in the 21st century.
