 Thanks to the release of ChatGPT, 2023 has been the year of AI.  Importantly for hiring, AI tools like ChatGPT have created new jobs that didn’t exist a year ago – and that you can’t get a qualification for. This poses a challenge for hiring managers, who now have to figure out how to recruit for these new positions. Another nail in the coffin of degree requirements, perhaps? To navigate this evolving job market and identify AI-savvy talent, organizations need to think innovatively and adapt their hiring practices. As usual, skills-based hiring presents itself as a stunningly simple solution to this modern recruitment challenge!  Let’s get into it 🤖 AI language models like ChatGPT have revolutionized human-machine interactions with their uncanny ability to understand and generate human-like text, creating a shakeup in the world of work.  One 2023 study predicts the loss of 300 million full-time jobs to automation. But the same report predicts an annual US productivity increase of nearly 1.5% over the next decade as a result of the mass implementation of AI tools.  The economic impact could be substantial, with AI potentially increasing annual global GDP by 7%. If it lives up to expectations, the impact of generative AI on the workforce will be immense, and many people are concerned that language models like ChatGPT could take their jobs.  👉 Hint: They won’t if employers learn to hire for skills in the era of AI 👀 As machines start to take on repetitive tasks, it’s on humans to make sure AI tools are used intelligently, effectively, and responsibly. As interest in using AI to increase productivity continues to grow, a range of jobs are emerging that require a blend of new and existing skills. Here are seven roles that will emerge in an AI-powered future of work. A prompt engineer specializes in designing and refining precise text strings that optimize AI training and produce desired outcomes. They have to be familiar with the nuances specific to different generative AI models. The demand for prompt engineers extends beyond tech companies, including sectors like law firms, customer support, and publishing. You can even purchase or sell prompts on online marketplaces like PromptBase, underscoring the importance of human expertise in this area. 💵 Salary range: $250,000-$335,000 annually Product managers are now among the top users of AI in organizations, with 21% working with AI on a daily basis. AI product managers use their technical expertise to maximize the potential of AI-powered products. They not only identify market needs and develop product strategies but also utilize their in-depth knowledge of AI and machine learning algorithms to aid in the product development process.  When it comes to skills, AI product managers need to be well-versed in AI tools and possess technical expertise, as well as skills like effective communication and risk management.  AI product leader Marily Nika, believes that all product managers will be AI product managers eventually.  Product managers: be prepared!  💵 Salary range: $123,000-$172,000 annually Human-machine interaction designers work to facilitate seamless communication between AI systems and the people that use them. They combine expertise in user-centered design, cognitive psychology, and interaction design to ensure smooth and engaging interactions with AI systems.  Key skills include a deep understanding of user-centered design principles, proficiency in design software, and knowledge of AI capabilities and limitations. This role is important because enjoyable human-AI interactions will boost the general acceptance of AI systems. Here’s to less intimidating, easy-to-implement AI! 🤖 💵 Salary range: $90,000-$122,000 annually Producing impressive and interesting responses isn’t enough for language models like ChatGPT: It’s also crucial the output is accurate and unbiased. The role of an AI auditor is to actively assess AI systems for biases, errors, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. Auditors examine generated content for accuracy, fairness, and adherence to guidelines.  💵 Salary range: £28,000-£52,000 annually (UK) As the impact of AI grows, the machines themselves will need to learn how to follow AI instructions. This is where machine managers come in. Their job is to supervise teams of engineers, collaborate cross-functionally with other departments, and oversee AI-operated hardware and systems.  By leveraging the distinct expertise of machine managers in supervising AI systems, organizations will be able to improve performance, reduce downtime, and effectively tackle technical issues as they emerge.  Given the complexity of this position, job descriptions for machine managers typically require a computer science degree and relevant experience in the specific field where AI is applied. 💵 Salary range: $109,000-$251,000 annually Even though AI systems automate content generation, they may still produce errors, biases, or inappropriate content. The role of a content moderator is to review and verify such AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and uphold community guidelines. Content moderators possess expertise in understanding context, cultural nuances, and sensitive subjects. Their feedback and insights can improve the overall quality, safety, and reliability of AI-generated content, ensuring a more trustworthy and valuable user experience.  They’ll play an important role in sectors like social media, online marketplaces, and content platforms. 💵 Salary range: $31,400-$41,600 annually AI ethicists, or ethics experts, are responsible for guiding the ethical development and deployment of AI technologies. They analyze the ethical impact of AI-generated content and propose guidelines to address biases or harmful outcomes.  Different industries, particularly technology and research organizations, are looking for AI ethicists to guide businesses and stakeholders in making ethical decisions, protecting user privacy, ensuring fairness, and promoting responsible AI use. AI ethics experts are in demand and can earn high salaries due to the increasing need for responsible and ethical use of generative AI.  💵 Salary range: $70,000-$173,000 annually While well-defined qualifications don’t yet exist for these positions, there are still a few ways for hiring managers to seek candidates with the right mix of skills. Up first, our favorite – skills-based hiring 🥇 By focusing on skills rather than degrees or resumes, employers can access the untapped potential of individuals who may have the relevant abilities but lack role-specific professional experience because the job they’re seeking didn’t exist before.  It’s now common for companies to use AI-related tasks as part of the skills-based hiring process, to find candidates who are willing to learn and adapt to these new technologies.  Julia Pollak, the chief economist at ZipRecruiter, notes that tasks related to AI are commonly used as part of skills assessments.  ZipRecruiter asked applicants to “describe how you think tools like ChatGPT might affect your role over time” or to “include with your application a ChatGPT-generated story a 7-year-old might enjoy and the prompt you used to generate it.”  With new skills emerging, employers have the opportunity to hire for them without the biases that haunt the way we hire today. The candidates with the best AI skills might be the ones you’d never suspect. New skills ➡️new (skills-based hiring)? Next up: By upskilling and reskilling current employees, employers cultivate AI capabilities within their organizations.  This approach saves the time and resources involved in external hiring for AI-related skills. You don’t need to be looking to fill new jobs to train your employees on new AI technology. You can invest in ongoing learning and development (L&D) for existing staff to ensure your business and team stay competitive. After all, we can win by using AI to excel at the jobs we’re already doing, too. These shiny new roles will indeed be difficult for HR managers to fill. But by adopting a skills-based approach to hiring, employers can tap into a diverse talent pool and build a workforce that excels in AI-driven settings – without the biases that creep in when you hire traditionally. To complement this, investing in upskilling and reskilling bridges AI skills gaps, keeping companies agile in the era of AI. Whatever your stance on AI, TestGorilla is here to help you navigate tried, true, and eternal human skills (like communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking), and the flashy new skills of an AI-driven future.
