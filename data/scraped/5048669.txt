 In highly populated cities, sometimes the access to your home may not make it easy to move big furniture, but with CORKBRICK, you can easily transport the individual and lightweight blocks to the desired location in your home and quickly assemble the structure or furniture piece you need. Corkbrick is an eco-friendly material. Its production uses up to 95% less energy than traditional building materials, and it’s made from sustainable cork oak forests that continue to grow for centuries without needing replanting.  Corkbrick is extremely durable.
