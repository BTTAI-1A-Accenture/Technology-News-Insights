Japanese markets rocketed in early trading to extend their recent rally towards a new 33-year high. This performance set the tone for much of Europe early in the session, with a new record for the German Dax amid hopes of progress regarding US debt ceiling talks. In London, housebuilders were among those to drag on the wider market as UK gilt yields lifted. The FTSE 100 moved 0.19%, or 14.57 points higher to finish at 7,756.87. The Dax rose by 0.69% and the Cac 40 increased by 0.61% at the close as a result. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “Markets in Europe have seen another day of strong gains after the Nikkei 225 closed at its highest levels since 1990 and finished the week higher by 4.8%. “This momentum translated into the European session, with the German Dax taking up the challenge and posting a new record high above 16,300, with the gains being driven by optimism that markets would have one less thing to worry about next week, with respect to a successful resolution of US debt ceiling negotiations. “The FTSE 100 has once again been the laggard with weakness in the retail and construction sector.” Stateside, the US markets built further momentum as they picked up from Thursday’s positive tone. Meanwhile, sterling swung back to gains against the dollar but has had a shaky week ahead of a key inflation update for April due next week. The pound was up 0.41% to 1.245 US dollars and up by 0.07% to 1.152 euros at market close in London.
