We use technology to exchange information, wash our clothes, pay our bills, prepare our meals and travel from one place to another. Moreover, with the internet becoming highly accessible and affordable in recent years, people are now opting to engage with banks and other financial service providers through various online platforms. This is where open banking enters the scenario to weave an interconnected ecosystem of customers, businesses, and financial institutions for easy transactions. The last few years have witnessed unprecedented growth in adopting open banking. This system allows third-party financial service providers to access customer banking and financial data with their permission through open application programming interfaces (APIs). Digital disruption poses a challenge for the future of financial services, and the advent of open banking is paving the way for third-party developers to build services to cater to the financial needs of customers. Using APIs will ensure that the data is transferred through fast and reliable connections. How will open banking shape the future of financial services?  Open banking is reshaping the financial services sector through financial inclusions, technology, and the introduction of new financial tools.
