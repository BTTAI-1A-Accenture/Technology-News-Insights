The Department of Transport’s Road Traffic Infrastructure Management Center said Friday it is finalizing the specific location and would soon submit the proposal to the city government. In January last year Bach Dang Wharf Park reopened to the public after a year’s renovation work. It attracts many visitors, but pedestrians find it difficult to access it from Nguyen Hue. Last April the city approved a plan to build a tunnel under Ton Duc Thang Street to link Nguyen Hue Street and Bach Dang park. The tunnel would be part of a larger plan to build an underground area in the city's downtown. But now related units said it would be easier and faster to build a footbridge. After the bridge is put into service, the city would continue with the plan to build the tunnel.
