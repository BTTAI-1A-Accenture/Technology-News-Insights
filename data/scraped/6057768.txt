 Following on from Interview Tips Part 1: for interviewees, this time we’re turning the tables with of my top tips and tried-and-tested interview questions for when you’re the one doing the hiring.  Let’s take it as read that you’ll be asking very specific questions about the nitty gritty of the role, drilling deep into the technical skills, past examples and future scenarios…  The questions below are designed to top and tail your interview, getting to know the real person behind the resume. So, set your Slack status to ‘away’ and let’s get down to interview town! If you haven’t had much hiring experience before, it’s easy for interviews to blur when you’re talking about the same thing every time across days or even weeks. One of my favorite tricks is to give every interview a score out of 10. You could do this overall or by question. Trust me – it will really help when you can't quite remember who said what. For the last role I had the pleasure of hiring, my colleague and I individually scored each candidate, which made it super easy to agree on the top second round of interviews.   I’m naturally a very trusting person, and it’s only through the experience of conducting many, MANY interviews that I have learned not to simply believe someone can do something just because they say they can It’s not about being cynical or untrusting; interviews are naturally where people sell themselves, so how do you tell if someone can actually do the thing? Asking a lot of ‘how’ questions can help (“Can you talk me through how you did X?”) but a skills test can often cut through the noise. A copywriting exercise, design task, or technical skills test on a platform like testgorilla.com or a custom test on Google Forms can help you compare apples with apples between your candidates.  Note: if  you use a pre-set test, always take the test yourself to know if there are any tricky questions and set a baseline for the results.  If you have a small team or if this is a crucial hire, why not introduce your top candidates to the team for their buy-in and to get a glimpse at how they would fit in? It can be as simple as a quick office or Zoom hello, or a casual coffee. You’re all going to be spending up to 40 hours a week with this person, and a bad cultural hire can really throw things off balance for everyone, not to mention take a lot of time to bounce back from.   I’ll never forget being asked this question when I went for my first interview at Youfoodz. I was also asked what I was watching on TV at that time (pretty sure it was Game of Thrones). This is still my favourite ice-breaker. It really warms people up and gets them chatting. Just make sure you reign it in so there’s time for the actual questions! Another great question to throw out early as it can help your candidate shake off their nerves by reminding them about all the great stuff they've done.  It’s really lovely to see people beaming with pride as they share their shining moments with you. This question will show you what drives the individual and what kind of impact they could have on your business. This is an especially good question to ask if you will be managing the person as it will tell you how much effort you need to invest up front in establishing a productive working relationship.  This question will show you if the candidate is self-aware enough to know what kind of support would see them succeed in their role, whether it’s pep talks and high-fives or a more calm and collaborative approach.  Start-ups generally live by the ‘run fast, break sh*t’ mantra: it’s better to mess things up and fix them fast rather than not try at all. Mistakes happen, but it’s the ‘fixing’ part that ensures you still end up ahead. This question uncovers your candidate’s ability to own a mistake, their initiative to problem solve, and honesty in their response. If you’ve read this far, ask me about the biggest mistake I ever made which nearly cost a business a cool quarter of a mill. True story.  I love asking this question for marketing hires. If it’s not Threads launching, it’s the roll-out of GA4 or yet another change to Meta’s data privacy. The game changes for us every day in marketing, but we still have to keep playing and learning the new rules as we go! Keeping up with industry trends shows you’re resourceful, proactive about finding fresh ideas and naturally curious. This is my #1 sought-after skill in candidates; it’s a hard quality to define, but this question can show you whether your candidate has that curiosity ‘it factor’.  If this is a role where priorities can suddenly shift or you need someone who can keep a lot of plates spinning at once, ask this question.  Whether it’s colour-coded task boards, calendar blocking or time management apps, true multi-taskers should be able to share their secrets to mastering multiple demands.  Anyone who thinks “hang on, there’s a better way to do this” will THRIVE in the start-up world.  This question will immediately highlight if you have an innovator on your hands. These people are naturally adaptable to change, have amazing critical thinking skills, and love driving positive change within their teams or businesses.  When there’s an especially big mountain to climb it can be hard to get started and keep on trekking when the terrain gets tough. Staying motivated is a challenge for everyone, but what you’re really trying to figure out here is: are you going to have to push this person up the mountain every day to make sure the job is done, or are they self-motivated enough to hike on ahead without you holding their hand every step of the way?  Asking this question will give you a peek into your candidate’s self-awareness and foresight. Have they actually pictured themselves in this role, anticipated the potential obstacles or areas where they might need to upskill? And are they honest enough to share that with you? Say you have two candidates: one who ticks almost all of the boxes but has a can-do attitude and an enthusiasm to grow, and one who has all the skills but a fixed mindset and believes they have nothing left to learn. Who are you hiring? I’d hire for attitude over aptitude any day. Not only will this question give you a sense of your interviewee’s keenness, you’ll easily be able to tell if they’ve done their research. The ideas they share will tell you about their thinking: where do they think the biggest growth opportunities lie? And do you agree? This is a great question to either start or end your interview with. Get your candidate to whip out the crystal ball and share what they see in your future together. This could be the start of a beautiful working relationship.
