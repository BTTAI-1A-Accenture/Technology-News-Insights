 In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, organizations and individuals strive to harness the potential of information technology (IT). As an organizational change management teacher and practitioner, I have encountered numerous instances where people have been told that information technology has no inherent value. This statement, though provocative, is often misunderstood, and I intend to shed light on its true meaning, emphasizing the importance of context and the need for human input in deriving value from IT.  At first glance, the phrase “information technology has no inherent value” may seem counterintuitive. After all, our world is rapidly evolving due to technological advancements, making IT a cornerstone of modern business operations. However, the phrase does not dismiss the importance of technology. Instead, it highlights the need for understanding that technology alone cannot be the sole driver of value creation. To appreciate the significance of this statement, we must first grasp the concept of “inherent value.” Inherent value refers to an object or concept’s value by virtue of its very existence, independent of external factors or human intervention. When applied to IT, the idea is that technology, in and of itself, does not generate value. Instead, the application of technology in a specific context, coupled with human ingenuity and effort, leads to value creation. Now, let’s explore why embracing the “no inherent value” principle is essential in our digital age. When organizations and individuals acknowledge that IT has no inherent value, they are more likely to scrutinize technology investments critically. This approach encourages decision-makers to carefully assess a particular technology's potential benefits and drawbacks, ultimately leading to better-informed decisions that maximize the return on investment. By recognizing that IT has no inherent value, we acknowledge the essential role of human input in unlocking its potential. This understanding fosters an appreciation for the skills, creativity, and expertise people bring to the table, driving organizations to invest in developing their workforce alongside their technology infrastructure. When we accept that IT has no inherent value, we become more adaptable and resilient in the face of change. This mindset prepares organizations to pivot their strategies and adapt their technology use as the world evolves, ensuring they remain competitive in the ever-changing digital landscape. The “no inherent value” principle encourages a more responsible approach to technology adoption. By understanding that technology is not inherently valuable, decision-makers are more likely to assess their technology choices’ potential social, environmental, and ethical implications, leading to more sustainable and responsible practices. When the focus shifts from the inherent value of IT to the potential value derived from its application, organizations are more likely to prioritize meaningful technology integration. This perspective promotes the development of innovative solutions that address real-world problems and deliver tangible benefits to users rather than chasing the latest tech trends for their own sake. The phrase “information technology has no inherent value” does not dismiss technology’s importance. Instead, it serves as a reminder that technology alone cannot create value; the application of technology, combined with human ingenuity and effort, generates actual value. By embracing this principle, organizations can cultivate critical thinking, emphasize the importance of human input, develop adaptability and resilience, promote responsible technology use, and prioritize meaningful technology integration. It is time for us to stop viewing the “no inherent value” principle as a provocative statement meant to undermine the significance of IT. Instead, let’s appreciate it. Objection 1: The phrase “information technology has no inherent value” downplays the significance of technology in modern society and business. Response: The phrase does not diminish the importance of technology. Instead, it emphasizes that technology alone cannot create value. The application of technology in a specific context, coupled with human input and effort, unlocks its potential and generates value. Objection 2: Claiming that IT has no inherent value could discourage organizations from investing in technology. Response: The purpose of this statement is not to deter technology investments but to encourage organizations to critically evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of technology choices. By doing so, they can make informed decisions that maximize the return on investment and ensure the technology is used effectively and meaningfully. Objection 3: The idea that IT has no inherent value contradicts technology’s exponential growth and impact on our lives. Response: The phrase does not negate the transformative power of technology. Instead, it highlights the fact that the value generated by technology is due to its application in a specific context and the human effort and creativity behind it. The impact of technology on our lives is a testament to the successful combination of these factors. Objection 4: The article suggests that adaptability and resilience are consequences of understanding that IT has no inherent value, but these qualities can be developed independently of this perspective. Response: While adaptability and resilience can be developed independently, acknowledging that IT has no inherent value reinforces these qualities. When organizations understand that technology’s value is context-dependent, they are more prepared to pivot their strategies and adapt their technology use as the world evolves, ensuring they remain competitive in the ever-changing digital landscape. Objection 5: The “no inherent value” principle can lead to a negative mindset towards technology and hinder innovation. Response: The principle is not meant to create a negative mindset towards technology. Instead, it encourages a more thoughtful and purposeful approach to technology adoption, fostering innovation that addresses real-world problems and delivers tangible benefits to users rather than chasing the latest tech trends for their own sake. By understanding that technology’s value is derived from its application and human input, organizations are better equipped to create meaningful and impactful innovations.
