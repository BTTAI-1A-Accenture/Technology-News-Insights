WEATHER ALERT Lauren Kelly, Houston Life Correspondent Published: February 10, 2023 at 2:51 PM Lauren Kelly, Houston Life Correspondent HOUSTON – Because nothing makes a heartbeat faster than a roach… (ain’t that the truth!) The Houston Museum of Natural Science is offering guests the chance to showcase their love for their special someone this Valentine’s Day, but it’s definitely not with flowers or chocolates. As a matter of fact, this is probably something more for your EX! Give your loved one (or EX, loved one) the ultimate symbol of endless love this year with…a hissing cockroach. Dedicate your roach and ‘Endless Love’ now through February 14th at the Heartbreak Motel, which is located inside the museum gift shop. The $10 cockroach valentine includes a certificate and commemorative pin. ‘Heartbreak Motel’ proceeds will benefit the Cockrell Butterfly Center at HMNS.
