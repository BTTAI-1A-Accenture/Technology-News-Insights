12. How we test This is important because while mobile apps may have been traditionally associated with information and gaming, business apps are now an essential part for many everyday business operations. This is underlined by the easy availability of smartphones and BYOD (Bring You Own Device) work policies with MDM (Mobile Device Management) solutions in place, which means that employees can now use their iPhones or Android phones for general business process, covering everything from productivity apps to collaborative software apps.  The technology continues to develop, with the increasing availability of augmentation and machine-learning options to provide additional layers of information and communications into your digital services. Whether for marketing services, retail, product development and deployment, as well as Software as a Service (SaaS), app development has come of age. The market reflects this, with a huge number of companies out there that will offer to design and code apps, not just for iOS or Android, but also smart TV's, game consoles, and other hardware, as well as software solutions.  However, there are also software development platforms available to create white label apps from basic templates and configurations. These aim to make it easy for businesses to create their own in-house apps as required, or even create apps for the open market. Below we feature the best mobile app development software platforms currently available. We've also highlighted the best laptops for programming. Why you can trust TechRadar
