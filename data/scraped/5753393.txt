The Echo’s Ian Doyle shared the update in question on Tuesday evening, with the club understood to be rewarding the player’s remarkable progress following on from his summer switch last year.  – martes, 19 de septiembre de 2023 The ex-Celtic prodigy has made just the one appearance in a brief cameo away at Stamford Bridge at the start of the season, though the expectation is that he will play a more pivotal part in the campaign in the upcoming group stages of the Europa League.

Doak looked one of the more exciting prospects in our arsenal in pre-season, with his second-half showing against Darmstadt, in particular, proof of what a promising talent we have at our disposal. He’s one we’ll want to carefully nurture, of course, as a young teenager, though there’s no reason why we shouldn’t all feel a little giddy at the prospect of the Scot racing towards his man down the right flank in Austria. A real throwback of a player, it has to be said, though one surely destined to be Liverpool’s future if he can maintain his upward trajectory. 🚨 EOTK Insider with Neil Jones: Liverpool’s challenge before January transfer window, mentality monsters back?
