A total of six MoUs or LOIs were signed at the Singapore-China Trade and Investment Forum (SCTIF) at Crowne Plaza Shanghai Hongqiao during the 5th CIIE which was held from Nov 5 to Nov 10, the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) revealed. As a high-level bilateral business platform, the forum aims to foster dialogue and greater collaboration between Singapore and Chinese companies. An agreement between SP Group and the Municipal Government of Dezhou City, Shandong Province has been signed to reduce pollution and develop renewable energy. SP Group promises to build Photovoltaics power stations to support the replacement of old growth drivers in Dezhou. Public service operation enterprise Shanghai E&P International Inc will collaborate with Singapore-based CrimsonLogic, letting merchants and logistics service providers in China export to ASEAN countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore easier. This collaboration is significant in strengthening trade and investment ties between the two countries and with the greater Yangtze River Delta region. Other collaborations such as promoting the digital transformation of the music education industry, the cultural understanding between local and international students and online growth partners for consumer goods in China have all been signed at the SCTIF.
