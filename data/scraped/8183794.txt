		 LLC services are designed to help save you time, and — in the world of business — time is money. While you’ll pay a fee to have them take some of the more onerous parts of creating an LLC off your plate, they may ultimately even save you money. The right company will search for ways to reduce filing costs and will also make sure you don’t commit errors that could lead to your filing being rejected. The best LLC services will also provide you with additional services to make sure creating your LLC goes as smoothly as possible and that you have access to the resources and extras you need, like building a professional website for your company or providing employee identification numbers.

We use a data-driven methodology to determine each rating. Advertisers do not influence our editorial content. You can read more about our methodology below. Rocket Lawyer is a good option for business owners who require a significant amount of legal advice while establishing their LLC (or may require it in the future). This includes the drafting of legal documents — Rocket Lawyer offers clients the ability to draw up legal documents for hundreds of purposes. The company also allows customers to seek legal advice at any time, by phone, email or the online chat function on its website, and promises a response within a single business day. That said, for those who don’t require significant legal assistance, Rocket Lawyer’s services, which are available primarily through its two membership tiers, Rocket Legal and Rocket Legal+, are fairly pricey, and you may end up paying for a number of extras that you don’t require. This is especially true of the Legal+ tier, which is only available as an annual membership that you pay for entirely upfront. If you are willing to pay up, the sheer volume of services and extras, even beyond the legal offerings, mean that nearly any of your business’ filing needs will be serviced at the Legal+ tier. Rocket Lawyer provides a huge variety of services at a remarkable level of depth for anyone looking to start or manage an LLC or corporation. This extends beyond the headlining legal services to comprehensive document support (including its RocketSign service for signing docs online), tax filing and registering trademarks. Value  Rocket Lawyer’s pricing structure is slightly unusual in that it varies between the two tiers of its primary subscription offerings, dubbed Rocket Legal and Rocket Legal+. Rocket Legal is available for a monthly rate, while Rocket Legal+ is only available as an annual subscription. While both tiers provide a wide array of services, document support and lots of extra features for budding businesses, you may end up paying for stuff that you don’t end up using, which is especially true with the year-long commitment required at the Legal+ tier. However, if you do require many or most of what’s included, and will actually utilize the services, you’re definitely getting your money’s worth with either subscription. Functionality  As mentioned above, the major standouts in terms of features offered by Rocket Lawyer are its legal services. The document library and customization/revision services can help you build bespoke legal documents for hundreds of purposes — vital for any business that requires a lot of contracts with third parties, temporary employees or that manages a large number of partnerships. This includes everything from real estate filings like lease documents to personal documents such as wills, but the focus is on the types of business docs that many LLCs will find valuable, including NDAs and operating agreements. In the same vein, Rocket Lawyer’s ability to connect you to a lawyer to get quick answers to legal queries can be a boon to any small business owner who may not be familiar with all of the complexities and legalities of establishing and running an LLC. Support  Rocket Lawyer offers a number of ways to get in touch with its customer service specialists. You can chat with a representative online through the live chat function on its official website, reach out by email or call the company directly any time between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. PT. Rocket Lawyer also provides guides and FAQs on its site to answer common questions and guide business owners through some of the universal challenges of owning a business. There’s a section of legal resources, as well as articles on topic categories ranging from employment and HR to intellectual property and business operations.

The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. With a heavy focus on guided services, we think Northwest Registered Agent is well-suited to first-time business owners or novices. Beyond providing a registered agent (a company or individual who receives tax or legal documents for your business and, typically, assists you in processing them) for your business, Northwest Registered Agent offers a range of tools and resources to get your LLC off the ground. Corporate Guides are on hand to answer your business questions and help you navigate the most convoluted and challenging facets of founding and running an LLC. The company provides a lot of the infrastructure for managing your company as well, like a website and phone line, so it’s a good fit for customers looking for a one-stop solution for getting an LLC off the ground. Despite the focus on registered agents in its name, Northwest Registered Agent has most (if not all) of the tools you’ll need to launch your LLC and keep it running. It also places a premium on privacy, allowing you to use one of its offices as a mailing address to protect your (and your employees’) data, and will handle many of the most challenging aspects of creating a business so you can focus on the bottom line. Value  The value Northwest Registered Agent delivers for your money will depend largely on what services your company needs and how many optional extras you decide to add to your cart. While its core services are relatively inexpensive when compared to competing companies, add-ons (things like annual reporting, mail forwarding or trademark services) all cost extra and can add up quickly. On the upside, however, the à la carte business model means that you’ll only pay for the services you want, and won’t get a lot of features you don’t need bundled into a plan with accompanying price bloat. Functionality  Northwest Registered Agent offers a solid variety of other features in addition to the registered agents in its name. Most importantly for those looking to launch a new LLC, it has everything you need to start an LLC and get it registered in your state. Northwest Registered Agent has offices in all 50 states, as well as D.C. and Puerto Rico. The company also offers annual reporting options to ensure your LLC stays compliant, foreign qualification services for when you’re ready to expand and website creation and hosting tools so that your LLC has an online presence from day one. For a new business, all the fundamentals will be met. Support  Support is one of Northwest Registered Agent’s strongest pillars. It starts with the company’s Corporate Guides — business experts available by phone or email to answer your questions as they arise and provide you with advice. It has hundreds of guides on its payroll, and they include paralegals, lawyers, entrepreneurs and people from a variety of other backgrounds, ensuring there’s a high chance someone at the company will be able to address your specific circumstances. There’s also a large database of information, educational resources and blog posts on common business questions and issues on the Northwest website to help customers deep dive into research even when live support isn’t available. You can also contact Northwest support by phone, through an email form on its site or at its physical address in Spokane, Washington. Learn more: Read our full Northwest Registered Agent review. Our editorial team created our expert opinion scores. The expert score contributes to 10% of the data-focused methodology, which underpins our Blueprint rating for each company. The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. LegalZoom is an appropriate fit for two types of business owners: those who are comfortable doing a fair amount of the work of getting their LLC registered themselves and want to save money they’d otherwise spend getting professionals to help out, or those who want a comprehensive assistance package to get their LLC up and running with minimal effort (and are willing to pay for that luxury). At the low end of the price spectrum, LegalZoom offers an affordable package with limited tools and features; on the high end, it has a premium package stacked with features including legal consultations and hands-on guidance. LegalZoom offers its premium subscribers high-level support, both in the early stages when you’re first launching your LLC and later when you’re in the management stage. This includes guidance and unlimited consultations with business attorneys, as well as email, chat and phone support along with legal review of all your documents and contracts. Value  At the low end, it’s hard to argue with the value of LegalZoom’s introductory LLC package, which is free (other than state filing fees). Unfortunately, this option is pretty bare bones, and if you are looking for compliance essentials and other extras, you’ll have to look into a higher tier. The Premium package, while fairly expensive, includes a lot of features — and some white glove services — that go a long way toward justifying that price tag. The middle-tier Pro package is the weakest of the company’s offerings, being nearly as costly as the Premium tier but lacking a lot of the features that make the Premium offering so appealing, like all the hands-on legal guidance. Functionality Founding an LLC can be a daunting and complicated legal proposition, which is where a lot of the aforementioned premium features come in handy. With its Premium package, LegalZoom includes unlimited 30-minute consultations with business attorneys about the myriad legal issues that can materialize when first launching an LLC, as well as more in-depth, hands-on guidance from an attorney that you get to select based on factors like experience level and location. LegalZoom also includes consultations with insurance and small-business experts at its two higher-priced tiers, to help you with all the thorny, non-legal issues that business owners face. We like that all tiers, including the Basic plan, include a Wix website and access to a library of more than 150 downloadable legal forms. Support  All of the consultation and guidance features (legal, insurance and small business advice) we’ve lauded in the previous sections are important pillars of LegalZoom’s support structure, though it’s important to note that the vast majority of them are only available to Pro and Premium customers. Free customers are mostly limited to a digital welcome packet and email and chat support, while Premium and Pro customers also get access to phone support. LegalZoom also hosts an article center on its website that includes guides covering topics ranging from business formation, legal issues and estate planning to intellectual property and financial advice.

The expert score contributes to 10% of the data-focused methodology, which underpins our Blueprint rating for each company. The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. Strong pricing transparency is something we’re always on the lookout for, and Bizee hits the nail on the head. It is clear about all its costs, including its à la carte extras that you have to pay extra for at the lower tiers. All costs are a one-time fee, with no recurring costs or monthly/annual subscriptions to contend with. Bizee is a good fit for a wide variety of entrepreneurs looking to launch an LLC, because its three primary packages support a broad range of potential customers. The Silver package is reasonably outfitted for a standard free-plus-state-filing-fees offering and is suitable for business owners who want to get their LLC started but have a more limited budget to play with. The mid-tier Gold package is a good compromise, with many of the premium features of the Platinum tier. Bizee offers all of the key features you’d expect from one of the best LLC service companies as well as some extras that are fairly unusual in the space (like lifetime compliance alerts and a banking resolution document) and divides them equitably across its three package options. Value All three of Bizee’s packages represent a solid value with the number of features and perks increasing in proportion to increasing cost. At the basic level, the Silver tier, you get everything you need to create a new LLC from the ground up, plus a business banking account and unlimited phone and email support (all for no charge other than your state’s filing fees). The next step up, the Gold tier, adds features like a tax ID (EIN) number and an operating agreement for a one-time fee of $199 plus filing fees. For $100 more than the Gold package at $299 plus state fees, Platinum includes expedited filing to get your business off the ground as quickly as possible, including business contract templates and a web domain and business email address. Functionality  Bizee includes the basic and most important features you’d expect from an LLC service in all of its packages, including filing the articles you need to launch and setting you up with free registered agent service for a year. Beyond that, there are a number of welcome perks designed to keep your business running smoothly in the months and years after launch. Bizee offers a web domain and business email with its Platinum tier — or for an upcharge at Silver and Gold — so your online communications look professional and contain your business’ name. These features also give you an online presence to help promote and market your LLC. Expedited filing is a huge boon if you need to get up and running quickly, and specialty options — like help filing IRS form 2553 — can allow your company to be taxed as an S-Corp, which can save you significant money at tax time. Support  Bizee doesn’t offer a tremendous amount of support in the business or legal sense, either with its packages directly or as add-ons, though it does offer a free tax consultation to clients as well as services to help you stay on top of your accounting and bookkeeping (for a monthly fee). The company also hosts a pretty extensive resource center on its official site where you can investigate topics like state filing fees or learn more about LLCs and what the process is like for creating one. Bizee also offers customer support Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST by phone, as well as through a support request form on its site. Learn more: Read our full Bizee review.

The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. Swyft Filings is a good choice for new business owners who don’t want to deal with some of the complications of creating an LLC, like filing for an employer identification number (EIN) , creating an operating agreement to shield individual owners from liability for the actions of the business or buying a domain name for your website through another company (each Swyft Filings plan comes with a free domain name, even the $0 Basic plan). It may not be a good fit for an entrepreneur who will require a lot of specific legal advice, a highly guided founding experience or complex legal documents as a part of operating their business, but for the average SMB, it’s a strong option. Swyft Filings offers everything you need to get your LLC in place quickly, especially if you’re willing to pay for the highest-priced plan, which includes same-day filing. It offers all the bedrock services you need and some extras at reasonable prices given what’s on offer. Value How much value you derive from Swyft Filing’s plans will depend on what your needs as a customer and small business owner are. If you don’t need an index of complex legal documents and aren’t looking for a hands-on, highly guided experience as you set up your LLC, Swyft likely has a package that will offer great value for the money. The basic package includes some extras that a lot of basic plans at other leading LLC service companies don’t, like a free domain name and hour-long business tax consultation. The features available on the other plans escalate appropriately with the price. Some standouts being same-day filing at the Premium ($299 plus state filing fees) level, and an operating agreement, banking resolution and organizational minutes at both the Premium and Standard tiers. Functionality While Swyft Filings doesn’t offer a lot of features that radically stand out from similar companies, it does offer the full range of foundational services you’d expect (and need) as a prospective LLC founder. A few things that do leap off the spec sheet at Swyft are the free domain name included with all of its packages (especially impressive with the free, Basic package), and the same-day filing included in its Premium offering. A domain name typically costs a fair amount of money at most web hosting companies, and it’s a nice-to-get here for owners who want to create a unique website to showcase their business. There’s also a handy Digital LLC Kit that comes with the Premium package, which bundles together a custom digital seal for your company, some customized stock certificates you can distribute as formal ownership docs to your co-founders or shareholders and an ownership ledger to mark any ownership transitions across the lifetime of your business for both legal and historical purposes. Support  Swyft Filings offers lifetime phone and email customer service with all of its packages, including the free Basic package. Customer support is available Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. CST. Swyft also hosts a large Learning Center on its website. Here you can find resources to guide you through common tasks necessary to start an LLC, like how to get a registered agent or how to get an EIN to open a business bank account. You can also read the results of research studies Swyft has funded on topics like cities where future business ventures are most likely to thrive or states with the most jobs created by new businesses.

The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. MyCorporation offers reasonably affordable plans with a small set of included core features and a number of additional features available as paid add-ons. The set of core features expands as you move up through the four tiers of MyCorporation’s plans, but overall, they don’t compare favorably to a number of the competitors on this list, many of which offer more included services and perks with their plans. However, if you do want a lot of specific, à la carte features and know which of them will benefit you most, especially if you plan to grow your business extensively beyond founding, MyCorporation may be a good fit for you. It’s possible to configure one of the company’s plans (by matching the right base plan with the appropriate paid extras) so that it’s perfectly tailored to your needs if you fit in a specific spectrum of businesses, but bear in mind it will take some additional legwork to determine if that’s the case. Though it can get fairly costly, MyCorporation offers a broad range of customization by allowing customers to combine its four core plans with a range of additional paid extras. The extras range from practical perks that many small businesses could find useful, like expedited filing, to vanity add-ons that will appeal to a much smaller (and likely, a higher-budget) niche. Value  Though MyCorporation offers four packages to get started founding your LLC, it lacks the free option that many of its competitors offer. While its basic package is relatively low priced, it also doesn’t include a lot of functionality that’s not in competitors’ free, basic packages. Discovering the real value in MyCorporation’s offerings takes a bit of digging, and requires you to have a very firm grasp up front of what your company needs at founding and what services will be useful to you down the line. You’ll need to really know what documents and filings you’ll need to stay compliant, for instance, to ascertain whether it’s worth adding on extras like the business license compliance package MaintainMyBiz — the cost of which can add up quickly. Functionality MyCorporation does offer a reasonable range of features, though many of them are only available as paid add-ons. The core plans, particularly the Basic and Standard packages, only include the minimum to get your business off the ground, and MyCorporation as a whole doesn’t offer much by way of white-glove or guided services, nor does it offer consultations with business or legal experts. However, there are a lot of useful features tucked into the upper-tier plans that will serve a broader spectrum of LLCs, and several in the optional add-ons as well. For example, registered agent services are included with the Deluxe and Premium packages but costs an additional $120 a year at the two lower tiers. Similarly, an Employer Tax ID or EIN, necessary if you don’t want to use your personal social security number on business and tax forms, is only available as a $79 add-on (though it should always be noted that you can file for an EIN yourself for free with the IRS). Support  As we mention above, MyCorporation doesn’t offer much in the way of hands-on guidance during the founding process, but it does offer a huge database of educational resources, blog posts and FAQs in its online learning center which can replace a lot of that guidance if you’re willing to do your homework. The learning center goes in-depth defining common business terms and walking you through some of the bureaucracy you’ll need to navigate to get your LLC registered and running smoothly. You can also reach out to MyCorporation support directly by phone between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. PT, or contact through a form on its site and request information by email or phone. The site even includes contact information if you want to reach out by snail mail or fax. Learn more: Read our full MyCorporation review. Our editorial team created our expert opinion scores.

The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. Inc Authority provides a number of services for free that other companies hide behind an upcharge, some of which (like registered agent service) can be a real boost for successfully creating an LLC. If you’re looking for an inexpensive way to launch your LLC, and only require the basics required to get started, Inc Authority is a great option. This isn’t to imply that Inc Authority includes everything – a number of extras and add-ons do require additional fees. However, the free plan is generous enough that none of those additional services will be required to get your LLC registered. Inc Authority also provides healthy support and guidance, making it an ideal fit for newcomers working with a limited budget. Not only are many of Inc Authority’s LLC services free, but it also  provides funding advice for your company to seek additional capital to fuel the early stages of founding and development. The main appeal of Inc Authority’s business model is how many of their services are provided free of charge, and that nothing that’s absolutely necessary to creating an LLC is hidden behind a paywall. We also appreciate the robust support options that Inc Authority offers to help get your LLC off the ground as painlessly as possible Value  While the value of Inc Authority’s add-ons (which include a wide gamut of extras like tax preparation — both business and personal — help securing a federal trademark, business funding or a private consultation with a website designer) is a bit iffy, its free services provide remarkable value compared to many of its competitors. Its free offerings set you up with everything you need to get your LLC off the ground, including things like express processing that nearly all of its competitors charge more for (or only include in higher tier packages). Functionality  While the pricing structure for its add-ons is obscured on Inc Authority’s official website, the company is transparent about offering a lot of upfront freebies in the hopes that the company will secure your long-term loyalty and you’ll come back to avail yourself of its paid services. That said, the enticing freebies could very well be everything you need. There’s preparation and filing of all required documents, registered agent service, express processing to get your LLC registered fast, a free tax planning consultation, free business credit and funding analysis to make sure your company is on stable financial footing ahead of launch and lots of other helpful features that will appeal to small to medium-sized business owners — particularly to first-timers. Support  As we’ve mentioned, Inc Authority provides a lot of gratis support with its free LLC service. There’s funding support, a free tax planning consult and the company’s Inc Care support, which promises expert support to answer any of your questions by phone or email. Paid support includes even more help, like access to a business plan consultant to advise on the creation of an efficient and effective plan for your business’ operation and growth, or a consultation with a website designer to help you create an ideal online presence for your LLC. Availability of these additional options looks more attractive considering that you don’t need to shell out for so many of the core services. You can reach Inc Authority’s U.S.-based customer support by phone, chat or email between the hours of 6 a.m. and 5 p.m. PT. Learn more: Read our full Inc Authority review.

The expert score combines first-person experience, subject matter expertise and extensive research to develop these metrics as another source of truth for readers during their decision-making process. Active Filings is another LLC service company that offers the essentials, though unlike Inc Authority, it doesn’t offer much by way of additional services. In fact, at least in terms of their LLC-specific services, there’s very little available outside of the core features it serves in its three primary plans. This includes guided or white-glove consultation services, so Active Filings is really best suited to entrepreneurs who have a reasonably solid grasp of what they need to launch their LLC and are comfortable with handling a lot of the post-launch tasks and details. However, if you are just looking for a fairly bare-bones experience, Active Filings packages are very reasonably priced and do provide all the essentials you need to get your LLC registered and operating. Both of its paid packages also include expedited, one-day processing, so if speed is a priority, Active Filings is a good option. Active Filings provides all the prerequisites for creating a new LLC, with very few frills and extras. On the one hand, if you do want an array of add-ons and guidance, this is a clear mark in the con column; on the pro side, however, Active Filings’ packages are priced in a way that reflects the minimal extras, and you’re unlikely to pay for feature bloat that you don’t need. Value  The free package is a solid value in the sense that it provides the bare necessities to get started, but there are free options at other companies that are much more fully featured, particularly at Inc Authority. The paid plans, on the other hand, are very affordable and include a well-rounded and more complete suite of options. The best value here is the middle tier, which Active Filings calls The Sprinter. You get all the basics from the basic package and the most valuable add-ons from the top tier but for $150 less. Functionality  The core features of Active Filings’ three plans start with everything you’d need to launch an LLC. There’s the basic filing service where Active Filings will file your Articles of Organization, registered agent service and annual report compliance, meaning the company will file your necessary annual report and notify you ahead of time when important filing dates are approaching. That is the beginning and end of what you get with Active Filing’s free service, meaning it’s likely not a great fit for most, considering how much more you can get through other companies’ free packages. However, a paid plan could be worthwhile. Active Filings adds expedited filing at the aptly named Sprinter tier — their middle package — as well as EIN service, privacy protection and a business address all at a very reasonable price. This is pretty clearly the best choice of the three options. You can also move up to the final Finisher tier, which also gets you a corporate seal and corporate book (a leather three-ring binder), though it doesn’t justify the $150 increase in price. Support  Active Filings lacks a live chat option, though it does offer phone support between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET, as well as email support through a form on its website. There’s also a mailing address listed on its site if you prefer to communicate by post. Active Filings also hosts a great database of information on its site that helpfully includes tons of information broken out by state. This is practically a necessity for a company that offers so little guidance otherwise, but it’s an excellent resource even if you don’t end up doing business with the company but still have questions about how to get started launching an LLC in your state.

ZenBusiness is another LLC service company that seems configured to entice customers to buy add-ons and extras outside of its core packages. While the core packages technically include most of what you need to create an LLC, they’re fairly devoid of extras, and some necessities are missing (like registered agent service, which is a $199 per year add-on). Its lowest and middle-tier options aren’t likely a great fit for most given how much more value you can get from similar or lower-priced offerings at other companies, but its highest tier, the Premium plan, does offer reasonable value for what you get. This is largely because it includes a website builder, a domain for your website and business email, which can be costly if purchased independently from a web hosting company. This means it’s a good fit for customers who are willing to pay for some other extras and for the privilege of having an all-in-one solution for the vast majority of their business needs. ZenBusiness’ biggest appeal is that it can serve as a complete, one-stop-shop for nearly all of your business needs, from incorporation to the early stages and on into growth and long-term management. There are solutions for creating an LLC, branding, marketing and creating an online presence for your business, as well as financial and business planning tools. Value It’s hard to argue that a free plan isn’t a good value, but when you consider how much more is on offer from some of ZenBusiness’ competitors, the Starter package isn’t particularly appealing. It includes standard application filing and virtually nothing else. The Pro plan isn’t a tremendous improvement. It adds some crucial tools like compliance filing, expedited filing and an operating agreement, but it’s fairly pricey and still lacks the registered agent service and the website features you can only get with the highest-priced plan. That plan is called Premium, and, though it’s the priciest, it’s also where the real value of ZenBusiness’ offerings lies. When you consider that you get the website builder, domain and business email and also account for how much those would cost you if you bought them elsewhere, the price tag looks fairly reasonable. Functionality ZenBusiness’ core packages don’t offer a tremendous amount of functionality on their own, particularly if you take out the online tools only available at the Premium tier. A lot of features are add-ons that you have to pay for independently, like registered agent service at $199 per year, logo creation for $60 or tax services starting at $49 per month. While a lot of these are very handy, you can see how they can quickly add up to a big price tag. However, if you’ve got the budget, ZenBusiness does let you handle a huge amount of your business management with a single company which could ultimately save you a lot of time.

FIlenow offers a basic suite of tools to launch your LLC at a reasonable price. It finds a sweet spot with its Premium plan, which compares favorably with similar plans at other LLC services when you consider its relatively low price and the features on offer. However, Filenow is another company that doesn’t offer much beyond the basics, so if your company needs significant legal help, business planning assistance or other advanced services, Filenow is likely not a good match. That said, Filenow also provides the necessary tools to get started and won’t overcharge you for extras you don’t need. Its pricing structure is clearly laid out, and the company is transparent about precisely how much it charges for each service, package or feature. The Premium plan, specifically, will prove a good fit for proprietors looking to launch a relatively simple LLC or those who are comfortable handling a lot of the peripheral management tasks related to running a business themselves. Filenow stands out due to its transparent pricing structure and its promise to fully refund its service fee if your LLC application is rejected by the state for any reason pertaining to Filenow’s processing, including errors, negligence or issues with any document the company filed. Value The Starter package Filenow offers doesn’t provide much in the way of value when you consider that you can get most if not all that it offers from other companies for free (unfortunately, Filenow doesn’t offer a free plan). The Premium plan is a better choice, as on top of the basics provided in the Starter plan, it also includes a year of registered agent service, expedited processing and a number of other services that will be particularly valuable during the founding process and in the first year operating your LLC. Functionality The Starter package that Filenow offers for $49 plus state filing fees is quite bare bones. It includes the standard filing service, unlimited name search to ensure your business name is unique and some of the other essential tools you’ll need to get your LLC off the ground, but it lacks registered agent service and virtually any additional perks or extras. The Premium package rounds out this offering by including a year of registered agent service, an EIN and an operating agreement, which is an essential legal document that largely defines the structure of your company. A lot of the appeal of the Premium package comes from this extra functionality, essentially asking you to pay to save yourself the time and effort of researching how to create and file legal and business documents. Support Filenow lists a physical address in New York on its website where you can reach the company by post, as well as phone and email contact information. You can reach customer service by phone any time between the hours of 9 a.m. and 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. Filenow offers limited other support options, and there are very limited support resources on its site beyond a blog with a handful of educational posts and a FAQ with a few basic definitions of business terms.

Expert score (10%): We thoroughly research each company to determine what features and services a company offers versus each plan’s price to determine whether they represent solid value for small business owners.

Value (19%): We consider a company’s value with small businesses in mind. Key factors include whether a company offers a free plan or trial, and what’s included with it, what features are available at which plan level and how those plans are priced compared to competitors, as well as how upfront and transparent each company is with its pricing structure. Features (49%): We carefully consider what features are included in a company’s core plans, which features are only available as add-ons, and how comprehensive the overall feature set is, all through the lens of those features’ usefulness to small and medium-sized business owners.

An LLC service provider helps business owners form limited liability companies. To do so, they collect the information required to file the articles of organization with the secretary of state. They also fill out the forms, send them to the proper address, track the status and inform customers when the LLC is formed. An LLC service primarily helps individuals to establish new LLCs. Typically, one of these services will: In addition to helping LLCs get established, service providers often offer a variety of packages with multiple other services and other ancillary services such as access to registered agents, help with legal documents and contracts, and establishing EINs.  My experience “LLC formation and management is something you can do on your own. However, it’s tedious and comes with risks. I once missed a filing deadline and quickly owed double the original amount due. That extra fee alone would’ve paid for a registered agent service a few times over. Being that LLC services are often affordable, if not free, I’ve found that handing the responsibility off to experts makes sense. But do shop around and be mindful of add-ons you may not need.” As the name implies, one of the primary advantages of creating a limited liability company is how the structure shields most of its members’ personal assets; only resources directly invested in the company are vulnerable in most cases. There are also a number of advantages that an LLC provides, including: Expert insight “An LLC provides important protections for the owners of unincorporated businesses like partnerships and sole proprietorships. Without one, you could be held personally responsible for the debts and liabilities of your business.  For example, if your business is sued or goes under with outstanding debt, your personal assets (e.g., your bank account, home, vehicles, etc.) could be at risk. It’s not fun to consider worst-case scenarios, but you’ll be glad you did if they ever occur.  However, setting up an LLC alone isn’t enough. You’ll also need to ensure you’re educated on the laws related to limiting personal liability, such as keeping your personal and business finances separate.” While it’s entirely possible to create an LLC without any external assistance, an LLC service can be a tremendous help, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the process of creating an LLC or need specific help.  There are a lot of documents involved in creating an LLC, a number of required filings and various other technical and legal requirements to navigate that can be difficult to manage to newcomers or anyone not intimately familiar with founding a business. The best LLC services will additionally provide advice, guidance and services designed to ensure your LLC operates smoothly and you have the tools on hand to efficiently manage after launch, as well. Which LLC service will be best for you will come down to the type of business you’re founding and how much assistance you’ll require throughout the process. However, anyone looking to create an LLC should seek a service that will at bare minimum cover all of the legal necessities and filings required to launch an LLC — things like filing your application with the secretary of your state and providing registered agent service. Beyond filing your application paperwork, there are a number of key features that make the best LLC service companies stand out from mediocre providers. Expert insight “Running a business involves wearing many hats and keeping track of a wide range of deadlines. But one thing I thankfully don’t have to worry about is my annual report and other state filings. I’m happy to pay the small annual fee my registered agent service charges for the peace of mind it brings. They’ll notify you of upcoming deadlines, collect what they need from you, and take care of the rest. It’s one less thing to worry about.” Some important add-ons to look for include a company’s document library. Ideally, they’ll provide templates or help drafting the legal and business documents your LLC will need to function.  Web tools can also be a huge boon for marketing your business or selling products online, so a company that provides a free domain name, website builder, business emails or even a consultation with a web designer can be a massive value add. Some LLC service providers additionally offer useful extras like free legal and business advice, help with business funding/financing or tax planning and filing assistance.  Given some of the complexities involved with launching and running an LLC, being able to reach knowledgeable, professional customer service can be vital to operating your business (or getting it established in the first place). Consider a company’s support reputation and what channels are available to directly contact a company, as well as whether they’ll be available when you’re doing business. “LLCs come with so many benefits for business owners. Most importantly, forming one can protect your personal assets and offer tax benefits. You can DIY a business formation, but LLC services can be of great help if you want a little extra assistance and some extra tools and features. Choose a service that provides comprehensive support, from formation to ongoing compliance. This way, you can focus on growing your business while it handles the legal details. It’s peace of mind knowing your business is on solid legal ground.” *The registered agent is an annual recurring fee. In some cases, companies waive it for the first year or for another specified period of time. It’s also included in some companies’ plans. While pricing varies across the providers, the base plans typically range from $0 to $99, the mid-tier plans from $39 to $249 and the high-tier plans from $299 up to $349. Inc Authority has the best free plan offerings and is likely the best LLC service if you’re on a budget. However, most companies aren’t too far apart from each other.  To find the best deal, it’s important to look at what you get for the price. All of these plans include LLC filing but vary beyond that. The most common add-ons are registered agent services, EINs, operating agreements, bank resolutions, business bank accounts and tax consulting. The incentive on premium plans is often expedited filing to speed up the turnaround time. A few also offer customizable business contract templates, notably Rocket Lawyer, which specializes in that service.  If you opt for an LLC filing plan that doesn’t come with a lineup of services, chances are, the company is going to try to sell them to you as you check out. If you don’t need them, just click no and nothing should be added to your bill. No matter which service provider you choose, you’ll have to pay the filing fee in your state, which should be shown to you during the quoting and checkout processes.  Here are some other ongoing costs many LLCs have to pay to keep the business active and in good standing: Failing to pay any of these fees as required by your state could result in the dissolution of your LLC. In most cases, the highest-tier LLC service plans aren’t necessary to get all the services you need to start your LLC. By shopping around, you can find providers that include perks like legal document templates and expedited filing within the $100 to $200 range.  Watch out for bare minimum plans that offer lots of add-ons as your bill can add up quickly when buying services separately. Instead, look for plans that bundle services together at a great value.  Many LLC formation costs are unavoidable, such as fees to file your articles or organization and obtain a business license. However, there are several ways you can reduce your initial costs. Here are a few: Warning: Be sure to check each line item carefully at checkout, as some companies sneak in paid subscription services under the guise of free trials.  Via ZenBusiness’ website Free version available Yes Lowest published package price $199 Live chat Yes: Human Via LegalZoom’s website Free version available Yes Lowest published package price $249 Live chat Yes Via Northwest Registered Agent’s website Free version available No Lowest published package price $39 Live chat Yes A limited liability company serves as a shield for your personal assets in terms of business liabilities. Such a company ensures that if your business is found liable in a business-related lawsuit, your personal property, like your home, vehicle or personal wealth, can’t be seized. It’s important to note, however, that your liability may differ depending on your state’s laws and the specific nature of the claim. You can set up an LLC on your own by filing the required paperwork in your state and paying the required fee. Some companies, like Northwest Registered Agent, will provide you with the forms and instructions you need to do it yourself. However, that puts the responsibility on you to figure out what you need to do and ensure you do it correctly. An LLC service knows the process well and can ensure it’s done right and as quickly as possible.  Each state charges a fee to set up an LLC, so you will be required to pay that amount at the very least. Beyond that, you can get an LLC formed without any additional fees if you file the paperwork yourself or opt for an LLC service provider that offers a free basic plan.  If you need help covering the costs to start an LLC, there are a few places you could turn. You could borrow using a loan or credit card, look at peer-to-peer lending, ask a friend or family member or bring on an LLC partner that can help on the funding front.  LLCs can provide tax flexibility to their owners because you can choose whether you’ll be taxed as a sole proprietor, partnership, C-corporation or S-corporation. While an LLC is a business structure, its sole purpose is to limit the liability of its owners. It doesn’t come with its own tax rules. The best place to start your LLC is typically in your home state where you’ll be conducting business. If you file in another state, you’ll have to also register in your home state as a foreign LLC which can mean double the paperwork and fees. However, there are a few states businesses tend to flock to thanks to their business-friendly laws. Delaware is popular because it doesn’t impose income tax on corporations that are registered in the state but not doing business in the state. Shareholders who don’t reside in the state also don’t need to pay tax on shares in the state. Further, Delaware has a Court of Chancery in which judges who are experts in corporate law handle corporation cases. Wyoming is another popular LLC-filing state because it’s affordable and has business-friendly tax laws. The initial filing fee is $100 and the annual report cost is $60. Further, no corporate or personal income taxes are charged, and the state has strong asset protection laws. An LLC is a type of business structure that separates owners from their businesses to shield them from business liabilities. It can be established to protect sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations. A corporation is a type of business structure that establishes a business as a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its owners. Corporations can elect to be C-corps or S-corps which are treated differently under tax law. While both can offer business owners protection against business liabilities, LLCs can be established to protect several business types while a corporation is a business type that offers protection in and of itself. Generally yes. The IRS requires single-member LLCs to have EINs when they have employees or are required to file certain excise tax forms. On the other hand, multimember LLCs must have EINs and use them to file taxes. Even when an EIN is not required, it can be helpful. Many banks will ask for one if you want a bank account, credit card or loan for your business. It can also provide a layer of privacy, enabling sole proprietors to use it instead of their social security numbers. LLC filing companies often offer registered agent services. In some cases, the service is included in a company’s LLC filing plan, while in others it comes with an additional cost. Further, some providers include it for the first year and then charge an annual fee in the years following.
