The crawler crane is capable of operating for eight hours unplugged or for extended periods when connected to a power source. Sims Crane and Equipment, a private crane rental and rigging service company in Florida, has showcased its battery-powered crawler crane at their corporate headquarters in Tampa. Sims Crane hosted the crawler crane’s U.S. debut event in conjunction with the crawler crane’s designer, multi-national equipment manufacturer Liebherr. The two companies held a joint presentation, explaining the history of both companies and the features of the newly manufactured LR 1250.1 Unplugged electric crane. “We are honored to partner with Liebherr and be on the forefront to serve a vastly growing need for alternative energy,” said Jackson Sims, vice president of Sims Crane and Equipment. The crawler crane’s battery-powered engine cuts local carbon emissions and is capable of operating for eight hours unplugged or for extended periods when connected to a power source. According to Liebherr and Sims, performance is similar between the electric version of the crawler crane and its diesel-powered counterpart. The crawler crane is also quieter than its diesel counterpart for construction jobs in residential areas, at hospitals and in other locations where noise pollution may be a concern. The battery-powered crawler crane is part of Sims’ rental fleet.
