 The decision to rebuild is one you should take with caution. After you have read our article here and still want to rebuild, there are good rules to follow to make your team. If you set the course to retool your team, your goal should be to compete for a playoff spot in the upcoming season. There is so much uncertainty from year to year, let alone predicting multiple years out, there is little value in planning multiple years of a rebuild. If you retool your roster, focus on contending in the upcoming season. Do not count your team out even if you do not think you can become an elite team. Jalen Hurts, Cooper Kupp, and Derrick Henry, all elite players who pushed their team toward byes, did not play in the championship week of the 2022 fantasy playoffs. On the other hand, “disappointing players” like George Kittle and Mike Evans had game-winning performances in the playoffs, giving teams that got into the playoffs a good chance of winning the championship. Elite NFL players tend to produce for a long time, yet dynasty players tend to look for the next best thing instead of the proven commodity. The result is older players, who have elite profiles, are undervalued. If you plan to contend the next season, these players can be acquired for a discount and jumpstart your contention next season. If you have these players, be careful about selling them. If they are available on the trade market, consider adding them. Current wide receiver examples include Mike Evans, Keenan Allen, and DeAndre Hopkins. These profiles can often outproduce their fantasy cost and can elevate your team at a low cost without harming your ability to build for the future. To remake your roster look, focus on maintaining and acquiring premium players and positions. For cheaper stashes, look for high-efficiency players among low-sample size players at premium positions. Additionally, focus on potential starting options at quarterback in Superflex or 2QB leagues. At the end of 2021, stashing quarterbacks like Marcus Mariota and Geno Smith could be done cheaply and provided value the following season. A volume approach to back-of-roster stashes in tight-end premium leagues can provide value in your trades or lineups the following season.
