Governments are incapable of fixing the insecurity of the internet by themselves, and businesses are unlikely to do it until the economic pain of ignoring the insecurity of the internet becomes greater than the profits it can earn from it. There are no silver bullets beyond restructuring the internet to rely more on new secure private networks, particularly for the operation of critical infrastructure. That will require businesses, governments, and users in democratic nations to act together to transform the internet into networks that rely on the authentication of people rather than IP addresses, mandate strict rules of online behavior, and maintain cyber police (human or machine) to enforce them. Government officials in the U.S. and the UK recently took victory laps after reporting a 15% reduction in ransomware attacks. Ironically, as both governments issued press releases and touted their accomplishments, a global ransomware blitz by a presumed group of Russian and Chinese hackers was underway. The attacks infected an estimated 5,000 victims in Europe and the U.S. with ransomware, demonstrating the two-steps-forward, one-step-back nature of fighting the war on cyber terror.
