The news comes days after the national pharmacy retailer announced it was shuttering its 440,000-square-foot distribution center half a mile away on the same road. "All prescriptions will be transferred to the nearby CVS Pharmacy at 2301 John Hawkins Parkway in Hoover to ensure that patients continue to have uninterrupted access to pharmacy care," CVS Health spokesperson Mary Gattuso said. Gattuso went on to say all store employees would be offered comparable roles with the company. The distribution center employs more than 200 workers, according to Bessemer Mayor Kenneth Gulley. He hopes that the city's other distribution centers will help soften the unemployment blow. "We worked over the years to try to do is to make sure and so that we have other companies and stuff that can absorb the 200 plus or so workers," Gulley said. The facility will cease operations in the middle of April and close a month later.  Gulley believes they should be able to find another company to keep the shipping campus from being empty for too long.  "We still in so having companies look at moving in up to Bessemer in the western side of Jefferson County. So we're optimistic that we're going to be able to fill that facility as well," Gulley said. Bessemer's unemployment rate is currently under 3.5% and Gulley says they've added 10,000 new jobs over the last ten years.
