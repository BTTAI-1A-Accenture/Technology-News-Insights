Austin Steele of Super Groupie says Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo would invite the 16-year-old singer/guitarist and his band over to record at his home studio. “I knew his daughter Cailin through [Rancho Peñasquitos] high school. She brought him our CD. He became a mentor to us. He was our early producer.” Cailin, who has appeared in Justin Bieber music videos, added vocals to Super Groupie’s “Say You Want Me,” a song that got 41,000 YouTube visits. Super Groupie's debut album Sky.Sand.Sol. was released in summer 2014 on local label Pacific Records, and their song “Lightning” appeared on the soundtrack of MTV’s Washington Heights in 2013. After shooting a popular video with model Cailin Russo, Steele moved on to launch a new band called Creature Canyon. No shows scheduled
