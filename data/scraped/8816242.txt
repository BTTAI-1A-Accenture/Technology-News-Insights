Build, battle, defend. Anime World Tower Defense is a Roblox game that fans of All Star Tower Defense should enjoy. Both experiences are tower defence games where you recruit iconic anime characters to help defend your territory from wave after wave of enemies. AWTD has a roster of over 100 characters that are based on iconic shows like One Piece, Dragon Ball Z and Bleach. To get new characters you'll have to pull for them using the game's gacha-style system, which offers random characters when you exchange Puzzle Pieces. If you're running low on this in-game currency you can always redeem a couple of Anime World Tower Defense codes to top up your account and get free Puzzle Pieces. Not sure how to redeem codes in Anime World Tower Defense? Here's a step-by-step guide: If you entered in an active code the text in the textbox will change to 'Redeemed Code!' A notification will also appear above the Settings menu letting you know what goodies you've claimed for free. If you get an 'Invalid Code' error message instead then that means the code is no longer working.
