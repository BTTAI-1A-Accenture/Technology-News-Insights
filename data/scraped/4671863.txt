Coming through the Spanish side's academy as a youngster, the 21-year-old has returned to his former club from Tottenham with limited opportunities coming his way in north London. Initially struggling for minutes following his move to Tottenham in July 2021, Gil first departed Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last January to join Valencia on a deal until the end of the campaign. After helping Lo Che to the final of the Copa del Rey, the talented winger was expected to return to the Mestalla Stadium in the summer but another move didn't come to fruition, with Tottenham unable to bring in a replacement on deadline day. With game time extremely limited under Antonio Conte in the first few months of this term, Gil did catch the eye when handed starts in the wins over Crystal Palace and Portsmouth at the beginning of the year. It did appear that he would be remaining in N17 beyond the January transfer window following those performances, but Arnaut Danjuma's arrival from Villarreal on loan has seen him drop a further place down the pecking order.
