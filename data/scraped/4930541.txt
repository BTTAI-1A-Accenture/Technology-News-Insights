Actor Troy Kotsur, who appeared in last year’s Academy Award-winning Best Picture, Coda, which won him the award for Best Actor, has signed on for a guest role in the upcoming twelfth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm at HBO. According to an individual with knowledge of the series, Kotsur will appear as himself in one episode as a member of Larry David’s golf club. Curb Your Enthusiasm was renewed for Season 12 back in August 2022. Seinfeld creator Larry David created the series and stars as a semi-fictionalized version of himself. To keep the narrative spontaneous, the series is shot without a script and cast members are given scene outlines and improvise lines as they go. Along with David, the cast also includes Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove, Cheryl Hines, Richard Lewis, Vince Vaughn, and Ted Danson, as well as a ton of guest stars over the years that have served as fun storylines throughout the series run.  I’m Jessica Fisher! I love being a wife and mom, and I love movies and TV. I’m a murderino, and love to travel and write. I love Disney and the beach, and being awesome. My favorite things to geek out on are the podcast My Favorite Murder, The Handmaid’s Tale, Mindhunter, Cobra Kai, The Wonder Years, and The Walking Dead. My favorite movies are About Time, 50/50, pretty much anything with Jason Segel and/or Paul Rudd, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Dirty Dancing, and so many others.
