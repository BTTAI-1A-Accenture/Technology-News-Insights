This AFL match for round 20 will take place at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and feature a matchup between the Collingwood Magpies and the Carlton Blues. The contest between the Collingwood Magpies and the Port Adelaide Power was a true arm wrestle, but the Magpies came out on top by defeating their rivals with a score of 85-83. On the other hand, the Carlton Blues extended their winning streak to five matches with a dominating performance against the West Coast Eagles, which resulted in a score of 140-69. Last weekend, the Collingwood Magpies played exceptionally well, as they were able to deflect all of the pressure that the Port Adelaide Power placed them under and still come out on top in a victory that was nothing short of astonishing. They played admirably on the road to earn an 83-85 score, and now the Collingwood Magpies will want to demonstrate their superiority here in order to solidify their position at the top of the standings. That victory has put them eight points clear at the top of the ladder, and it was additional evidence that the Collingwood Magpies are as good as any side in the competition, if not better. In the meantime, the victory has sent them eight points clear at the top of the ladder. As things stand, It doesn't look good for any team that has to travel to take on the Magpies, as they have won each of their most recent five games, and they have won 16 straight games at home dating all the way back to May 29, 2022. Even though they were sick earlier in the week, Isaac Quyanor, Josh Daicos, and Bobby Hill should all be ready for the Magpies. The Carlton Blues have been performing very well as of late, and they have been able to parlay their recent success into a five-game winning run, which has resulted in them moving up the ladder to ninth place with 38 points. The Blues are aware that if they have a strong weekend, they have the potential to move up as high as fifth and that their off-season prospects are still in their own hands, despite the fact that they are currently sitting just outside of the top eight. However, they will have to contend with a Collingwood Magpies club that is currently performing like a team possessed in order to win the game. If they were to win, their unbeaten run would be extended to six games, but the fact that they have three losses and a tie in their nine away games this year causes concern for the Blues. A team needs to be close to perfect in order to beat the Collingwood Magpies on their own turf. Because of a hamstring injury, Sam Walsh will not be able to play for the Blues. Jack Silvagni is also unable to play because of a knee injury; however, Patrick Cripps, Adam Cerra, Jack Martin, and Jesse Motlop should all be able to return to the lineup. The Collingwood Magpies have defeated the Carlton Blues in their last three encounters, making it three wins in a row for them. The Collingwood Magpies have nine wins in their most recent 10, while the Blues have only one win in their most recent 10. My money is on the Collingwood Magpies to come out on top, but I don't think it will be an easy victory for them because I think the Carlton Blues will give them a run for their money given how they have played recently.
