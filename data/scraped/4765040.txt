Hearing a petition filed by owners of a publishing house seeking protection, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday directed the Punjab government – through its home secretary – to ensure that a real threat assessment is carried out and adequate security is provided to the petitioners. The high court was hearing the petition filed by Harbhajan Singh, 70, and Satinder Kaur, 71, of B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh, which is a publishing house in Amritsar. Disposing of the matter on Tuesday, a bench of Justice Sudhir Mittal said, “Assuming that the petitioners were desecrating religious literature, action can only be taken in accordance with law and not through force and muscle power. Thus, the apprehension expressed by the petitioners appears to be genuine.” Justice Mittal added that the security appeared to be adequate for the moment, if it was being provided as submitted by the state counsel. “Periodical review of the threat perception be done so that public interest and the interest of the petitioners can be balanced,” the high court said. As per the petitioners, protesters from some associations have been sitting on a dharna in front of the book publishers’ shop in Amritsar. It was submitted before the high court that the firm is stated to be the oldest publishing house of Sikh religious books. According to the petitioners, in the past, there had been some attacks on the petitioners alleging disrespect to the holy scriptures.
