While investors spent much of the period bidding up businesses based on sales growth expectations, we continue to be drawn to companies that have an improved outlook through self-help measures. Spectrum Brands Holdings (SPB), a household products company, is one such example. Spectrum sells a variety of home goods through its market-leading brands including Black and Decker, Pfister and Remington. During the past 18 months, management has undertaken an initiative to exit non-core business lines such as auto care and batteries, reduce debt and improve efficiencies. The latest of these efforts came in mid -September when the company announced it was selling its home improvement segment for a sum greater than the market capitalization of the entire company. Management expects to use the proceeds to further bolster Spectrum’s balance sheet, continue to buy back shares and do tuck-in acquisitions to increase scale in its secular growth businesses, such as Pet and Home and Garden lines. Despite recent improvements in its share price, the company still trades at a meaningful discount to its peers on an enterprise value/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization basis.” Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 30 Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) produces and sells personal care and consumer tissue products across the world.

Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 768,839 shares worth about $108 million.  Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) in its Q1 2021 investor letter: “For several months now, our largest position has been Clorox – the cleaning products company. Besides wipes, the company also manufactures bleach, charcoal, cat litter, plastic bags, and container products. Clorox benefited during the Covid-19 pandemic from an increased demand for cleaning products. Companies and consumers trust the Clorox brand – a source of the company’s huge competitive advantage. United Airlines, for example, chose to partner with Clorox in its push to reassure consumers about the safety of air travel. The company is a typical “defensive” holding – subject to very small fluctuations in end market demand. Its branded consumer products remain in strong demand. Historically (pre-Covid), the company’s sales grew in line with GDP, while earnings-per-share grew slightly faster due to operational and financial leverage. We expect sales will decline slightly in the next few quarters as the Covid-19 pandemic comes to an end, but we believe this decline is more than accounted for by the company’s low valuation. On February 4th, Clorox reported results for Q4 2020, with both earnings and sales beating estimates. Sales grew by +27% (vs. 20% estimate) from the prior year’s Q4, and EPS increased +39% ($2.03 vs. $1.75 expected). The company continues to see robust demand and raised its sales and EPS guidance for the rest of the year. Shares are down 4% year-to-date. We believe the shares are undervalued at 20x trailing and 24x forward earnings and currently represent an excellent opportunity.” Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36 Church & Dwight Co., Inc.
