Pure Capital Solutionsâ€™ (OTC: PCST) wholly owned subsidiary Nova Space is proud to announce a partnership with Logical Innovations, Inc. creating a market leading team of subject matter experts to tackle the workforce challenges of the space industry. The space economy continues to grow at a historic rate, on pace to become a $1T industry by 2040. This growth requires a pipeline of human talent across all disciplines and space sectors. Current training and education models are not keeping up with the talent demand necessary to sustain the expected growth of the industry. Nova Space and Logical Innovations will focus on identifying and addressing industry skills gaps with focused training and education beyond the award-winning learning content that Nova Space has developed to date. Nova Space digital courses are designed to help current and prospective space professionals become more productive while helping provide their employers a competitive advantage in the space ecosystem. Nova Space currently supports employers in both the commercial and government space industry, within all sectors, to include launch, satellites, manufacturing, industrials, and government agencies. This partnership will leverage existing relationships with NASA, industry, and academic institutions to develop and expand space training and education solutions to fill the technician workforce talent gap, which is a recurring challenge for NASA and space companies alike. The partnership will also address the need of training solutions in pre-collegiate institutions to further invigorate STEAM skills for K-12 students, by contextualizing career opportunities in the space economy.
