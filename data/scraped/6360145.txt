The latest entertainment headlines, delivered straight to your email inbox. A new attraction opens Friday at Hershey's Chocolate World to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Hershey's Great Candy Expedition, debuting May 19, is an interactive experience that incorporates all five senses and allows guests to visit candy worlds inspired by Hershey brands. The 30-minute adventure will take visitors through three main areas, beginning at a train station inspired by trains that Milton Hershey traveled on to explore and find candy-making ingredients. Once inside the theater, visitors will be surrounded by projection-mapped screens that take them to colorful sweet stops. Scents will change throughout the candy worlds. To get from one world to the next, guests will be able to collectively control the Hersheyland Express's destinations by voting using buttons on their armrests. The journey through candy worlds – including Jolly Rancher Junction, Twizzlers Forest and Reese's Ridge – tells each candy brand's story.
