 New Delhi: Continuing with the conduct of Maritime Partnership Exercises (MPX) with Friendly Foreign Countries, INS Sahyadri exercised with Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) ship JS Suzutsuki, an Akizuki Class Destroyer in the Arabian Sea on 11 March 2023.  "Aimed at consolidating their shared commitment to regional and global security challenges, the exercise witnessed cross deck landings by integral helicopters, tactical manoeuvres and a customary steampast by the ships," read a government statement.  Indian Navy and JMSDF have been collaborating closely on various fronts and playing a key role in ensuring safety of international maritime trade and working towards global commons.  The exercise underscored the strong navy-to-navy links and the high level of interoperability between the two nations in the maritime domain.
