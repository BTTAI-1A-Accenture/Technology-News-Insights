Our full-year guidance speaks to the continued strength of our markets. Looking  beyond 2023, we believe that our strategy positions us well to support our  customers as they execute on the tailwinds we see across infrastructure,  industrial manufacturing, and energy and power. Combined, these support our  goals for profitable growth, strong cash flow, and attractive returns for our  shareholders.” Adjusted  EBITDA for the quarter increased 21.6 percent year-over-year to a  third quarter record of $1.850 billion, while adjusted EBITDA margin decreased  80 basis points to 49.1 percent. On a pro forma basis, third quarter adjusted  EBITDA margin increased 20 basis points year-over-year, including the impact of  ongoing integration costs. The decrease in the company's reported adjusted  EBITDA margin primarily reflected the impact of Ahern Rentals on gross margin  from rental revenue (excluding depreciation and stock compensation expense) and  adjusted gross margin from used equipment sales, partially offset by reduced  SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue.
