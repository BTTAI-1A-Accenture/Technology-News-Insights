 How much you pay for term life insurance depends on your age, health and the coverage amount and length of term you choose. Healthy young adults will find term life insurance coverage with low premiums. Here’s a look at monthly rates for young adults from the best life insurance companies in our analysis. Term life insurance is often the best for young adults because it’s the most affordable type of life insurance, although there’s no one type of life insurance that fits everyone’s needs—regardless of age. There are many factors that go into determining the right type of policy. For example, the insurance needs of a person with a young family and a mortgage will look different from someone who is single, rents and has an elderly relative who relies on them financially. When comparing options among the best life insurance companies, your choice will come down to two main types of life insurance: term life and permanent life. Both options can offer valuable benefits, but in different ways. Term life insurance  allows you to lock in rates for a specified term. Typically, that’s 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Young adults might also consider the 40-year term life insurance policies offered by Legal & General America (from its subsidiary Banner Life) and Protective. If you die while the coverage is in force, the insurance company pays the death benefit to your beneficiaries. If you outlive the policy, it expires (if not renewed) and no benefits are paid. The cost of term life insurance is much lower than permanent life. If you want to continue your coverage at the end of the term, you can typically renew the policy up to a certain age. But it’s generally not a great option because you should expect to pay significantly higher rates at each renewal. Term life insurance can be a great choice for young adults who are budget conscious and want to ensure they have protection in place when financial obligations are often at their highest. Permanent life insurance  can provide coverage for your entire lifetime, as long as premiums are paid. Like term insurance, a permanent life insurance policy pays out a death benefit to your beneficiaries when you die. Permanent life insurance also generally includes a cash value component that grows over time. A portion of the premiums you pay goes toward this cash value account, which you can borrow against, take a withdrawal or use it to pay premiums. There are multiple types of permanent life insurance. Permanent life insurance costs more than term life insurance. Still, it’s an option for young adults who want a cash value life insurance  policy or who have dependents who will rely on them indefinitely for financial support. Life insurance is generally worth it for anyone who has people relying on them financially. Plus, young adults are typically healthier, which means it’s easier to buy life insurance at a low rate compared to when you’re older or potentially facing health issues. Life insurance quotes  will go up every year that you wait to buy. Of course not all young adults need life insurance. A single person with no dependents and no debt that will be passed on likely does not need a policy. Life insurance is primarily about providing for others after your death. If you’re a young adult, here are common situations when you might consider making life insurance a part of your overall financial plan. Having life insurance in place is especially important if you have dependents, such as children, a spouse, or others who depend on you financially, particularly if you’re the primary earner in the household. The last thing you want is for your loved ones to be financially burdened if you pass away. The life insurance death benefit can be used for any reason, including paying bills, covering educational expenses, and paying for final expenses such as funeral and burial costs. If you pass away, not all debts die with you. A life insurance policy can provide the funds necessary to pay off these debts, ensuring your loved ones aren’t left with the financial burden. The biggest determining factors in life insurance costs are age and health. So even if you don’t have dependents now, securing life insurance while you’re young and healthy can be a good tactic. That way, if you decide to grow your family in the future, you’ll have a policy locked in at an affordable rate. Life insurance isn’t just for financially protecting family members. If you own a business, or are a key partner, life insurance can help ensure the business continues to run smoothly if you die unexpectedly. Funds can be used to cover debts, operational costs and payroll, and generally maintain business continuity.  Compare Policies With 8 Leading Insurers  The average cost of term life insurance is $31 a month for a healthy 20- or 25-year-old, according to Forbes Advisor’s research. There are many factors that affect life insurance rates, but the younger you are, the better life insurance rates you’ll get. Young adults can enjoy high coverage amounts and low premiums. Determining how much life insurance you need  comes down to estimating the financial obligations you need to cover if you died. That could mean you need a policy large enough to replace your income for a certain number of years, cover mortgage payments and more. The quickest and easiest way to determine your life insurance needs is to use a life insurance calculator.
