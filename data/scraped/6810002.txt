LOUISVILLE, Colo., Dec.  13, 2022  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JumpCloud Inc. today announced it has been named a Leader in a record number of identity, device, and directory categories by G2, the business technology industry's most trusted source for customer reviews. Based on nearly 1500 reviews and ratings from verified G2 users, JumpCloud was named a Leader in seven categories across 33 Grid® Reports, including the new category of remote support, taking the top spot in 12 Grid® Reports. "I like [that] identity, MFA, and device management [are] built in. I also love [that] I can write conditional policies to restrict some services to company-managed devices. With other solutions, you need to invest a lot of effort to properly connect different tools together. Also, it is much more affordable than buying 5 different vendors, and they keep adding new features, most of them free. My only regret is not finding them before we started our company." — Mustafa A. on G2 "User feedback and input have always been critical to JumpCloud's success, and our G2 scores reveal that our users recognize and value our commitment to them," said Cate Lochead, chief marketing officer, JumpCloud. "We released Remote Assist just a little over a month ago, and users' ratings have already put us in a Leader position for remote support — an outstanding validation of our platform. We are grateful to the IT pros who power our growth and share their feedback to make us even better; and we remain focused on continuing to expand and improve our platform for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) around the globe."
