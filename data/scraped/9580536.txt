AI, or artificial intelligence, is technology that attempts to simulate human cognitive function. AI has made its way into the software development space in a number of ways. Visit the AI article list to expand your AI knowledge. Learn More Observability is a way for development teams in an organization to view their program state. Failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures. Read about the latest observability content here Learn More In the past, the CI/CD pipeline was simply a place to integrate code. Developers would write their code in GitHub, pass it through the pipeline, and then deploy it. The pipeline has become a much more critical piece of the software delivery lifecycle today. Learn More Modern cloud-native applications, often leverage microservices, containers, APIs, infrastructure-as-code and more to enable speed in app development and deployment Learn More Sponsored By: Always On, Always Fast Deploy Distributed PostgreSQL in just 90 Seconds Learn More  The Importance of Security Testing With more development teams today using open-source and third-party components to build out their applications, the biggest area of concern for security teams has become the API. This is where vulnerabilities are likely to arise, as keeping on top of updating those interfaces has lagged. Read the Guide Here Mobile App Testing involves analyzing mobile apps for functionality, usability, visual appeal, and consistency across multiple mobile devices. It helps ensure an optimal user experience, irrespective of the device used to access the app. Learn More Today’s distributed software environments incorporate a variety of APIs with every interface your software touches, from mobile to microservices. Each API has to be continuously tested and verified to ensure your software functions as it should. Parasoft’s API testing platform makes quick, efficient, and intelligent work of such requirements. Learn More Ensure your application’s resilience, and make sure your software performs as expected under diverse operating conditions. (sponsored by Parasoft) Learn More    DevSecOps is the DevOps community’s approach to bringing security into the development lifecycle. Businesses want to deliver software, but cannot afford to release unreliable or insecure applications— therefore security needs to be baked in much sooner than it has traditionally been. Learn More Securing an application is just as important as building it in the first place. As data becomes more valuable, there are more people who want to steal it and use it for their own personal gain. Making sure applications are indeed secure has always been a challenge, as hackers try to stay one step ahead of defenders. Learn More Secrets are essential for integrating your infrastructure with databases and SaaS services. Doppler‘s developer-first security platform empowers teams to manage, orchestrate, and govern secrets across any environment. In 2023, there was an 18% decline in the number of open-source projects that are considered to be “actively maintained.” This is according to Sonatype’s Annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report. Learn More Development Managers need a different type of content than developers… They need to know what platforms, tools, trends, and issues they should be thinking about. SD Times delivers those unique topics here Learn More Agile software development has been around since the 1990s, but didn’t get the name until the famous meeting of 17 renowned software development thought leaders at Snowbird, Utah resulted in an Agile Manifesto. The idea behind Agile software development is to reduce time to market by enabling faster iterations of smaller segments of software. Learn More Value stream management involves people in the organization to examine workflows and other processes to ensure they are deriving the maximum value from their efforts while eliminating waste — of resources, time and assets. It is the practice that truly brings the business side and IT side together as partners in creating value for the organization. Learn More Learn More DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. Learn More Gravitee helps organizations manage and secure their entire API lifecycle with solutions for API design, management, security, productization, real-time observability, and more.

Learn More TigerGraph has announced the latest release of its graph analytics platform. This release offers integrations with popular databases and storage systems, Docker and Kubernetes support, availability on the AWS Marketplace and Microsoft Azure, and a new graph algorithm library. New integrations with other databases include RDBMS, Kafka, Amazon S3, and HDFS. It will also add an integration with Spark in the near future. The company has added a new TigerGraph EcoSys GitHub repository that will host new open-source connectors to TigerGraph as it rolls out. TigerGraph now supports one-click installations for major cloud marketplaces, including AWS and Microsoft Azure. This will enable customers to have better control over where their data is stored and avoid vendor lock-in, the company explained. New support for Docker and Kubernetes allows for easy portability across on-premise and cloud environments. Finally, it added a new graph algorithm library that includes GSQL implementations of popular graph analytics functions such as PageRank, Shortest Path, Connected Components, and Community Detection. “Today’s release makes it even easier for enterprises to connect TigerGraph to their existing infrastructure,” said Dr. Yu Xu, CEO and founder of TigerGraph. “It’s all part of our commitment of delivering the best graph engine on the market to power the applications that are paving the way of the future.” In addition to the platform update, the company also released a Neo4j Migration Toolkit. The toolkit will enable developers to transform Cypher queries into GSQL. “GSQL is the conceptual descendant of SQL, Cypher, Gremlin, MapReduce and SPARQL, so adding support of Cypher in GSQL was a natural step,” said Dr. Alin Deutsch, chief scientist, TigerGraph.
