Between the showmatch and the success of Disguised in the NACL split, we’ve seen community support, passionate fandom, and, simply, some really fun League of Legends matches. We’re excited for this upcoming tournament and to continue the cross over between content creators and League esports,” Zack Elliot, the director of the NACL is quoted in the announcement. At this point, only the four captains’ names are known: Aphromoo, Scarra, Sneaky, and Yassuo will pit their wits and teams against one another in a few weeks’ time in this friendly competition, with the live draft show set to take place on Sep. 3, to be broadcast on Toast’s Twitch channel. Little is known about the lineup so far, but the mastermind behind it all has dropped a hint: “the players we’ve invited I’ve personally been a fan of and have grown up watching.”
