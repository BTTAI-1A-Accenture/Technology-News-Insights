 It was recently reported that Sony has an unannounced hardware in the works that is set to release before the rumored PS5 Pro. According to a new report, the hardware in question is a PlayStation cloud gaming handheld. The original report came from known insider Tom Henderson, who casually mentioned the unannounced hardware during a livestream on April 1, making people think that it was an April Fool’s Day joke. However, Henderson later stressed that he wasn’t joking. According to Henderson, we’ll hear more about the hardware “soon.” In the interim, fans started speculating that a PS Vita 2 was possibly in the works. Enter journalist Jeff Grubb, who seemingly corroborated Henderson’s report in a tweet asking fans to keep their expectations in check because he’s “only ever heard about a cloud streaming handheld.” I am traveling to Super Nintendo World, but I see the reports about a potential Vita 2, and I would definitely scope down those expectations. I've only ever heard about a cloud-streaming handheld. Considering this report is coming from both Grubb and Henderson, we have reason to believe that there’s an atom of truth in this rumor. As previously reported, Sony is expected to hold a major PlayStation showcase before Summer Games Fest in June 2023. There’s a chance we’ll see this PlayStation handheld as well as the highly anticipated Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 at the event. Zarmena is a senior editor at PSLS. She has been with the site since 2014.
