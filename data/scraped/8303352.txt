ESPNâs Adam Schefter says that Aaron Rodgers realistically has two options left, and returning to the Green Bay Packers isnât one of them. The 2023 league year officially begins on March 15, which is the date when free agency signings can officially be announced. The quarterback market is going to be monitored heavily, but the big domino that needs to fall is Aaron Rodgers, who is still deciding about his status for the 2023 season. Even after going into a darkness retreat, Rodgers has not made up his mind as to whether he wants to return to the Green Bay Packers, play elsewhere, or retire, but says that a decision will come âsoon enough.â According to one NFL insider, there are only two options remaining. During an appearance on ESPNâs SportsCenter, senior NFL insider Adam Schefter said that his sense is that Rodgers will either choose to play for a new team, which would most likely be the New York Jets, or opt to retire. In regards to the Packers, Schefter says âthere continues to be more and more signs about him leaving Green Bay.â "My sense is ultimately it will come down to whether he wants to play elsewhere, which would be really the New York Jets, or whether he wants to retire. To me, those are the two most logical options and the two most likely scenarios here." -- @AdamSchefter "âWe have heard the Packers talk about Jordan Love and how much belief they have in him and how much progress heâs made,â said Schefter, h/t Bleacher Report. âAnd I think heâs their quarterback of the future here, clearly. And they continue to wait for the decision from Aaron Rodgers, who knows that at some point in time, heâs said the Packers have had conversations about him with other teams. And thatâs why I believe that itâs going to either be the New York Jets or retirement in the end. And weâll show how this shakes out, but thereâs nothing yet from Aaron Rodgers. It has to come soon.â" The Packers are in an interesting position in regards to quarterback. While Rodgers has won two NFL MVP awards in two of the past three seasons, the Packers used a 2020 first-round pick on Jordan Love, who is Rodgersâ successor. On May 1, the team has to decide whether they want to exercise his fifth-year option, or allow him to become a free agent after the 2023 season. Obviously, the fifth-year option would be the most ideal decision. When speaking with the media at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Ind., Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said that Love âneeds to play.â The Jets have been the most prominent landing spot for Rodgers if he were to request a trade. The team has a strong roster, but their quarterback play prevented them from making a run to the playoffs. A report from Pro Football Networkâs Tony Pauline indicated that the Jets were going to go âall outâ to acquire Rodgers. Not to mention, the Jets hired Nathaniel Hackett, who has a strong relationship with Rodgers during their time in Green Bay, as their new offensive coordinator. As for retirement, Rodgers openly discussed it in recent years, even dating back to the 2021 season. With the league year approaching soon, NFL fans will be waiting for an official Rodgers update. Based off Schefterâs comments, it appears a trade to the Jets or retirement are the most likely options for Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers trade suitors called Brandon Marshall after retirement post. dark.
