Our Bureau, Mumbai 




Nourish You, India’s maiden brand to get quinoa and chia to the country and consequently, the first homegrown superfood start-up, has announced acclaimed actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu has invested in the company. As the first to retail homegrown quinoa and chia seeds in India, it continues to lead in promoting locally-sourced and sustainable superfoods. Prabhu's investment comes as part of  seed funding round, which had earlier attracted pedigreed investors, including Y Janardhana Rao of Triumph Group; Rohit Chennamaneni, co-founder, Darwinbox; Nikhil Kamath, co-founder, Zerodha; Abhijeet Pai, co-Founder, Gruhas Proptech; Abhinay Bollineni, CEO, Kims Hospitals, among others.Prabhu said, "Investing in Nourish You was a natural progression since I have been consuming their products for a while. I was impressed by their story of bringing superfoods like Quinoa and Chia to India, growing them locally, and their product roadmap of millet based clean-label vegan superfoods. I believe that Nourish You can create value while making a positive impact on the health of consumers as well as the planet. I'm excited to partake in their innovative and sustainable approach to business."In addition to her investment, she has also launched the first plant-based, vegan, and lactose-free milk alternative - Millet Mlk. The new product marks the company's foray into the alternative dairy category, and is an outcome of two years of research on innovative millet-based products. The United Nations had declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets and the company is well-positioned to support Government of India’s vision to make India a global hub of millets. Krishna Reddy, co-founder, Nourish You, said, “We welcome Samantha to the Nourish You family; her thoughts on ancient foods are well aligned with ours. Her investment in the company is a testament to the products we have developed so far and the success we have achieved. We believe this partnership with Samantha will help us strengthen our position in the market as we unfold India’s superfood growth story.”
