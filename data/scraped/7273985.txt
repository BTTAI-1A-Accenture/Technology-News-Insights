Advertisement A virtuoso performance with bat and ball from Marco Jansen helped South Africa to a series-winning victory by 122-runs in the fifth and decisive one-day international at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Sunday.  An accomplished 93 from Aiden Markram and a fifth wicket partnership of 109 with David Miller helped South Africa recover from a shaky 103-4 to post a total of 315-9 before Jansen – having smashed a career-best 47 from just 23 balls – claimed the first five wickets to fall as the tourists stumbled to 193 all out in reply.  Jansen was on fire in the final five overs of South Africa’s innings after they were asked to bat first smashing four boundaries and three sixes to turn a respectable total into a highly competitive one before slicing a drive to short third man. Andile Phehlukwayo belted two fours and four sixes to finish with a magnificent flourish taking 24 off the final over from Michael Neser to finish with an unbeaten 39 from just 19 balls. There can be little doubt about whom the Proteas will turn to should they require an injury replacement in their 15-man squad at the World Cup.

 Jansen (8-1-39-5) was still on fire with the ball having David Warner (10) brilliantly caught by Markram at backward point, bowling Josh Inglis (0) of a bottom edge and persuading the counter-attacking Mitchell Marsh (71 of 56 balls, 6x4, 6x6) to uppercut a bouncer to third man where Lungi Ngidi held a fine, running catch. Another bouncer had Marnus Labuschagne (44) caught by Phehlukwayo at long leg and Jansen completed his fifer when Alex Carey (2) gloved yet another, aggressive short ball through to ‘keeper Quinton de Kock. Keshav Maharaj (9.1-2-33-4) sliced through the lower order and Phehlukwayo (1-44) completed a memorable match with a wicket to go with his batting cameo as the home side completed their comeback from 2-0 in the series to prevail 3-2. 🇿🇦 PROTEAS COMEBACK TO WIN THE SERIES The Proteas have made an excellent comeback to win the #Betway ODI series 3-2 against Australia 🇿🇦🇳🇿Congratulations to the entire team 👏 #BePartOfIt #SAvAUS pic.twitter.com/33Mc3QGXQV 

 Markram’s composed innings came hot on the heels of his unbeaten 102 in the third match Potchefstroom facing 87 balls and collecting nine fours and three sixes as he calmly rebuilt the innings on a well-grassed pitch offering generous movement to the seamers. Miller, too, was patient initially requiring 59 balls to reach his 50 before attempting to accelerate and holing out in the deep against Sean Abbott for a responsible 63 from 65 balls with four fours and three sixes. Earlier Proteas captain, Temba Bavuma, was dismissed in unfortunate circumstances when he was hit in the ribs by the second ball of the match from Neser and was immediately called for a leg-bye by opening partner de Kock. He was understandably late to respond which allowed Labuschagne to take aim and score a direct hit at the non-striker’s end. De Kock (27 from 39 balls) was caught at slip in his final ODI innings on home soil while Rassie van der Dussen (30 from 48 balls) drove Abbott straight to cover where Labuschagne held a stinging catch. Legspinner Adam Zampa (3-71) enjoyed some revenge against Heinrich Klaasen after the mauling he received at Supersport Park on Friday when he slipped a quick, flat delivery past the bat and onto off-stump to dismiss him for a modest six from 13 balls. He later trapped Gerald Coetzee lbw and bowled Keshav Maharaj with successive deliveries, both without scoring. Just as Markram appeared destined for a second 100 in the series he slog-swept part-time offspinner Tim David’s first ODI delivery to deep midwicket where Neser took the catch. As it transpired, he had done more than enough.
