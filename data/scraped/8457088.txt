Dogetti (DETI) – A Strong Community Approach to NFTs



Dogetti distinguishes itself by placing a strong emphasis on community and unity. The platform adopts a unique approach by referring to its holders as “The Family.” Inspired by mafia-themed books and films, Dogetti aims to create a sense of exclusivity and togetherness among its users.

The primary goal of Dogetti is to enhance the overall net worth of its Family members. Through a 2% reflection protocol, holders are regularly rewarded. Additionally, Dogetti incorporates DogettiDAO and DogettiNFTs, allowing the Family to actively participate in decision-making processes. By giving the community a voice through voting and involvement, Dogetti empowers its members to shape the future of the ecosystem.

Its user-friendly interface and extensive collection make it a go-to platform for both experienced collectors and newcomers.
