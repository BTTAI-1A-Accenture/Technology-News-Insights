The local share market was down for a second day, with every sector in the red except for energy. At noon AEST on Tuesday, the S&P/ASX200 index was down 39.8 points, or 0.55 per cent, to 7190.6, while the All Ordinaries had fallen 37.8 points, or 0.51 per cent, to 7390.3. The two days of losses means the ASX200 has now given up all but five points of its 92.5-point rally on Friday, its best day this year. "You can't blame people for keeping to the sidelines, for now," wrote Capital.com market analyst Kyle Rodda. "In the absence of major data or surprising news, price action was dull last night as the markets brace for a cast of central bank meetings." No fewer than six central banks will make policy decisions this week, including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan. The release shortly before lunchtime of Reserve Bank minutes from its September 5 meeting didn't seem to budge the market much. The minutes indicated the board debated raising rates at its last meeting and was still open to doing so, but was also mindful of the risk that the economy might slow more sharply than forecast. Many economists believe the RBA has reached an end of its rate-hiking cycle, with a minority predicting a final hike in November. The energy sector was up 0.6 per cent as Brent crude spiked above $US94 a barrel for the first time since last November amid production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia. Woodside was up 0.4 per cent, Santos had added 1.0 per cent, and coalminer New Hope gained 3.4 per cent. In the heavyweight mining sector, goldminers were shining as the price of the yellow metal neared a two-week high of $US1935 an ounce. Evolution was up 2.1 per cent, Newcrest had added 1.4 per cent, and Northern Star had advanced 1.2 per cent. The iron ore giants were mostly down, with BHP slipping 0.9 per cent and Fortescue dropping 1.0 per cent, while Rio Tinto had edged very slightly higher. All of the "Big Four" banks were in the red, with NAB and ANZ both down by 1.1 per cent, Westpac falling 0.8 per cent, and CBA dipping 0.9 per cent. Back in the mining sector, Boart Longyear was up 6.4 per cent to $1.49 as the drilling services company announced a subsidiary had agreed to buy a Swedish company that makes geological data visualisation software for $US29.3 million. Boart Longyear said the combination of its Veracio unit and Minalyze AB would accelerate data and AI in global ore-body knowledge. Tuas was up 11.1 per cent to $2.11 as the Singapore-based mobile company reported its full-year loss had narrowed to $S15.3 million ($A17.4 million), from $S26.7 million ($A30.4 million) the previous year. The Australian dollar was buying 64.30 US cents, from 64.45 US cents at Monday's ASX close. Sign up for our emails Find out More Â© West Australian Newspapers Limited 2024
