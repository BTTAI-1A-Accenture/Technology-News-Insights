It has been revealed that CD Projekt Red used artificial intelligence to recreate the voice of Polish artist Miłogost Reczek — with the permission of the family — in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty. The actor was an integral part of the game as he played the role of Dr. Victor Vektor. Unfortunately, he passed away back in 2021. The original idea was to hire a different voice actor for this role and rerecord his lines in the original game. However, CDPR’s localization director, Mikolaj Szwed, did not like this approach. We didn’t like this approach as Reczek was one of the best Polish voice talents and his performance in the game as the doctor Viktor Vektor was stellar. Instead, they decided to use voice-cloning software Respeecher to make the dialogue sound like Miłogost Reczek. This way we could keep his performance in the game and pay tribute to his wonderful performance as Viktor Vektor. To make it happen, they first contacted the deceased actor’s family, and his sons ‘were very supportive’ of this idea and approved. The localization team went to great lengths to ensure that the original voiceover remained the same, and in the process, they also paid tribute to Miłogost Reczek. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty has been a turnaround that players had been waiting for. In our review, we describe it as one of the best gaming experiences of 2023.
