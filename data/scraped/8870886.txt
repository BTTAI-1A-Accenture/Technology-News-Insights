 GMA Kapuso Foundation's blood donation project is returning after three years.  According to a "24 Oras" report, Wednesday, the "Sagip Dugtong Buhay" project is happening at Ever Commonwealth, Quezon City on February 26.  Among those who have been donating blood to help others is Luisito Mendoza, who has been doing it once every one or two years.  There's also corporal Silverio Cabido, who was shot in 2017. He now donates his own blood after having a hard time looking for his blood type when he needed it the most.  "'Yung pagkatama ko, hindi ko dinibdib at pinroblema kasi buhay pa 'ko. Kailangan kong tulungan 'yung mga nangangailangan," he said.  The GMA Kapuso Foundation is also accepting cash donations through bank deposits, Cebuana Lhuillier, GCash, Shopee, PayMaya, Zalora, MegaMart, Globe Rewards, Metrobank credit card, and Lazada.
