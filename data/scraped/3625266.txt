ROSELAND, NJ — /PRNewswire/ — Private sector employment increased by 296,000 jobs in April and  annual pay was up 6.7 percent year-over-year, according to the April ADP® National Employment Report™ produced by the ADP Research Institute® in collaboration with the Stanford Digital Economy Lab ("Stanford Lab"). The jobs report and pay insights use ADP's fine-grained anonymized  and aggregated payroll data of over 25 million U.S. employees to provide  a representative picture of the labor market. The report details the  current month's total private employment change, and weekly job data  from the previous month. ADP's pay measure uniquely captures the  earnings of a cohort of almost 10 million employees over a 12-month  period. "The slowdown in pay growth gives the clearest signal of what's going on in the labor market right now," said Nela Richardson,  chief economist, ADP. "Employers are hiring aggressively while holding  pay gains in check as workers come off the sidelines. Our data also  shows fewer people are switching jobs."
