The Poplar Bluff R-I school district has chosen Dr. Aaron Cornman to succeed Dr. Scott Dill as R-1 superintendent when the latter retires at the end of the 2022-23 school year.  Cornman currently serves as the superintendent at East Prairie, a position he has held since 2021. I greatly appreciate the Poplar Bluff Board of Education affording me the opportunity to serve as superintendent of schools in a district with such a rich heritage that celebrates the success of students and continually seeks to grow academic offerings for all students in the district, Cornman said in a press release by the R-1 district. The R-1 school board chose Cornman from a field of four finalists during a special meeting held Thursday. Information on the meeting was released Sunday.  The position of superintendent is very important to the school district, R-I board member Roger Hanner said. The process of selecting a superintendent is one of the hardest decisions a school board member can make and is not taken lightly. We had very strong candidates apply for the position. Im looking forward to seeing what Dr. Cornman will achieve as the leader of our district. Prior to leading the East Prairie school district, Cornman previously was employed for more than a decade in total as a superintendent at Hillsboro, Pierce City and Walnut Grove. My career serving as a superintendent has spanned both small and large districts as well as rural and metropolitan. One constant remains the same: kids, Cornman said. The good work we do is predicated on making decisions in the best interest of the students and families we serve. Poplar Bluff is no different. I am committed to working daily with our staff, administrative team, and greater school community in offering educational opportunities that enrich the lives of students. A native of Gideon, Cornmans career in education began in 1999 as a fifth-grade teacher at Risco before working in special education at Malden. After several years at Malden, Cornman took a position at Advance as special education director and as elementary principal.  Cornman joined the superintendent ranks in 2007, where he has worked since, with the exception of a short sabbatical because of a serious health diagnosis his mother received.
