A photographer on safari in Kenya has captured rare footage showing an enormous python navigating a shallow stream. The footage was captured in the Mara Triangle by Ollie Outram, an associate snake handler for East African Reptiles. The research group stated via Instagram: “Pythons are very comfortable in water and usually use wildlife trails leading down to water to ambush their prey. They are very good swimmers and can spend quite sometime underwater.” A post shared by East African Reptiles (@eastafricanreptiles)  East African Reptiles explained that Southern African rock pythons can measure about 20 feet and the snake in the footage appears to be fully grown. The group added: “They are a harmless constrictor, but a bite from a large python can cause significant damage and will need treatment from a doctor.” Sign up for our newsletter to get updates to your inbox, and also receive offers from us, our affiliates and partners.
