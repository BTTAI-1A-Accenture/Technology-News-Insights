PITTSBURGH, Aug. 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- "I wanted to create an improved disposable diaper for male dogs who experience periodic seizures," said an inventor, from Chanhassen, Minn., "so I invented the DOGGY DIAPER. My design would provide maximum protection against urine escape." 



 The invention provides a new disposable diaper for male pet dogs. In doing so, it allows for complete absorption of pet urine. As a result, it eliminates the potential for liquid escape and it increases comfort and protection. The invention features an effective and flexible design that is easy to apply and remove so it is ideal for pet owners with male dogs, especially those who experience seizures, animal shelters, veterinarian offices, etc. Additionally, it is producible in various sizes and a prototype is available.
