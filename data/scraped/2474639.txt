            Always maintaining the materials in the form of modules give immense access to the team members for better access and evaluation   For strict and traditional predictive projects, with central project management and a formal quality control, where extensive use of documentation and reports is a must, the QA must be well documented and defined at least with good amount of information at the planning phase (Updated accordingly during project lifecycle).
On the other hand (or "end") for complex environments, with frequent changes, in adaptive approach, remember one of the Agile manifesto "working software over comprehensive (and extensive) documentation". It doesn´t mean there aren´t any QA training material, the are just leaner and updated frequently during every sprint.
On both sides, the material must always be updated in company´s process assets repository for future. 
One way to maintain your QA training materials is to use a consistent format and structure for all your documents, presentations, videos, or other media. This will help you organize your content, avoid duplication or inconsistency, and make it easier for your learners to access and follow your materials. You can use templates, style guides, or content management systems to create and store your QA training materials in a standard format.
 
Another way to maintain your QA training materials is to incorporate feedback from your learners, trainers, managers, and customers. Feedback can help you improve the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of your materials, as well as identify any errors, gaps, or outdated information. You can collect feedback through surveys, quizzes, interviews, or observations, and use it to revise or enhance your materials accordingly.

            Incorporating feedback is a dynamic process that involves gathering both qualitative and quantitative insights.

Qualitative feedback captures the details of individual experiences, shedding light on the 'why' behind learners' perceptions. It can help identify aspects of the training that resonate with learners, offering valuable insights into what contributes towards engagement and understanding.

Open-ended questions can uncover unexpected challenges or positive outcomes that may not be apparent through quantitative measures alone.

Quantitative feedback provides the necessary foundation for objective analysis. Measures such as quiz scores and learner reactions offer a broad understanding of the overall effectiveness of the training. 
Another way to maintain your QA training materials is to use multiple methods and formats to deliver your content. Different learners have different preferences, learning styles, and needs, so you should offer them a variety of options to suit their interests and goals. You can use online or offline, synchronous or asynchronous, formal or informal, or interactive or passive methods to provide your QA training materials. For example, you can use e-learning modules, webinars, podcasts, manuals, guides, checklists, games, simulations, or case studies.
 
Another way to maintain your QA training materials is to update them regularly to reflect any changes in your products, processes, or standards. You should monitor and review your materials periodically to ensure that they are accurate, current, and compliant with the latest best practices and regulations. You should also communicate any changes or updates to your learners and trainers, and provide them with the necessary support and resources to adapt to the new materials.
 
Another way to maintain your QA training materials is to evaluate the results and outcomes of your QA training program. You should measure and analyze the impact of your materials on your learners' knowledge, skills, behavior, and performance, as well as on your business goals and customer satisfaction. You should also compare the results with your expectations and benchmarks, and identify any areas for improvement or innovation. You should use the results to inform and guide your future decisions and actions regarding your QA training materials.

Level 1 - Reaction: This focuses on learners' immediate reaction, satisfaction and the perceived relevance of the learning experience. This helps understand the initial engagement and interest.

Level 2 - Learning: This assesses the actual knowledge and skills acquired. It's essential for understanding the effectiveness of the training in translating information into practice.

Level 3 - Behaviour: This evaluates whether the training has led to observable changes in behaviour and performance. This is important to understand the real-world impact of the training.
