     Fox Nation host Nancy Grace joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her trip to Aruba and the search for answers on the mysterious 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway. The parents of a Massachusetts teenager who died after she was struck by a boat while tubing in Aruba last year are speaking out in the hopes of raising awareness and preventing further tragedies, according to local reports.  Cassidy Murray, 13, was tubing in the Caribbean island in March 2022 when she fell into the water, according to several reports. The driver of the boat was approaching Cassidy when he "lost control" and struck the budding teen, said her father, Dave Murray, to ABC News.  "She was in the water, had a life jacket on. I waved at her. She was safe," Murray told the news station. "As [the boat driver] approached Cassidy, just as he got to her, he lost control of the boat. ... He pulled it in full throttle."

NANCY GRACE, NATALEE HOLLOWAY'S MOTHER RETURN TO ARUBA IN SEARCH FOR JUSTICE Local authorities reportedly determined there was no cause for criminal charges. The family is now working with Aruban authorities to spread awareness and stop similar tragedies before they start. "We didn’t know the dangers. We weren’t aware. We want to create awareness," Linda Murray, Cassidy's mother, told WCVB.com. "If we can save one family, one child, we’ve honored Cass and created awareness." Among efforts, the Murrays are reportedly asking Aruban officials to establish and enforce water safety protocols, such as mandating that a second person be added to support drivers on water sports vessels.  Tourists walk along a street in Oranjestad, Aruba on August 27, 2013.  (LUIS ACOSTA/AFP via Getty Images) Murray noted that her daughter "died so tragically, so unnecessarily." "We quickly learned we have to participate in life even though we don’t want to," she told WCVB. "Our goal has always been to create awareness to prevent another family from going through this."
