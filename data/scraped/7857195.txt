The stock underperformed after the company pre-announced underwhelming third-quarter results that highlighted a sharp rise in channel partner inventories. Fears that the company has increased production capacity while installation bottlenecks continue to persist and consumer demand for its residential power generation products could be decelerating, plus a bankruptcy filing from one of its notable clean energy customers, also weighed on the shares.
