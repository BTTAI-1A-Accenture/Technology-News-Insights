Kelly has a criminal history. You can read more about that here. Allison Parker, a young mother and medical assistant, was named as one of the deceased victims. In an evening news conference, the Memphis police chief, C.J. Davis,
 gave a detailed timeline, revealing that four people were shot to death, another three were shot, and an eighth victim was carjacked but uninjured. The two shot men were found in a driveway and vehicle. The man shot in the AutoZone is in critical condition. Davis confirmed the suspect was live streaming during that shooting through the page “Zeke Huncho.” Authorities are investigating whether there are other shooting scenes as well. The deceased victims are two men and two women. They have not been named.

One video clip captures the random shooting in the AutoZone. The URL of the Facebook page reads, “bankboy Zeek.” It has now been deleted, but Heavy saved numerous posts and photos from it, which you can read later in the story.

One video clip, which you can watch below, shows the active shooter walking into the store and randomly shooting a man within seconds of walking inside. The man is simply standing in the aisle of the store and doing absolutely nothing wrong. “No fakin’, no fakin’. This s*** for real…” the active shooter said nonchalantly as he walked in the store. The Zeek Huncho Facebook page is full of photos of a man with guns and wads of cash. Here’s what you need to know:
