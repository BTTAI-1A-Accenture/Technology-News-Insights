You can check snowfall predictions for Oregon with our exclusive snowfall map. This winter, exclusively for subscribers, OregonLive has introduced an easy-to-use interactive map designed to show you exactly how much snow you can expect to pile up where you live and work during the next 72 hours. Developed in partnership with a meteorological consulting firm, OregonLive’s map runs data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through what’s called the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Model. It’s designed for accuracy down to a two-mile radius. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
