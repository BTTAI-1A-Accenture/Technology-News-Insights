Starman leads Bal De Rio over the last © Photo Healy Racing The patiently-ridden Starman (4/1), in the shop window at a price of 5,000 Euros, ran out an easy winner of the Slievenamon Claiming Hurdle under James O'Sullivan. A maiden hurdle winner at Wexford in June, the seven-year-old was getting into contention when blundering two out but quickly shrugged off that error to head Bal De Rio before the last and he raced clear on the run-in to beat that rival by eight lengths. Declan Queally  jnr, son of trainer Declan and assistant, said: "He was for in small money as he has had a couple of niggly problems and he is keen. However seven runners suited, James (O'Sullivan) knows him so it was grand. "He might be claimed so we'll see what happens. "His owner Michael Ronayne passed away before the Galway festival and it is nice that the horse has won." The winner was claimed for E5,000 by by owner/trainer Anthony McCann. Fourth-placed Rotten Row was claimed (for E15,000) by Jerry McGrath (UK) to be trained by Gary Hanmer in the UK and fifth home Coole Arcade was claimed (for E5,000) by David O'Sullivan to be trained by Charles Coakley Quotes from Tom Weekes
