 While many companies are now offering access to general-purpose quantum computers, they're not currently being used to solve any real-world problems, as they're held back by issues with qubit count and quality. Most of their users are either running...

 Because quantum computing has been attempted via multiple approaches, those approaches can be a bit confusing to follow. Most quantum computing efforts go toward what are called gate-based computers, which allow you to perform logical operations on...

 Early on in D-Wave's history, the company made bold claims about its quantum annealer outperforming algorithms run on traditional CPUs. Those claims turned out to be premature, as improvements to these algorithms pulled the traditional hardware back...

 Today, quantum computing company D-Wave is announcing the availability of its next-generation quantum annealer, a specialized processor that uses quantum effects to solve optimization and minimization problems. The hardware itself isn't much of a...

 The D-Wave quantum annealer isn't a general-purpose computer, in that it can only solve a set of problems that can be structured as energy minimizations. And even on those problems, D-Wave employees will acknowledge that the current generation of...

 On Tuesday, D-Wave announced the details of its next-generation computation hardware, which it's calling "Advantage," and released a set of white papers that describe some of the machine's performance characteristics. While some of the details of the...

 Last week, D-Wave announced a new version of its quantum annealing computer. The new machine includes a number of technical improvements, as well as a significant change to the physical arrangement of the board. What does all this mean? Combined with...

 D-Wave's hardware has always occupied a unique space on the computing landscape. It's a general-purpose computer that relies on quantum mechanical effects to perform calculations. And, while other quantum-computer makers have struggled to put more...

 Machine learning has returned with a vengeance. I still remember the dark days of the late '80s and '90s, when it was pretty clear that the current generation of machine-learning algorithms didn't seem to actually learn much of anything. Then big...

 IBM has solved most of the science behind quantum computing. Time to make some money.

   D-Wave, a company based in British Columbia, has announced a new version of its quantum annealer: the D-Wave 2000Q. As the name suggests, the number of bits has increased from about 1,000 to just over 2,000. This is, for D-Wave, an important step on...

 We have been following D-Wave's claims about its quantum hardware at Ars for a number of years. Over that time, my impression has oscillated between skepticism, strong skepticism, and mild enthusiasm.

 Two years ago Google and NASA went halfsies on a D-Wave quantum computer, mostly to find out whether there are actually any performance gains to be had when using quantum annealing instead of a conventional computer. Recently, Google and NASA...

 D-Wave, a company we have covered extensively in the past, has taken some heat because a number of tests have shown that its adiabatic quantum optimizer is no faster than a regular computer. But the company is now claiming that its machine...

 I have to admit it: D-Wave is starting to produce some impressive results. For the uninitiated, D-Wave came to our attention by loudly and repeatedly claiming that it had built a quantum computer. Many of us were skeptical. Over time, though, D-Wave...

 When Lockheed Martin purchased one of D-Wave's computers, speculation ran riot in the streets. Was it going to be used to debug flight control systems? Maybe it would be used to solve design problems. Perhaps it could replace an intern and make the...

 Quantum optimizer manufacturer D-Wave Systems has been gaining a lot of traction recently. They've sold systems to Lockheed Martin and Google, and started producing results showing that their system can solve problems that are getting closer to...

 Back in 2007, a company called D-Wave made waves by claiming it had built a 16-bit quantum computer at a time when most academic labs could only manage a handful of bits. What they demonstrated, however, wasn't a quantum computer in the sense that...

 In 2007, D-Wave announced with great fanfare that it had developed the world's first commercial quantum computer. Unfortunately, details were rather scarce, and it was hard to confirm that anything quantum was going on in the company's device. In the...

  I admit that I have never been much of a fan of D-Wave, a company that used to claim that it made quantum computers and now claims to make quantum optimizers. But one of the things I have come to admire about the firm is its track record in...

  Way back in 2007, a company called D-Wave systems demonstrated... well, no one is really sure what it demonstrated. D-Wave claimed it was a quantum computer, but if that was so, then this tiny company managed to produce something that was way beyond...
