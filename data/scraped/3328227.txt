The Patriot is one of the most advanced air defence systems in the world, designed to work against a mix of aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The system has not been destroyed and Washington and Kyiv are in talks about the best way to repair it without removing it from Ukraine, one of the officials said on the condition of anonymity. Just hours earlier, Russia said it had destroyed the US-built surface-to-air missile defence system with a “hypersonic” Kinzhal missile. Vladimir Putin had issued a clear threat to damage and “weed out” the West-supplied Patriot anti-missile defence systems delivered to Ukraine. On the battlefield front, Ukrainian forces have taken back about 20 square km of territory from Russia around the eastern city of Bakhmut in recent days, Kyiv said. Patriot missile defence system likely damaged but not destroyed – reports Russia firing more weapons to overwhelm Ukraine, says US official Zelensky rallies support at EU council meet, cites battlefield success Russia rejects Kyiv’s claims on missiles downed Kyiv forces ‘reclaim significant ground around Bakhmut’ 03:53 , Arpan Rai The wave of Russian strikes has likely caused damage to the US-made Patriot missile defence system being used by Ukraine, two US officials said on Tuesday, adding that it did not appear to have been destroyed. Washington and Kyiv were already talking about the best way to repair the system and at this point it did not appear the system would have to be removed from Ukraine, one of the officials said on the condition of anonymity. The official added that the US would have a better understanding in the coming days and information could change over time. This comes just hours after Russia’s defence ministry said it had destroyed a US-built Patriot surface-to-air missile defence system with a “hypersonic” Kinzhal missile in an overnight strike on Ukraine but did not share more details. Vladimir Putin had issued a clear threat to damage and “weed out” the West-supplied Patriot anti-missile defence system to Ukraine. Ukraine shot down 18 Russian missiles overnight, including an entire volley of six Kinzhals. It was not clear which Western weapon Ukraine used. When asked about the Ukrainian claim, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu dismissed it. The Pentagon had no immediate comment. The Patriot is one of the most advanced US air defence systems, designed to work against a mix of aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. It typically includes launchers along with radar and other support vehicles. 12:28 , Matt Mathers The bank accounts of Finland’s embassy and consulate in Russia are frozen and the Nordic country has not had an explanation from its neighbour, the Finnish foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Finland, which has a long border with Russia, formally joined NATO on April 4 in a historic policy shift brought on by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that drew a threat from Moscow of counter-measures. Finnish foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters the bank accounts had stopped working on April 27. "The accounts of Finnish embassies have been frozen in Russia and at the moment they cannot be used," Haavisto said, adding the missions had been using their cash reserves to pay bills. Haavisto said Finland had sent Russian authorities a notice on May 4 requesting that Russia ensure the missions’ ability to function in Russia and asking for an official explanation for the freeze, but it had not received one so far. Russia’s central bank did not respond to a request for comment. 12:04 , Matt Mathers Three Russian academics who have worked on hypersonic missile technology face "very serious accusations", the Kremlin said on Wednesday, in a treason investigation that has spread alarm through Russia’s scientific community. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was aware of an open letter from Siberian scientists in defence of the men, but that the case was a matter for the security services. In the letter, published on Monday, colleagues of Anatoly Maslov, Alexander Shiplyuk and Valery Zvegintsev protested their innocence and said the prosecutions threatened to inflict grave damage on Russian science. "We know each of them as a patriot and a decent person who is not capable of doing what the investigating authorities suspect them of," they said. President Vladimir Putin has boasted that Russia is the global leader in hypersonic missiles, capable of travelling at speeds of up to Mach 10 (12,250 kph) to evade enemy air defences. On Tuesday, Ukraine said it had managed to destroy six of the weapons in a single night, although Russia disputed this. 11:32 , Matt Mathers The German government is looking into mechanisms to secure war damages for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the possibility of using Russian assets to compensate the country, a government spokesperson said on Wednesday. Chancellor Olaf Scholz was among European leaders who agreed to set up a register of damages for the Ukraine war during a meeting in Reykjavik this week. The UK’s prime minister Rishi Sunak, EU Commission president Usual von der Leyen and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, were among other attendees at the Council of Europe conference which primarily focused on the war: European nations zoom in on establishing system to pinpoint how much damage Russia caused in Ukraine 10:57 , Matt Mathers The number of Kazakhs who believe neighbouring Russia may invade the former Soviet republic has doubled over the past six months as the war in Ukraine continues, an opinion poll by Kazakh researchers showed on Wednesday. The Central Asian nation of 20 million has close historical, economic and security ties with Moscow, but has maintained neutrality in the Ukrainian conflict, refusing to recognise Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine’s territory. According to the poll of 1,100 respondents, carried out by non-government organisations MediaNet and PaperLab between May 3 and 12, almost 60% are also neutral with regards to the war, 12.8% support Russia and 21.1% support Ukraine, figures similar to those produced by a similar poll last December. However, the number of people who think Russia may also invade Kazakhstan has risen to 15% from 8.3% in the previous poll. Nearly a third of respondents said their perception of Russia had worsened because of the war, over a half said it had not changed and only 4.7% said it had improved. Kazakhstan is home to about 3 million ethnic Russians and shares the world’s longest continuous land border with Russia. Astana also has close ties with China, another giant neighbour, and the West, which has invested hundreds of billions of dollars into its oil and gas industry. 10:55 , Matt Mathers A Moscow court has ordered the arrest of prominent film producer Alexander Rodnyansky and theater director Ivan Vyrypaev for “spreading false information” about the Russian army. The initial court hearings against Rodnyansky and Vyrypaev were held on 27 April, but not reported by the court until Wednesday. According to the court’s press service, Rodnyansky and Vyrypaev, who are outside Russia, will be placed in custody once Russian authorities manage to detain them or to get them extradited. Russia’s Interior Ministry additionally put Vyrypaev on the federal wanted list. Kyiv-born Rodnyansky has been among the most influential figures in Russian cinema in recent decades. He left Russia after the start of the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has repeatedly spoken openly against the war. In October 2022, Russia’s Justice Ministry declared Rodnyansky a “foreign agent.” 09:39 , Matt Mathers Ukraine denied on Wednesday that a Russian hypersonic missile had destroyed a US-made Patriot missile defence system during an air strike on Kyiv. Russia’s defence ministry made the assertion on Tuesday after an overnight air attack on the Ukrainian capital. Two US officials later said a Patriot system had probably suffered damage but that it did not appear to have been destroyed. "I want to say: do not worry about the fate of the Patriot," Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat told Ukrainian television. He ruled out the possibility of a Russian "Kinzhal" missile knocking out a Patriot system. "Destroying the system with some kind of ‘Kinzhal’, it’s impossible. Everything that they say there, it can remain in their propaganda archive," he said. 09:04 , Matt Mathers The last ship left a port in Ukraine on Wednesday under a deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukraine grain a day before Russia could quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertilizer exports. The DSM Capella has left the port of Chornomorsk carrying 30,000 tonnes of corn and was on its way to Turkey, according to data issued by the United Nations. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the Black Sea deal for an initial 120 days in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that has been aggravated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the world’s leading grain exporters. Moscow agreed to extend the Black Sea pact for a further 120 days in November, but then in March it agreed to a 60 day extension - until May 18 - unless a list of demands regarding its own agricultural exports was met. 08:37 , Matt Mathers The United Nations is speedily trying to extend a deal that has allowed shipments of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea to parts of the world struggling with hunger - helping ease a global food crisis exacerbated by the war Russia launched more than a year ago. The breakthrough accord that the UN and Turkey brokered with the warring sides last summer came with a separate agreement to ease shipments of Russian food and fertiliser that Moscow insists has not been applied. Russia set a deadline of Thursday for its concerns to be ironed out or it is bowing out. Such brinkmanship is not new; with a similar extension in the balance in March, Russia unilaterally decided to renew the deal for 60 days instead of the 120 days outlined in the agreement. UN officials and analysts said a failure to extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative could hurt countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia that rely on Ukrainian wheat, barley, vegetable oil and other affordable food products, especially as drought takes a toll. The deal helped lower prices of food commodities like wheat over the last year but that relief has not reached kitchen tables. "If you have a cancellation of the grain deal again, when we’re already at a pretty tight situation, it’s just one more thing that the world doesn’t need, so the prices could start heading higher," said William Osnato, a senior research analyst at agriculture data and analytics firm Gro Intelligence. "You don’t see relief on the horizon." UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Monday the deal is "critical" and talks were ongoing. 08:11 , Matt Mathers Ukraine said on Tuesday that it downed six Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missiles in a single night, in what would be a major setback for Moscow’s efforts to develop an unstoppable next-generation weapon. It was not clear which air defense system Kyiv used to shoot down the missiles, but last week the US military confirmed that Ukraine had shot down a Kinzhal missile using the US.-produced Patriot system. What is the Patriot missile system? The Patriot, which stands for Phased Array Tracking Radar for Intercept on Target, is a theater-wide surface-to-air missile defense system built by Raytheon Technologies Corp and considered one of the most advanced air defense systems in the US arsenal. The system was first used in combat during the 1991 Gulf War, with batteries protecting Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, and later used during the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. Can Patriots stop hypersonic missiles? The Patriot system was designed before hypersonic weapons were sent to battlefield and Raytheon has not said publicly that the is effective against a missile flying at hypersonic speeds (anything above five times the speed of sound). While the US said that the Patriot system brought down last week’s Khinzal missile, it was not clear if that missile was traveling at hypersonic speed at the time. While Russia’s Kinzhal missile may reach speeds of up to 7,600 mph (12,350 kph), "Russia’s designation of the Kinzhal as a ‘hypersonic’ missile is somewhat misleading, as nearly all ballistic missiles reach hypersonic speeds (i.e. above Mach 5) at some point during their flight," the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a March 2022 report. 07:46 , Matt Mathers The apparent vulnerability of Russia’s Killjoy missiles is likely an “embarrassment” for the Kremlin, Britain’s Ministry of Defence has said. Ukraine for the first time shot down a Killyjoy air-launched ballistic missile on 3 May. “The increased air threat over Russia’s border region will be of exceptional concern for the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) because it uses the area to launch air power in support of the war,” the MoD said in its latest daily updates. “The apparent vulnerability of KILLJOY is likely a surprise and an embarrassment for Russia: Russian President Vladimir Putin has touted the system as undefeatable.” 07:20 , Matt Mathers China has notified several foreign missions in Beijing not to display "politicised propaganda" on their buildings, diplomats told Reuters, adding the request appeared aimed at Ukrainian flags they have displayed since Russia’s invasion. Several foreign missions in China raised the Ukrainian flag, or displayed its image in posters and lights, following the February 2022 invasion that sparked international condemnation of Russia, a close ally of China. "We and others got a letter calling on embassies and representative offices to refrain from using the outer walls of their buildings for ‘politicised propaganda’," one diplomat, whose embassy is displaying a Ukraine flag image, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. The diplomat said the mission did not intend to comply with the notification. 06:57 , Arpan Rai The last ship carrying out the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain will leave port today, a UN spokesperson said, a day before Russia could quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports. The last remaining ship at a Ukrainian port and will transit the maritime corridor with its cargo, the spokesperson said. Another vessel was in transit back to Turkey on Tuesday and five other ships are waiting for an outbound inspection in Turkish waters, the official said. The deal, which has ramifications for grain consumption across the world, was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey for an initial 120 days in July last year to help tackle a global food crisis that has been aggravated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, one of the world’s leading grain exporters. Moscow agreed to extend the Black Sea pact for a further 120 days in November, but then in March it offered only a 60 day extension, until 18 May, unless a list of demands regarding its own agricultural exports was met. 06:13 , Arpan Rai South Korea will provide a $130m (£104m) financial aid package to Kyiv after Ukraine’s first lady visited Seoul to seek military assistance. South Korea’s finance ministry said minister Choo Kyung-ho and Ukrainian economy minister Yulia Svyrydenko, in Seoul to attend a conference, signed the agreement on the package, which will consist of donations and aid loans. South Korea, a major producer of artillery shells, has said it was not providing lethal weapons to Ukraine, citing its relations with Russia. But South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol said in an interview with Reuters last month his government might not “insist only on humanitarian or financial support” if civilians in Ukraine come under a large-scale attack or because of a “situation the international community cannot condone”. 05:35 , Arpan Rai Russian forces are expending more weapons than usual in order to overwhelm and confuse Ukrainian air defences, a US official familiar with the matter told CNN. The expanded attacks seen this week may even work to Ukraine’s advantage, the official said, as the move forced Russia to scrape deeper into its restricted supply of precision munitions. Moscow has tried to target command and control centres in Kyiv and other high-value locations, the official said, as seen yesterday when Russia launched larger aerial attacks comprising drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles overnight from north, south and east direction in one go. 04:42 , Arpan Rai Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky bolstered his bid to seek more support for Ukraine as he spoke at the fourth summit of the Council of Europe and said that the war-hit nation is able to achieve battlefield successes unimaginable last year. “A year ago, we were not able to shoot down most of the terrorists’s missiles, especially ballistic ones. And I am asking one thing now: if we’re able to do this, is there anything we can’t do when we’re united and determined to protect lives? The answer is that we, in unity, will give one hundred per cent in any field – when we have a goal to protect our people and our Europe,” Mr Zelensky said. He presented Ukraine’s “historic” feat of downing cruise and ballistic missiles as he addressed the leaders virtually at the summit. “Today, Ukraine went through a difficult challenge – an intense Russian missile attack. Such challenges are what we all have to pay attention to now,” he said. “At three o’clock in the morning, our people woke up to explosions... Eighteen Russian missiles of different types were in our sky – in particular, ballistic ones, which the terrorist state has boasted about. We were told such missiles would bring a guaranteed death, because they are supposedly impossible to shoot down,” Mr Zelensky said. The war-time president said Russia used ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as drones, all at the same time – “to make it especially difficult for our air defence to save lives. But all lives were protected – all missiles were shot down, including ballistic ones. One hundred per cent! This is a historical result,” he said. 04:25 , Arpan Rai Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said the number of claimed Ukrainian missile intercepts in general is “three times greater than the number we [Moscow] launch”. “And they get the type of missiles wrong all the time. That’s why they don’t hit them,” he said, without elaborating. Ukraine said it had shot down six Russian Kinzhal missiles in a single night, taking down a weapon Moscow has branded as a next-generation hypersonic missile that was all but unstoppable. 03:00 , Joe Middleton Britain’s willingness to step first unto the breach over military support has spurred wider Western action, writes Kim Sengupta.

The EPF, created in 2021, is an off-budget instrument aimed at enhancing the EU’s ability to prevent conflicts, build peace and strengthen international security. “Hungary does not agree with the fact that the European Union, along with other existing tools, uses the European Peace Facility solely with regard to Ukraine as this does not allow sufficient funds to be channelled to promote the EU’s interests in other areas,” the government spokesman’s office said in an email response to Reuters about an Italian media report on the matter. The EU has provided a total of about 3.6 billion euros for military support for Ukraine so far under the EPF. Hungary, which is member of the EU and also NATO, has refused to provide any military equipment to its neighbour Ukraine, which was invaded by Russian forces in February 2022. Hungary has also repeatedly criticised EU sanctions against Russia, which all 27 EU countries must also unanimously approve, but eventually supported all the agreed measures so far. In power since 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has clashed with the EU and its executive arm, the European Commission, over Budapest restricting the rights of migrants, as well as tightening state controls over non-governmental organizations, academics, media and courts.

The vote in the State Duma came less than a week after President Vladimir Putin introduced a draft bill on May 10 “denouncing” the Treaty of Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which aimed to prevent Cold War rivals from massing forces at or near mutual borders. The deal was signed in November 1990, but not fully ratified until two years later. The Federation Council, Russia’s Kremlin-controlled upper chamber that generally rubber-stamps legislation that the Duma has approved, is scheduled to consider Russia’s pullout from the treaty next Wednesday.

Cyril Ramaphosa said he had spoken with Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky by phone over the weekend and they each agreed to host “an African leaders peace mission” in Moscow and Kyiv respectively. “Principal to our discussions are efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the devastating conflict in the Ukraine,” Mr Ramaphosa said. The leaders of Zambia, Senegal, Congo, Uganda and Egypt would make up the delegation along with Mr Ramaphosa, he said in a statement, and Mr Putin and Mr Zelenskyy gave him the go-ahead to “commence the preparations”. Four of the African countries - South Africa, Congo, Senegal and Uganda - abstained from a UN vote last year on condemning Russia’s invasion. Zambia and Egypt voted in favour of the motion. Mr Ramaphosa did not give a timeframe or outline any parameters for the possible peace talks. Mr Zelensky has previously said he would not consider a peace deal to end the 15-month war until Russian forces withdraw from Ukrainian territory.

All the weapons the UK has sent to Ukraine Tuesday 16 May 2023 14:00 , Emily Atkinson Ukraine has removed barriers to the export of some agricultural commodities, imposed last year to prevent food shortages, in a bid to boost foreign currency income, its government said on Tuesday. The country introduced export licences in 2022 to protect food supplies after agricultural production was hit by Russia’s invasion. While licensing did not ban exports, it made them much more difficult. The government said it would lift the requirement for export licences for live cattle, frozen cattle meat, chicken meat, eggs, rye, oats, millet and some other commodities. It said via the Telegram messaging app that the resolution was developed in response to numerous requests from associations, and would “help to optimise agricultural exports and increase foreign exchange earnings for Ukraine“. The decision would not affect supply to the domestic market, the government said. Ukraine is a major producer of poultry meat and exporter of grain and cereals. The European Union on 2 May set restrictions on imports of Ukrainian wheat, maize, rapeseed and sunflower seed to ease excess supply to Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Those states last week called for the curbs to be extended. Tuesday 16 May 2023 13:25 , Emily Atkinson Russia and Ukraine’s presidents have agreed to receive a group of African leaders to discuss a potential peace plan for the conflict, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa has said. “My discussions with the two leaders demonstrated that they are both ready to receive the African leaders and to have discussion on how this conflict can be brought to an end,” Ramaphosa told a joint press briefing with the Singapore prime minister. “Whether that will succeed or not is going to depend on the discussions that will be held,” he said. Ramaphosa said the peace plan was also backed by the leaders of Senegal, Uganda and Egypt, adding that the UN Secretary General, the United States and Britain had also been briefed about the initiative. Washington and London had expressed “cautious” support to the peace plan, Ramaphosa added.

It went on: “As well as progress to the south of town, Ukrainian assaults have forced back the Russian frontline to the north-west of the town. This has likely enabled Ukrainian forces to re-establish more secure use of the key 0506 supply road. “Ukraine is holding Russia’s western advances along the line of Donets-Donbas Canal, turning the waterway into an obstacle as part of a deep defensive zone around the town of Chasiv Yar.” Latest Defence Intelligence update on the situation in Ukraine - 16 May 2023.Find out more about Defence Intelligence's use of language: https://t.co/0FG6w4yI6a🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/BPDgNQ7Z39 — Ministry of Defence 🇬🇧 (@DefenceHQ) May 16, 2023 Tuesday 16 May 2023 09:09 , Emily Atkinson President Emmanuel Macron has reportedly signalled that France is ready to begin training Ukrainian fighter pilots. “We have opened the doors to training pilots alongside several other European countries, which are also ready; I believe the negotiations with the Americans are ongoing,” he said in an interview with broadcaster TF1 , according to Le Monde.
