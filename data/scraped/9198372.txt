Semiconductor stock Atomera Inc (NASDAQ:ATOM) is up 24.9% to trade at $6.52 today, after the company entered a deal to provide production technology to European chipmaker STMicroelectronics (STM). Yesterday after the close, Atomera reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that were in line with Wall Street's estimates. In response, Craig-Hallum hiked its price target to $17 from $13. Today's pop -- on track to be its largest single-session gain since February 2022 -- has ATOM trading at its highest level since mid-March. The shares are set to close above their 60-day moving average for the first time since in more than two months and are now 5.3% higher on the year. ATOM's typically quiet options pits are exploding today. Already, 1,416 calls and 233 puts have been exchanged, volume that's 53 times the average intraday volume. Most popular is the June 7.50 call, followed by the May 7.50 call. A short squeeze could provide additional tailwinds. In the two most recent reporting periods, short interest increased 5.6%, and the 4.48 million shares sold short represents 19.4% of ATOM's total available float.
