SMNI NEWS CHANNEL TRUTH THAT MATTERS AN army of red fire ants is fastly spreading across Queensland despite efforts to eradicate them. A new report showed the red fire ants are now just 23 kilometers north of the New South Wales border and the risk of them breaching the border is increasing. Fire ants are one of the world’s worst invasive pests and are currently contained in southeast Queensland since their discovery in 2001. The superpest however has crept closer to the New South Wales border and has been detected on the western side of the Great Dividing Range for the first time. The Invasive Species Council expressed concern that the ant had busted out of the containment zone and called for an extra $ 300 million per year to eradicate the ant. Australia considers fire ants more invasive than cane toads due to their very aggressive nature while their dominance could be lethal to humans and wildlife. Stings from red ants are painful and can cause a burning or itching sensation that can last up to an hour. A report released last week warned of an urgent change of strategy since 2021 to prevent the uncontrolled spread of one of the world’s most invasive species.
