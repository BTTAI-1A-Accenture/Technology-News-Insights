As Twitter was going through a technical outage that was affecting links and photos from working properly, ESPN sports personality Stephen A. Smith found the perfect time to dig up his most infamous tweet. Back in 2015, Smith tried to share a photo on his Twitter page with the phrase “TAke a look, y’all” attached. Well, he only managed to post the photo’s format name instead of the photo itself. As you could imagine, that hysterical tech flub has lived forever on Twitter whenever something doesn’t go right with someone’s post or with the platform itself. Well, with Monday’s Twitter issues in part affecting photos, Smith joked at himself a bit while sharing the perfect tweet for the moment. Via Twitter @stephenasmith Alright, for someone as self-serious as Smith, that’s a genuinely funny way of responding to whatever was going on with Twitter. While he’s not known for his ability to be self-deprecating, you’ve got to hand it to him for what will surely be one of the best tweets this week.
