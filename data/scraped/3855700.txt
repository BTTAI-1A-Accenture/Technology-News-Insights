Paul Terrell, owner of retail chain called The Byte Shop, placed an order for 50 Apple-1s and sold them for $666.66 (£420) retail - once Wozniak and Jobs agreed to assemble the circuit boards rather than offer them as kits. The usual price tag is believed to have been chosen because Wozniak liked repeating digits. Wozniak and Jobs hand-crafted 150 more Apple-1 machines and sold them to friends and other vendors. Fewer than 50 original Apple-1s are believed to have survived; only eight are known to be in working condition. Apple-1 did not have a keyboard or monitor, meaning users had to supply their own before they were able to use the computer. It also had 8K memory - tiny by today's standards.     Jobs sent them direct to buyers from the garage of his parents' house, now known as 'Apple Garage'. It is not known how many were sold during 1976, but by April 1977 the price had been dropped to $475 (£300).  But unlike many of the known Apple-1 computers, this 'sought-after' unit has not had any modifications to the physical board, and the prototype is 'clean and unused'.   The machine is now being sold off by RR Auction, an auction house based in Boston.  'The most remarkable aspect of this Apple-1 computer is that it is documented to be fully operational,' the auction house says. 'The system was operated without fault for approximately eight hours in a comprehensive test.' The listing includes the original Apple-1 board, marked in the hand of Steve Jobs with stock number '01-00002'.  On the left side, the board is embossed with the words: 'Apple Computer 1, Palo Alto, Ca. Copyright 1976.'  'Discrete' dates on the computer's components match other known Apple-1 boards of similar vintage, assembled and sold by Apple in autumn 1976 and early 1977. The machine has been authenticated as a genuine original by Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen, who restored it to its original operational state.  Also included in the listing are an original Apple-1 operation manual, ASCII keyboard, Sanyo 4205 video monitor and an Apple-1 Cassette Interface (ACI).  The sale will also be accompanied by a full letter of authenticity for Jobs' handwriting on the board.   Launched in 1976, Apple-1 was the first product to be developed under the Apple name by Jobs and co-founder Steve Wozniak.  Around 175 of 200 Apple-1 machines were sold in total, each carrying a price tag of $666.66 (equivalent to some $3,126 today).

Seeking a larger audience, Jobs approached Paul Terrell, owner of The Byte Shop in Mountain View, California, one of the first personal computer stores in the world.  Aiming to elevate the computer beyond the realm of the hobbyist, Terrell agreed to purchase 50 Apple-1 computers, but only if they were fully assembled.  Under this requisite, Apple-1 became one of the first 'personal' computers that did not require soldering by the end user.  Pictured, an original Apple-1 operation manual with firm's first established legal office address All together, over a span of about 10 months, Jobs and Wozniak produced about 200 Apple-1 computers and sold 175 of them.  The Apple-1 would pave the way for the development of the more advanced Apple II in early 1977, which came in a plastic housing with an integrated keyboard. Sale of the Apple II and its accessories and software saw Apple Computer's annual revenue rise from $774,000 to $118 million within just three years. Now, early Apple products are highly sought-after and fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction.   Earlier this year, a prototype for Apple-1, called 'Apple Computer A', was sold by RR Auction for $677,196 (more than £550,000).  The 'rare' and 'historic' item is essentially a circuit board covered in chips and wires, embossed with the words 'Apple Computer A ©76'.  In March 2020, another functioning Apple-1 model sold for $458,711 (around £335,000) at auction in Boston.

It is not known how many were sold during 1976, but by April 1977 the price had been dropped to $475 (£300). The first Apple computer helped kick-start a technological revolution that brought affordable computers out of science labs and into people's homes. The Apple II was introduced in April 1977 with an integrated keyboard, sound, a plastic case, and eight internal expansion slots. By the time it was discontinued in October 1977, around 200 Apple 1s had been produced. It is thought that only 30 to 50 of the computers still exist today.
