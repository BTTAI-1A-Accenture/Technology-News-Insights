Recruiting laboratory staff can be a challenging and rewarding process, especially in a competitive and dynamic field like laboratory management. You want to find qualified, motivated, and reliable candidates who can perform various tasks, follow protocols, and collaborate with others. But how do you attract, assess, and retain the best talent for your laboratory? Here are some best practices to help you with your laboratory staff recruitment and training.
 
Before you start looking for candidates, you need to have a clear idea of what you need in terms of skills, qualifications, experience, and personality. You can use your existing job descriptions, performance reviews, and feedback from current staff to identify the essential and desirable criteria for each position. You should also consider your laboratory's culture, vision, and goals, and how they align with the expectations and values of potential candidates.

            Clear and concise roles and compensation. One of the issues in lab recruitment is the lack of clarity for potential applicants. That coupled with the long hiring process and misleading growth potential causes the frequency in turnover.  
Once you have defined your needs, you need to communicate them effectively to your target audience. You can use various channels, such as online platforms, social media, professional networks, or referrals, to reach out to potential candidates. Your job ads should be concise, clear, and compelling, highlighting the benefits and opportunities of working in your laboratory, as well as the main responsibilities and requirements of the role. You should also include relevant keywords, contact details, and application instructions.
 
After you have received applications, you need to screen and interview candidates to evaluate their suitability for the role. You can use various methods, such as phone calls, video calls, online tests, or in-person interviews, depending on your resources and preferences. You should prepare a set of questions that cover the technical, behavioral, and situational aspects of the job, as well as the candidates' motivation and fit for the laboratory. You should also use objective and consistent criteria to compare and rank candidates.

            Personal contact with candidates is important, especially now within online hiring processes. Within that contact both parts should understand each others needs and elaborate on the next steps. Depending on the company‚Äôs size and vacancies the first contact could vary from personal conversations to impersonal ones, like tests.
However, the company and hiring team must identify the ranking criteria together and be flexible if the candidate has all must have criteria and is missing some of the ‚Äúcould learn‚Äù criteria.  
Once you have selected the best candidates, you need to train and onboard them effectively to ensure their success and retention in your laboratory. You should provide them with a comprehensive and customized induction program that covers the laboratory's policies, procedures, standards, and expectations, as well as the specific skills and knowledge they need for their role. You should also assign them a mentor or a buddy who can guide them, support them, and monitor their progress.
 
Finally, you should evaluate and improve your recruitment and training process regularly to ensure its efficiency and effectiveness. You can use various metrics, such as time to hire, cost per hire, quality of hire, turnover rate, or employee satisfaction, to measure the outcomes and impacts of your process. You should also solicit feedback from candidates, new hires, and existing staff to identify the strengths and weaknesses of your process, and implement changes accordingly.
