SAN MATEO, Calif., Jan. 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- BrightEdge, the global leader in organic search and content performance, announced today its continued transformation as an AI-First company. Driven by the industry's first and most powerful deep learning engine, DataMind, BrightEdge is making it easier for marketers to deliver a better customer experience and increased performance across all digital channels, content marketing and organic search. As BrightEdge marks its 10-year anniversary in 2018, the company is emerging as a leader in artificial intelligence with the launch of several cutting-edge innovations powered by DataMind.  The need for AI in the post-mobile worldRecent BrightEdge research revealed that not only is the customer journey predominantly digital, but also that this digital journey is entering the post-mobile world. Currently 57 percent of all searches are now conducted from mobile devices and over 20 percent of mobile searches are voice-activated. In this post-mobile world, it is increasingly difficult for brands to reach the connected consumer in an authentic way. To this point, BrightEdge research found that over 80 percent of content produced is never found by its audience. By 2020, customer experience will overtake price and product as the key differentiator between brands. The need to change and adapt to the connected consumer requires marketers to tackle one of their biggest challenges head on - the over-abundance of data and the value of insights that can be derived from this. For marketers, there is simply too much data out there to process, segment and analyze. Data is often unstructured and scattered across multiple data sets, making it hard to use.  Despite having access to data, marketers often struggle to transform this data into actionable insights.  The AI and Deep Learning Journey To solve this challenge, successful brands recognize that AI, deep learning and automation are now mission-critical for staying ahead of market trends, consumer preferences, and competitive shifts in the market. DataMind, BrightEdge's proprietary deep-learning engine, organizes and makes sense of all relevant data ? at a size and scale not possible manually. Unlike simple machine learning, deep learning requires both powerful computing power and massive amounts of relevant data. Machine learning uses thousands of data points, whereas deep learning uses millions. Successful companies of the future will dominate their markets by bringing together digital marketing, search and content marketing to deliver consistent digital experiences across all customer touch points, including web, mobile, email and social to create a strong competitive advantage.  "For the past several years, BrightEdge has been on a journey to become an Artificial-Intelligence (AI-First) company," said Jim Yu, CEO and Co-founder of BrightEdge.  "We believe that it is essential for every business to have AI-First capabilities. For BrightEdge, this journey started with the Data Cube nearly 10 years ago. Since then, we were first to market with a next-generation deep-learning technology, DataMind, using the same deep-learning best practices applied by Google in its voice and image recognition algorithms. DataMind has been woven into the BrightEdge Platform to power search, content, and digital marketing solutions that will power our customers on their own AI-First journey".    "Digital marketing has become very complex from opportunity identification through content creation to optimization. BrightEdge brings the AI firepower to my job and makes it easier for me to succeed."
