Gas, the social app that allows people to share compliments to one another, has been acquired by Discord. Popularized by teens, Gas seems to be the antithesis of what YikYak used to be (and potentially still is since its return). Also veiled in anonymity, Gas is inherently designed for spreading the love, with polls and prompts.  In a blog post on Tuesday, Discord announced that Gas "will continue as its own standalone app," while the Gas team will join Discord's. Details of the acquisition have not been provided.  "Gas is all about uplifting and empowering each other through positive affirmations. Its tremendous success shows the opportunity that exists in creating a playful yet meaningful place for young people," reads the statement. Founded by former Meta employee Nikita Bier, Gas has hit several milestones in the last few months. The app bagged the top spot on the App Store back in October, surpassing even TikTok; later in December, Bier shared on Twitter that Gas had hit 10 million downloads. Bier was the co-founder of TBH, an app with a similar function to that of Gas, which was bought, then shut down by Facebook less than three months after it was launched. On Discord's part, the move is an expansion in its emphasis on communities. The chat platform, which has moved beyond its core gaming community, allows users to hang out in channels with various tools for communication offered. The app currently has 150 million monthly active users. Gas is still primarily used by teens, but perhaps this acquisition will further its reach. Who doesn't want a compliment?
