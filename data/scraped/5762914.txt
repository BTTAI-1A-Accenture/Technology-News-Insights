Expedia Group stock traders use a variety of tools to make a prediction on which way the EXPE market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to make a Expedia Group stock forecast, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular Expedia Group stock prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for EXPE stock over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for EXPE is a sum of EXPEâs closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the stock market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the Expedia Group stock price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Expedia Group stock. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually interpreted as a negative forecast for the EXPE market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the Expedia Group stock price. When making a Expedia Group stock forecast, most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Expedia Group stock with different granularity â for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Letâs use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into âcandlesâ that give us information about Expedia Groupâs stock price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display EXPEâs opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that Expedia Group reached within the 1-hour period. This information makes it easier to make an informed price prediction. Itâs also important to pay attention to the color of the candle â a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing. Just like with any other asset, the price action of Expedia Group stock is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental factors, such as earnings announcements, new product launches, acquisitions and mergers, and other factors. The EXPE stock price can also be influenced by market sentiment, broader economic conditions, interest rates, inflation rates and political developments. Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making a stock price prediction to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.
