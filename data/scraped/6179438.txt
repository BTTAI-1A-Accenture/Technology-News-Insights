TD Cowen analyst Charles Rhyee maintained a Buy rating on GoodRx Holdings (GDRX – Research Report) today and set a price target of $12.00. Charles Rhyee has given GoodRx Holdings a Buy rating due to a variety of factors. Primarily, his assessment is based on their strong third-quarter estimated EBITDA of $54.2M and revenue of $190M, which surpasses consensus figures. Furthermore, Rhyee expects the attention to center on the impact of GoodRx’s partnerships with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which are set to begin in 2024, and the effect of direct contracting.  From the third quarter of 2023, GoodRx will no longer be affected by the Kroger issue, allowing investors to focus on the business’s potential and its PBM partnerships. GoodRx has recently signed agreements with MedImpact and Navitus, demonstrating the value of its discount benefit for PBMs and their plan sponsors. Despite the partnerships not becoming operational until 2024, Rhyee believes investors will concentrate on any company commentary that may provide insight into their potential impact on 2024’s financials. Lastly, although direct contracting with pharmacies may cause minor degradation in PTR per MAC, Rhyee sees this as a positive move to strengthen GoodRx’s relationships with pharmacies and potentially increase volume. In another report released on October 12, Bank of America Securities also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $9.50 price target. See today’s best-performing stocks on TipRanks >>
