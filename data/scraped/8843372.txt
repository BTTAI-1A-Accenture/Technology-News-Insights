 Project Slayers is a Roblox game themed after Demon Slayer, one of my favorite animes. The game allows me to live out my fantasy of being a Demon Slayer, whether I am training, leveling up, or felling ever-greater foes. Although jumping right into Project Slayers as a new player can be intimidating, the developers have released a Project Slayers guide on the website Trello. Here's where you can find the Project Slayers Trello link. The Project Slayers Trello (hyperlinked here). On this board, players can find an extensive guide on the different aspects of Project Slayers, such as Breathing Styles, important locations, and Demon Blood Arts. The board also contains descriptions of the game's bosses, as well as their attack styles. This Trello board is useful for anyone who finds the new player experience confusing and would like a rundown on the game's mechanics. It is also helpful for adept players looking for a rare boss item drop. Although the Trello board is a beneficial resource, we also have several Project Slayers guides available here on Pro Game Guides.
