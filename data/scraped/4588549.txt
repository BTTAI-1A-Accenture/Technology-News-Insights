Salut! They’ll age like a fine bottle. Whether wine is part of your everyday wind-down, or a special occasion treat, sometimes you’ll get the urge to snap a picture of an especially delicious bottle of wine or take a selfie of you and your friends sipping at a vineyard and post it to the ‘gram. And because you’ll be looking at the world through rosé-colored glasses, coming up with a clever caption may be a littler fuzzier than it normally is. These wine captions for Instagram, Facebook, and more, will come in handy whether you’re having a solo glass of wine after the kids are in bed, sharing a romantic dinner with your partner, or having a girls night in.  From famous quotes about drinking wine to puns (plenty of puns) to romantic sayings and funny thoughts, these wine-centered Instagram captions will say it all when you’d rather be sipping than thinking up a clever caption. They work well regardless of what type of wine you’re drinking, whether it’s a vintage or comes from a box (no judgment, boxed wine has come a long way) if you’re on a picnic in a vineyard or on your couch in PJs. Read on for Instagram captions for drinking wine that will age like a fine bottle. A clever Instagram caption for drinking wine may get you more engagement, or it may just show that you’re very punny and a little tipsy. Either way, you’re having a great time and you know your friends love to see it.   This article was originally published on Sep. 11, 2022
