 A PEO is a type of company that provides HR-related services to businesses, such as payroll, benefits and risk management. PEOs allow businesses to outsource these tasks and focus on their core operations. PEOs are often used by small and medium-sized businesses that may not have the resources or expertise to manage these tasks in-house. They can help businesses save time and money by handling HR tasks efficiently and effectively and can also provide access to a wider range of benefits and resources than the business might be able to afford on its own, such as health insurance. PEOs work by entering into a co-employment relationship with the businesses they serve. This means that the PEO becomes the employer of record for tax and compliance purposes, while the business retains control over its day-to-day operations and decision-making. The PEO handles HR tasks, such as payroll, benefits and workers’ compensation, and provides support and resources to help the business manage its employees. PEO, HRO and ASO are all acronyms that refer to different services that businesses can use to outsource HR tasks. Which type of service is best for a particular business will depend on its needs and goals. PEOs can be a good choice for businesses that want a comprehensive solution that includes a wide range of HR-related services, as well as support and resources to help them manage their employees. HRO and ASO may be more suitable for businesses that only need to outsource certain HR tasks or want more control over their HR functions. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on the specific needs and goals of the business. Here is a brief overview of each: PEO A PEO is a company that provides a range of HR-related services to businesses, such as payroll, benefits and risk management. PEOs allow businesses to outsource these tasks and focus on their core operations. PEOs work by entering into a co-employment relationship with the businesses they serve, which means that the PEO becomes the employer of record for tax and compliance purposes while the business retains control over its day-to-day operations and decision-making. HR Outsourcing (HRO) HRO is the practice of outsourcing HR tasks to a third-party provider. HRO can include a wide range of services, from payroll and benefits administration to recruiting and training. HRO providers rarely assume co-employment responsibilities and do not become the employer of record for tax and compliance purposes. Administrative Services Only (ASO) ASO refers to a type of outsourcing arrangement in which a business contracts with a third-party provider to handle certain administrative tasks, such as payroll, benefits and HR compliance. ASO providers do not assume co-employment responsibilities and do not become the employer of record for tax and compliance purposes. A certified PEO (CPEO) is a PEO that has been certified by the IRS. To become a CPEO, a PEO must meet certain requirements, including: The CPEO certification is designed to give businesses confidence that they are working with a reputable and trustworthy PEO that has the necessary resources and capabilities to handle their HR-related tasks effectively. It is important to note that not all PEOs are CPEOs, and businesses should research carefully any PEO they are considering working with to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations. To choose a PEO, you should assess your business’s needs and compare pricing, features and contracts of different PEOs. You should also review the technology and user experience of potential PEOs, consider whether they specialize in your industry, check their accreditations and discuss any additional costs with their sales representatives before committing. To get a sense of the experience of current customers, you can read customer reviews. It is also helpful to demo the software, as PEOs are co-employers and more than just a software service. When making your decision, prioritize PEOs that offer the features your business needs and have an excellent reputation for user experience and customer support. Here are some essential PEO services that businesses might consider when working with a PEO: These are just a few examples of the types of services that a PEO might offer. The specific services provided can vary from one PEO to another, so it’s important to carefully review the offerings of any PEO you’re considering working with to ensure that it meets the needs of your business. Professional employer organizations (PEOs) may hold various certifications and accreditations that demonstrate their expertise and knowledge in specific areas. Some examples of certifications and accreditations that a PEO might have include: Some examples of technologies that a PEO might offer include: When choosing a PEO, it can be helpful to consider whether the PEO has experience working with businesses in your industry. A PEO that has experience working with businesses such as yours may be more familiar with the specific HR and employment needs of your industry and may be better equipped to provide relevant services and support. In addition to considering the industry experience of a PEO, it can also be helpful to review customer reviews and ask for references from businesses that have worked with the PEO. Customer reviews can provide insight into the experience of businesses that have used the PEO’s services and can help you get a sense of the PEO’s reputation. Asking for references from businesses that have worked with the PEO can also be a helpful way to learn more about the PEO’s services and capabilities. When evaluating the industry experience and reputation of a PEO, it is important to consider both positive and negative reviews and to look for patterns in the feedback that you receive. This can help you get a well-rounded understanding of the PEO’s capabilities and whether it is likely to be a good fit for your business.

At the same time, there are also potential disadvantages to consider. PEOs typically charge a flat monthly fee or a percentage of your payroll. These costs can vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the size of the business, the number of employees, the services being provided and the specific needs of the business. PEO plans are typically structured on a per-employee, per-month basis, with businesses paying a fee for each employee that is enrolled in the plan. The fee may cover a variety of HR and employment services, such as payroll processing, benefits administration and compliance with employment laws. Factors that can impact the cost of a PEO include: There are a few ways that a business may be able to reduce the cost of a PEO: To come up with the best PEO for small business, Forbes Advisor considered dozens of PEO services across hundreds of data points. Our editorial team narrowed down the list to the 10 best based on our methodology, which includes factors such as pricing, features, customer satisfaction and integrations. Each data point receives a weighted score, which is then totaled to determine the final ranking. We also evaluated each PEO service on its own merits, taking into account factors such as payroll services, employee benefits, HR management features and compliance assistance. We also considered whether the PEO offers any additional features that would be beneficial for small businesses, such as payroll funding or an employee assistance program. For pricing, the most important factor we considered was whether a service’s pricing was transparent or not, which most do not offer, meaning that you had to contact the company to receive a quote for PEO services. We also would have given bonus points to providers who offered free trials or versions of their product, but none of the providers on our list did so. As a result, pricing only accounted for 5% of our weighted scoring. The available features played a significant role in our choosing the best PEO services. The features we looked for in a PEO service for small businesses included benefits management, compliance functionality, flexible pay schedules, global payroll offerings, IRS and/or ESAC services, pay runs and third-party software integrations. We also weighted these features by whether they were included automatically with the service or whether they needed to be purchased separately as an add-on. We weighted features at 45% of our total score. We considered customer satisfaction with a PEO service to be essential as well and turned to third-party sites like G2, Capterra and the Better Business Bureau to look at reviews left by real users of each service. We considered the number of reviews left for each provider, looking for a threshold of at least 300 as well as how many reviews they had on Capterra and G2 that were 3.5 or higher out of 5. For the BBB, we looked for providers who had an accreditation of at least a B- and were accredited by the organization. These reviews accounted for 10% of the total score. Our final criteria were based on our market research and the categories listed above as looked at categories that included ease of use, detailed or stand-out features, popularity and value for the money. This final criterion made up 40% of the total score.  A PEO can provide a variety of services, including payroll, employee benefits, compliance assistance and employee training. PEOs are ideal for SMBs that wish to outsource their HR tasks. Whether you’re in real estate, retail, engineering, healthcare, law, accounting, manufacturing, information technology (IT), wholesale or any other industry, a PEO is worth considering. PEOs offer access to HR and employment expertise, cost savings, improved employee retention, risk management and simplified HR management to businesses. PEOs can also provide access to a range of HR and employment expertise, such as payroll processing, benefits administration and compliance with employment laws. By outsourcing HR and employment tasks to a PEO, businesses can simplify their HR management and free up time to focus on other areas of the business. Whether a PEO is worth it for a business will depend on the specific needs and goals of the business as well as the services being offered by the PEO. PEOs can offer a range of benefits to businesses, such as access to expertise, cost savings, improved employee retention, risk management and simplified HR management. However, it is important for businesses to carefully consider the potential advantages and disadvantages of working with a PEO before making a decision. Implementing a PEO includes assessing the needs of your business, selecting your PEO, signing an agreement and then implementing the PEO’s services. Typically, this involves training employees on the PEO’s systems as well as transitioning in-house HR and employment tasks to the PEO. Professional employer organizations may offer recruiting services as part of their HR and employment support. These services can include assistance with job postings, candidate sourcing and onboarding new hires. Some PEOs may also specialize in specific areas such as talent management or employee development. A PEO offers a range of HR and employment support to businesses, including payroll processing. A payroll service is a company that specializes in providing payroll processing services. PEOs offer a wider range of HR and employment support, while payroll services are focused specifically on payroll processing.
