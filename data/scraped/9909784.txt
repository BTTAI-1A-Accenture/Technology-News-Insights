Despite only launching the presale a few months ago, the project has already been able to raise a whopping more than $1 million dollars, with investors buzzing about the in-development web3 platform’s ability to fundamentally transform remote freelance work forever. Amazing News, DeeLancers!👨‍💻 We have reached another big milestone, raised over $1 Million in our presale!🙌🎉 Let's keep the momentum going! 🚀💪 Grab your $DLANCE today before the next price increase! ⬇️⏳https://t.co/XHnTqVzMLN#Crypto #cryptocoin #altcoin pic.twitter.com/XoJL9ECRuN — DeeLance (@deelance_com) May 23, 2023  At present, the remote freelance industry remains heavily dominated by centralized web2 middlemen like Upwork and Fiverr. These platforms wield enormous control over the freelance market and charge exorbitant fees, which comes at the detriment of both freelancers and employers alike. But by harnessing the power of the decentralized and transparent blockchain, web3 projects like DeeLance hope to remove the middleman and hand the power back to the people who count – the freelancers and the buyers of their work. And investors have no time to lose if they want to secure $DLANCE tokens on the cheap. When the presale hits $1.2 million, the price of $DLANCE is set to jump 15% from $0.033 to $0.038. Given the current pace at which $DLANCE tokens have been flying off of the shelves, that benchmark could be hit in the next few days. Those who get in now will be sat on a paper gain of around 73% when $DLANCE lists across major cryptocurrency exchanges at $0.057 in Q3 this year.
