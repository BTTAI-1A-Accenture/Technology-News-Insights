 Notion is free project management software with an API, making it easy to build custom integrations. It’s simple to use and comes with features such as bulk export, real-time collaboration, Kanban boards, timeline views, more than 50 templates and unlimited pages and blocks. Users can collaborate with up to five guests, and file uploads have a 5MB limit. Its page history is seven days, which is more than ClickUp’s one day of history, but less than Airtable’s two weeks of history. And while its free plan is only for individuals, you can invite up to 10 guests. We like that we were also able to use Notion to create internal documentation and make each page as unique as needed with blocks to build precisely what we envisioned.

 MeisterTask is primarily a task management tool that includes lots of features to qualify it as a collaborative and project management software. The free plan is generous with advanced features but limited in how much you can do without upgrading. You can add as many members as you’d like to your account, but you can only create up to three projects at a time. The time-tracking feature adds a timer to each task that appears on the top-right corner of a task window. We found it easy to get in the habit of recording our time with each task (and it continues to run and show the timer on the project board if you click off the task). One of the standout features of MeisterTask is the ability to create tasks via email. Simply email your tasks to a specific email address for your MeisterTask account and the app will automatically turn your email subject line into a task and add it to your list (the body of your email will appear in the description for your task). Who should use it: MeisterTask is a good pick for individuals who want to track tasks and the time they spend on each task. The email task creation tool is a helpful feature if you prefer to assign yourself or others tasks via email. Mobile App  Yes

 Height offers a feature-packed free plan that easily competes with the best project management software available. There are no limits to users, guests or tasks on the free plan and you get all views such as Kanban, list, calendar and Gantt chart. The main reason to choose Height is for its AI-assisted task management. As you chat with other users or create tasks, the AI offers suggestions to help you make the best choices for assignees, descriptions and updates. The app also includes real-time chat, integrations and automations. The limiting factors are in how many automations you’re allowed per month, the number of automations you can create and how long your search history lives. Otherwise, the most noticeable omissions from the free plan come in the form of security features, such as single sign-on, activity logs and domain restrictions, which are allowed only on the Business and Enterprise paid plans. Who should use it: Height is a great project management tool for those who want to use AI to help fill in gaps in task creation, organization and assignments. Mobile App  Yes

 Hive offers a lot of features in its free plan to help you create, assign, track and manage tasks in multiple projects. Its standout features on the free plan include task dependencies, milestones and a project overview, making it possible to schedule projects. You can also set up recurring tasks, use story points and automate some workflows. As much as Hive offers in its free plan, it also limits use in a lot of ways. There’s next to no customization, only basic reports are allowed, Gantt chart, calendar and table views are limited to 100 uses, and you can only integrate Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar. Who should use it: If you’re looking for a free project management app to use for project scheduling, Hive could be a good option for you. Mobile App  Yes

At its core, Miro is a visual collaboration app where you and your team can work on a whiteboard together for mind mapping, brainstorming and product planning. There are hundreds of templates available you can use to jump-start a project, an idea, a project charter or an event. The free plan allows you to integrate with any of the more than 100 apps. You can also create up to five “talktracks,” which are audio or video recordings you can add to a board to help with communication. Who should use it: Miro is great for those who prefer a more visual way of managing projects.

 Even some of the best task management software don’t include milestones, task dependencies and built-in team chat on their free plans like Nifty does. Nifty also allows recurring tasks and milestone dependencies, which makes project management from a broad view easier. A lot of Nifty’s best features are locked behind paid plans such as proofing, automations and custom fields. Its free plan’s storage space is limited to 100MB, and you only get two projects, so it’s best used for simple one-off projects. Who should use it: Nifty is a good place to start for a free simple task management solution, so it’s ideal for entrepreneurs and small teams that don’t have a large portfolio yet. Mobile App  Yes

 One of the best reasons to choose Microsoft Planner for project management is if you’re already using Microsoft 365 because it’s free as part of a bundle (and you can’t subscribe to Planner as a stand-alone app anyway). The suite of tools is easy to use if you’re looking for task management. You can easily assign tasks to multiple people and switch between Kanban, grid, calendar and chart views of a project. Although Microsoft Planner is intuitive to use, we found its organization of tasks didn’t always make sense. Tasks aren’t arranged by date, name or status in the grid view, and you can’t drag and drop to rearrange tasks. It’s also worth noting that customer support can be difficult to contact in a timely manner, which you can read about in our review. Learn more: Read our full Microsoft Planner review. Who should use it: To be clear, Microsoft Planner is only free to use if you or your business already subscribe to Microsoft 365, which is why we only suggest it if you’re already a Microsoft 365 user. 
 There are a few things to consider when choosing free project management software. The first is to decide which features are most important for your business. Another thing to consider is ease of use. Some project management software can be complex, so it’s important to choose a product that is simple to use. Additionally, consider the integrations available and the compatibility with your devices. Most free project management software offer the following features: Look for project management software that’s convenient for the whole team. Your software should help them keep everything in order, communicate properly and not miss project deadlines. Consider these features to simplify your projects: Integrations and device compatibility are essential factors to consider when choosing project management software. Some key questions to ask include: Free solutions often provide basic features such as task management, file sharing and free project plan templates, but may lack more advanced capabilities such as customizable reporting or integrations with other tools. In contrast, paid solutions typically offer more advanced features, dedicated support and better security, making them more suitable for larger teams or more complex projects. Free solutions work great for small teams or simple projects with limited scope, while paid solutions are better for larger teams or projects that need more advanced features. Paid solutions offer greater predictability and reliability due to their more robust support and security features. If a company has outgrown the capabilities of its free solution or needs more advanced features or integrations, upgrading to a paid solution may be necessary.

Advanced features needed for effective project management include budgeting, resource allocation, task integration, reporting and analysis, which allow even complex projects to be managed more easily. When evaluating the best free project management software available, we considered a variety of factors such as pricing, general features, additional features, reviews and recognition, and expert opinion. That depends on the needs of your business. If you need to track tasks, manage files or collaborate with team members, then you may benefit from using project management software. Free project management software is really free. However, some free plans may have limited features. The software may encourage you to upgrade to a paid plan to unlock advanced capabilities or add more users. Companies should choose the best project management software based on their needs and budget. However, monday.com is a very popular project management software among small businesses for its breadth of features, price and available free version. monday.com offers a flexible platform for brainstorming and collaborating on projects in real time, with a free plan that allows for up to two seats, three boards, 1,000 tasks, and unlimited projects and subtasks.
