Source: Gillette. Remember the Razer razor that was part of the gaming peripheral brand’s April Fool’s shenanigans? While the name fits, it was obviously not a real thing due to its flawed design and resulting impracticality. That being said, perhaps there have been enough people who liked the idea and willed it into existence, as there is now a real Razer razor that’s much simpler, and made by Gillette. And it’s called the GilletteLabs Razer Limited Edition. But by being simpler and more practical, it has also become a bit more boring. In this incarnation, it is simply a Razer branding and green colourway slapped onto a GilletteLabs with Exfoliating Bar razor, itself looking like an over-engineered ProGlide razor. In a press release sent to The Verge, Gillette says that this was actually inspired by the aforementioned April Fool’s joke by Razer. In a statement, the shaver brand also said that it’s more than just a logo slapped on top, but didn’t actually say what were the differences between the base and limited edition model. The report notes that the GilletteLabs Razer Limited Edition razor will be made available worldwide at the end of this month. There’s also the option to buy it with a green travel tin, as well as refill blades with the same green serpent theme. All that being said, I wouldn’t count on seeing these on our shores. It’s also up to you to decide which is the better novelty item between this and the reusable straw made by the gaming brand itself.
