If you've ever lied awake at night thinking about that one embarrassing thing you said several years ago, Olivia Rodrigo's “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl” is for you. The fifth song off the singer's new album Guts is cheeky and steeped in self-loathing and paranoia. Who can't relate? On her sophomore album, Rodrigo expands upon the angst and growing pains from Sour and turns them up to high volume. “Ballad” is a prime example, where she sings about FOMO, hating her clothes, laughing at the wrong time, Googling how to flirt, and falling for the wrong guys. “Everythin' I do is tragic / Every guy I like is gay / The morning after I panic / Oh God, what did I say?” she says in the second verse. The struggle is real, and so is the anxiety. Rodrigo wraps up these feelings with grungy guitars, bratty vocals, dark humor, and a very understandable exhaustion. Rodrigo told Zane Lowe in an Apple Music 1 interview about the themes she wrote about in Guts as a whole: “In hindsight, I think that a lot of this album is about the confusion that comes with becoming a young adult and figuring out your place in this world and figuring out who you want to be and who you want to hang out with and all of that stuff. I think that that's probably an experience that everyone has had in their life before, is just that rising from that disillusionment.” That doesn't just apply to young adults—grown adults will deeply feel it too.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others.
