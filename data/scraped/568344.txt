This broad discipline includes the development of business applications, network control systems, operating systems, middleware, video games and other types of software. If you’re considering a career in software development or engineering, you might wonder where the difference lies. The distinction between these professions can be murky, and the truth is that in many cases there is often no difference at all; job titles vary by workplace, and the duties that a software engineer performs at one company may fall under a software developer’s job description at another. The software engineering and development fields include various specializations, but one of the main delineations is between two broad subfields: systems engineering and application development. Application development tends to be a more client-focused field, emphasizing full-stack development for user-facing applications. Systems development primarily involves back-end development and focuses on building the systems and networks that run applications. Systems developers or engineers ensure that different software programs can function together on one platform and may be responsible for setting and maintaining an organization’s IT standards. Application developers design, build and test applications for consumer use, often collaborating with professionals such as graphic designers, user experience designers and product managers. The knowledge and skills needed for software engineering jobs vary by position, but below we list some important competencies for software engineering professionals. Are you wondering what coding languages to learn for your software engineering career? According to Stack Overflow’s 2023 developer survey, the most popular programming, scripting and markup languages among active software development and engineering professionals include JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Python and Typescript. As a software engineering professional, you may work from an office or from home, or you might travel to multiple locations. At times, you could work alone at your computer all day writing and testing code or designing applications. On other days, you might meet with collaborators, clients or other stakeholders to identify challenges and determine solutions. Your work environment depends largely on the job you have. Careers in software development and engineering involve understanding complex issues and providing even more complex solutions. Depending on the job, professionals may also spend lots of time alone at the computer; aspiring software engineers should be okay with a solitary work environment. Computer technology is constantly changing and improving, so choosing this type of career requires you to stay up to date on your skills. This may mean taking on additional coursework or training to learn new information. If you choose a software engineering career, prepare to keep learning. Independent learning, combined with a strong coding portfolio, may be enough to get your foot in the door. However, some employers prefer or require at least a bachelor’s degree, particularly for leadership positions. Education requirements vary, but most software engineering jobs require at least a bachelor’s in software engineering, computer science or a similar discipline. Some jobs demand a master’s degree in software engineering or a related subject. An undergraduate software engineering degree teaches you the fundamental technical skills required for many jobs, such as coding, database management, operating system management, application development and principles of cybersecurity. Master’s in software engineering programs further develops your knowledge and advanced skills so you can move into a higher-level management role. The curriculum may include cloud computing, software architecture and design, mobile applications, web frameworks, communication protocols, critical thinking and leadership. A 2023 survey from CoderPad found that 40% of tech recruiters regularly hire individuals with nontraditional educational backgrounds, such as software engineering bootcamps, massive open online courses or self-study. Another 40% rarely—but sometimes—recruit these candidates, and only about 20% of recruiters stated that they never hire applicants from nonacademic backgrounds. While not as comprehensive as traditional degree programs, coding bootcamps provide condensed, targeted training in key software engineering competencies. This can be an effective route to a software engineering career, especially for those who already have a bachelor’s in another discipline and don’t want to go back to school for another four-year degree.
