Filed under: Prefecture Japanese Steakhouse opens June 23 and it’s offering a wagyu steak omakase Prefecture Japanese Steakhouse opens Friday, June 23, taking over the former Restaurant Eugene space on Peachtree Road in Buckhead. And the restaurant is apparently bringing Atlanta its “first omakase steak experience.”  Backed by the team behind Okiboru Tsukemen and Ramen and chef Sean Park of sushi restaurant NoriFish, Prefecture offers a tasting menu featuring cuts of wagyu beef prepared in a variety of ways. (Think courses of Zabuton chuck center with Fuji apple ponzu, garlic oil, crispy shallots, and chives, New York strip aburi with caviar and chips, and a truffle wagyu slider for $175 per person.)  Beyond the meaty omakase experience, Park’s menu at Prefecture also features a la carte dishes of wagyu beef, pork belly, and fresh fish flow in from ports around the world, as well as sushi and sashimi. Expect wine, beer, cocktails, and a selection of premium sakes from Japan from the bar.  Prefecture Japanese Steakhouse joins a location of Okiboru Tsukemen and Ramen at the Aramore condo complex on Peachtree. Okiboru took over the former Karma Farm space there last year, which was also once home to Holeman and Finch Public House. After closing in 2020 at the Aramore, chef Linton Hopkins and Gina Hopkins reopened Holeman and Finch in February at Colony Square in Midtown.  Take a look at the opening omakase menu for Prefecture Japanese Steakhouse: Open Tuesday - Saturday, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 2277 Peachtree Road, Atlanta. prefectureatl.com.  Sign up for our newsletter.
