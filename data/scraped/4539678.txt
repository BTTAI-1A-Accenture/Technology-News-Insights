Ted Cruz (R-Texas) bought $1,600 worth of books from retailer Books-A-Million in December. Cruz’s latest book was published in October. When it debuted at No. 9 on the best-seller list, the New York Times noted that some book sellers reported receiving bulk orders.

The Justice Department discovered additional documents—including some with classified markings—at President Joe Biden’s Wilmington, Delaware home following a search of the property on last week, according to the president’s lawyer. Politics reporter Sara Dorn joins Brittany Lewis in “Forbes Newsroom” to discuss how this differs from the documents found at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. The Trump Organization will be relying on foreign labor to produce its Virginia wines once again. Trump Winery is looking to hire 35 temporary foreign workers to prune, thin and harvest grapes at its Charlottesville vineyard in 2023, according to a work order it filed with the Department of Labor earlier this month. The positions, which run from February to October, pay $14.16 an hour. Citizen and Immigration Services’ guidelines allow employers to retain temporary foreign workers if “there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified and available to do the temporary work.” The unemployment rate in Virginia, as of December, sat at 3%, which is low, but a slight uptick from previous months. Despite the former president’s repeated hostility towards foreign immigrants, his company has a history of relying on their labor, employing them at its clubs, golf courses and vineyard. Trump Winery has sought 29 to 35 foreign workers a year going back to at least 2018. Mar-a-Lago, a private club where the former president stored classified documents, sought to hire 91 foreigners to work as cooks, servers and housekeepers this winter. Trump’s West Palm Beach golf club, meanwhile, was looking for five temporary foreign workers to wait tables. As recently as 2019, Trump Winery also employed undocumented immigrants, according to the Washington Post. Spokespeople for the Trump Organization did not respond to inquiries.
