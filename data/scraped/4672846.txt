Pet waste is a big problem across the country from big cities to apartment complexes. Many dog owners blatantly ignore signs that say curb your dog or pick up after your pet. Now, there's a unique way of tracking down dog owners who refuse to pick up after their dog's poop. PooPrints is a DNA laboratory in Knoxville, Tennessee that specializes in dog poop. The lab processes 18,000 samples a month and generated more than $65 million in fines for their clients.
