In this piece, we will take a look at the top 25 regional bank stocks in the U.S. For more regional bank stocks, head on over to Top 5 Regional Bank Stocks in the U.S.  Due to the importance of money, the financial services sector is one of the most diversified and developed industries that you are likely to come across. There are several different kinds of banks and investment organizations that cater to the needs of different clients. Zooming in on the banking sector, retail banks are those that offer services to regular users and small businesses. They are smaller in size and have less stringent capital requirements. However, just because they offer retail services doesn’t mean that the banks have to be small. For example, some global behemoths with retail banking divisions are JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). These banks also provide corporate banking and investment management services, which end up overlapping their roles with those offered by mutual funds and hedge funds. However, hedge funds differ from the rest since most of their investments come through leverage. Imagine getting $100 in investor capital and using it to borrow $1,000 to invest. Moving down the ladder, we come across regional banks. These banks often operate in some regions of a country, as opposed to national banks that have a larger presence. The primary difference is in the form of an asset base – with regional banks generally having up to $100 billion in capital according to the Federal Reserve. These banks typically offer the same kinds of services to their customers as their larger peers, but also have the advantage of wider coverage within the region that they operate. For instance, it might be easier to find a Signature Bank ATM in Fayetteville, Arkansas, than a JPMorgan ATM. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), there were 4,750 community banks in the U.S. in 2019 – after dropping from the 6,802 banks in 2016. While community banks are generally thought to be smaller, the FDIC data set also includes those classified as regional on the stock market. The latest data from the government agency lists down 4,747 regional banks, with the largest in terms of assets after the big four JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), being U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) with a massive asset base of $591 billion.
