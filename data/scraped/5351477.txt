Helicopters are fighting the fire from the air. | Chloe Graham A forest fire in the Deya Valley was declared at 1.30pm on Friday by the Ibanat agency on its Twitter account. By mid-afternoon, Ibanat was reporting that the fire was Level One seriousness potential. At 6pm, with the same level applicable, Ibanat said that eight hectares of pine forest had been affected. An hour later, and the level was reduced to zero; the situation was described as stable. Three helicopters were sent to help fight the fire.  Warm temperatures and winds are not helping the efforts, nor is the damage to trees caused by Storm Juliette at the end of February and which hasn't yet been cleared.
