Strand Life Sciences, India's first College of Pathologists -accredited laboratory for genomics research and diagnostics, has introduced cutting-edge instrumentation for further automation and scaling. The newly added Illumina NovaSeq X Plus genome sequencer and Beckman Coulter's advanced Biomek i7 Automated Liquid Handler position Strand well for greater volumes and efficiency. The Illumina NovaSeq X Plus is the latest genome sequencer. It produces up to 16 Terabases of data in a single run at a lower cost per base than prior sequencing platforms. The Beckman Coulter Biomek i7 Automated Liquid Handler automates sample preparation and ensures repeatability. These new upgrades will enable Strand to offer doctors and patients even more reliable and cost-efficient sequencing diagnostics while meeting the increased demand for research and preventive testing. Commenting on the expansion, Dr. Ramesh Hariharan, CEO and Co-Founder, Strand Life Sciences, said, ''We are excited about the addition of Illumina's NovaSeq X Plus and Beckman Coulter's Biomek i7 platforms into our laboratory facility. This upgrade represents a significant step forward in the quest to make genome sequencing accessible to all in India.''
