FOLLOW DEVELOPING TELECOMS  Now Telecom parent company Now Corporation teamed up with US equipment vendor Celona to deliver private 5G networks to the enterprise sector in the Philippines. Now Corp said in a statement it signed an MoU with Celona, and it will expand its current broadband telecoms network by rolling out turnkey stand-alone (SA) private wireless networks specifically engineered for the enterprise market. Through the partnership, Now will target sectors seeking to tap into automation such as manufacturing, oil and natural gas, logistics and transportation. The operator added the private wireless LAN solutions will enable businesses to quickly deploy private wireless networks, built on cloud-first architecture. It will use Celona’s complete end-to-end portfolio of new NR products. “We view private wireless as the next technology to revolutionize the enterprise as digital transformation initiatives drive business transformation,” said Now Corp president and CEO, Henry Andrews Abes. “As a strategic offshore hub, the Philippines represents a massive opportunity to deliver innovative private wireless solutions at scale to what is effectively an untapped market. With a best-in-class private wireless network purposely architected for the enterprise, Celona is an ideal partner to help us capitalize on this opportunity.”
