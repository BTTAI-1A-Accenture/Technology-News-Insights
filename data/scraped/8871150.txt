 A Facebook post on Feb. 21 about the building blocks marketed as being compatible with Lego blocks has attracted a lot of attention.No dimensions were mentioned, but the completed toy altar containing the God of Wealth appears to be about 12cm to 15cm tall when placed in front of a stack of books.

 The Facebook post about the toy appears to be an affiliate marketing gimmick.  Clicking on the Shopee link (sans tracking code in URL) will lead to a merchant who listed the toy for sale at a price between RM258.56 (S$78.23) and RM713.61 (S$215.90).  But it can be bought for cheaper elsewhere.  A Singapore-focused Shopee merchant listed the toy for S$60.14 to S$75.28 only.  According to the Lazada listing (sans tracking code in URL) provided by the Facebook post, there are more than 350 block pieces in total to create the oblation table.
