Source: Carousel Time-critical logistics firm Carousel has added a new air cargo route between Germany and Ireland to meet growing demand. The service will operate between Hannover and Dublin and will utilise a nine-tonne payload aircraft, departing daily on Monday through to Friday from the German airport. The service will target automotive, construction, medical, equipment and e-commerce volumes and was developed following consultation with existing customers that “required the shortest possible time between order placement and delivery to the end customer”. Lars Ryssel, group chief solutions officer, Carousel said: “The additional growth delivered by this new route is exciting and we are in a good position to react swiftly if we need to increase capacity or frequency. “Our customers in the automotive and agricultural parts sector will benefit from this new route, as well as those in the medtech, construction, and materials handling equipment sectors. “Carousel is also making significant inroads into the e-commerce sector thanks to our ability to offer extremely attractive late cut-off times, and we look forward to developing these opportunities.” Carousel said it would also invest in additional operational sites at Dublin airport.
