But while many cash advance apps and money loaning apps offer fee-free services, others charge monthly fees and tips that can translate into extremely high annual percentage rates (APRs). The best loan apps provide convenient services without substantial added costs.

 Users can get cash advances up to $500 and the company reviews available funds before debiting the repayment amount. This prevents banking overdraft fees and adds to the overall value of the service. Dave also offers users Dave Spending accounts, which feature no overdraft or low-balance fees. The platform charges a $1 monthly fee, but tips are optional and can be as much as 20% of the advance. Users can pay $1.99 to $5.99 per transaction to receive funds within eight hours instead of several days. Repayment: Automatically set to the user’s next payday, but this is adjustable. APR example: Borrowing $100 five days before your next paycheck, with a $3.99 express fee, $1 monthly subscription fee and a $1 tip, will cost $5.99, which equates to an APR of about 437%. Turnaround time: Up to three days or within eight hours for users who pay the express fee. 
 Note: The APR calculations in this post are based on omnicalculator.com. Money loaning apps and cash advance apps offer fast funding times with minimal fees. Some even provide additional financial management resources like checking accounts, automatic overdraft protection and budgeting tools. If you need a little extra cash to tide you over until payday, these apps could help. But with so many options available, it can be tough to know which app best meets your needs. Follow these tips when comparing the best cash advance apps: A cash advance app is a type of mobile application that allows users to borrow money against their next paycheck. These loans typically come with high fees and interest rates, but they can help consumers access cash quickly or avoid their bank’s overdraft fees. Related: 10 Ways To Get Cash Now Cash advance apps typically work by allowing users to borrow money against their next paycheck. Some apps track work hours while others rely on monthly direct deposit history. In general, though, these apps require users to connect their personal bank account with the platform to allow for automatic payments and withdrawals. On the other hand, some cash advance apps are actually mobile banks that offer overdraft protection for account holders. In this case, the app helps users avoid overdraft fees by automatically depositing money if an overdraft is detected. The money is then withdrawn from the user’s account when their next paycheck is deposited. Notably, cash advance apps should only be used sparingly to borrow cash against future paychecks. Even tip-based apps can come with high APRs that can lead to a cycle of borrowing that only serves as a temporary fix. Cash advance apps can help consumers avoid overdraft fees and cover minor, unexpected expenses—but they’re just a bandaid, not a long term solution. Because of this, loan apps come with a number of advantages and disadvantages that should be considered before agreeing to the terms of use. Using a cash advance app may make sense if you need fast cash to cover an emergency expense, such as an unexpected car repair or medical bill. It’s often a more affordable option than a payday loan, but you could still end up with overdraft fees if you don’t have enough in your bank account to repay the funds.  While a cash advance app can be helpful, it isn’t a good solution for covering everyday expenses or other ongoing costs since the fees can quickly add up.  Cash advance apps can provide fast access to cash when you need it, but they usually come with high fees and interest rates, which can make them expensive in the long run. Consider these cash advance alternatives first: In contrast to cash advances, small personal loan amounts start around $1,000 to $2,000 and don’t require repayment as quickly. Instead, terms are often available for 24 months or more, and APRs start around 4% for borrowers with good credit. Related: Best Small Personal Loans Credit union personal loans offer a lower-cost alternative to cash advances but with lower borrowing amounts—usually around $250 or more. Credit unions are nonprofit organizations, so they typically offer lower rates and terms that are more favorable to borrowers. But keep in mind you’ll need to become a member of the credit union to take out a loan. If it’s an option, a family loan may be a good alternative to a cash advance. This is just a loan you borrow from a family member or trusted friend. The interest rate will likely be lower and you’ll have more flexibility around repayment terms. That said, you should create a repayment plan so you don’t put a strain on your relationship. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) apps let you finance purchases over a set period of time. Some BNPL apps don’t charge any interest if you pay off your purchase within the term, whereas others charge interest for longer repayment terms. With a BNPL service, you can immediately purchase an item and pay it off in weekly, bi-weekly or monthly installments. Aside from interest, you might have to pay fees for using BNPL if you miss payments.  There are also lots of other ways to get money fast besides taking on debt, including: We reviewed nine popular lenders based on eight data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, perks, customer experience and funding speed.

Banking services provided by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC.  *Chime SpotMe is an optional, no fee service that requires a single deposit of $200 or more in qualifying direct deposits to the Chime Checking Account each month.

Tipping or not tipping has no impact on your eligibility for SpotMe. Cash advance apps are a type of payday lender. Payday lenders offer short-term loans with high interest rates and fees, while cash advance apps typically work by allowing users to borrow money against their next paycheck. Like other payday lenders, these loans also usually come with high fees and interest rates. Related: Payday Loans Vs. Cash Advance Loans Several apps let you borrow money instantly, like Dave and MoneyLion, while others offer same- or next-day funding. That said, not all same-day loan apps are created equal, and some charge high fees or require users to sign up for an in-house checking account. So, always do your research before deciding on the right app for your situation. Cash advance apps often require users to provide personal financial information, connect a bank account or even provide their Social Security number. While many loan apps are safe to use, it’s important to read online reviews and choose a reputable app that takes security seriously. Each type of cash app sets its own rules for who qualifies to borrow money. For cash apps that offer short-term cash advances, you’ll typically need to use the app for your everyday banking activities and be signed up for direct deposit from your employer. That way, the next time you get paid, the app will automatically repay the short-term cash advance for you. Empower, Chime SpotMe and EarnIn are all possible options to borrow $100 or more. However, it’ll take time to set these up, and you may need to pay subscription fees or other charges for instant transfers. Cash advance apps are similar to loans since they offer cash upfront that you pay back at a future date. However, cash advance apps are lending money against your next paycheck and usually come with lower interest and fees than a payday loan, as long as you repay the advance on time. They typically offer smaller amounts than a typical loan and, unlike traditional personal loans, don’t often require a credit check.
