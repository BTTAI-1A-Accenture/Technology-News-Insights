Following official collaborations with BBC ICECREAM and Clarks, Vandy The Pink now readies a new Spring 2023 drop featuring his signature burger and fast food motifs. Highlighting the upcoming series are Varsity jackets designed by Kanagawa-based painter CHARR in both kids and adult sizing. The body arrives in light brown wool with white and yellow trim while the arms are featured in a PU leather blend with tufted Tokyo Tower and Coca-Cola patches. Cropped hoodies incorporating a snap button hood and an extra pocket for Airpods complete the apparel assortment. Accessories include silver-plated open rings and 12-inch burger plush toys, and rounding out the assortment are trainers inspired by vintage basketball sneakers. Vandy’s flower and globe icons are spread across the silhouette and a “Your Favorite since 2017” banner runs across the heel counter.
Take a closer look at the series above and head over to the Vandy Lab website to shop the collection. Prices range from $50 to $290 USD.
