SUPERMARKETS are choc full of Easter eggs. But in the face of “shrinkflation”, finding a bargain is no yolk. We recently revealed that Cadbury had shrunk some of its bestselling eggs including Wispa, Flake and Dairy Milk, with some small eggs being slashed from 122g to 96g and larger ones falling from 224g to 182.5g. But prices have remained the same or have even gone UP. Plus there is often a premium you pay for your chocolate if it comes in the shape of an egg. We cracked the case by comparing Easter treats with regular chocolate bars, bags and boxes. So if you need a little egg-stra help this Easter, follow my guide so you can find the sweetest deal. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.
