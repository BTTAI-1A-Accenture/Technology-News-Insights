SUDBURY, MA â€” A series of car thefts in Sudbury and Leominster led to a confrontation early Wednesday morning in Maynard between suspected thieves, local police are reporting.  The thieves were able to escape police on foot, sparking a region-wide search for up to 10 members of an organized car theft gang, Maynard police said.  Maynard police got involved in the thefts near 3:30 a.m. Wednesday when police responded to Christmas Motors along Acton Street for a report of someone stealing a car. "Upon arrival, officers observed several cars blocking the roadway, and vehicles leaving the area of Acton Street and Brown Street. One vehicle was observed driving down Route 27 and turning the wrong way onto Main Street. Officers activated their blue emergency lights and attempted to stop the apparently stolen vehicle," Maynard police said in a news release. The person driving in the wrong direction crashed, and then ran from police.  Police from Acton, Stow and Sudbury responded to help with a search, but did not find anyone. Police believe the man escaped due to weather conditions and terrain that slowed down the search. According to Maynard police, the car theft gang stole a BMW from Sudbury that was later found in Worcester. Two more cars were stolen in Leominster, and one was found in Fitchburg. Two cars were stolen in Maynard. Police believe the gang stole at least two other cars from Leominster. Local police are asking anyone with surveillance footage to contact Maynard police. Maynard police also released video of the confrontation between police and one suspect along Main Street. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
