UK intelligence has suggested that a small group of Wagner Private Military Company (PMC) instructors are involved in Belarusian military training near the Polish and Lithuanian borders. Source: UK Defence Intelligence review on 11 August, as reported by European Pravda Details: UK intelligence said the Belarusian Defence Ministry announced on 7 August the beginning of a training exercise conducted by the 6th Separate Guards Mechanised Brigade in Hrodna (Grodno) Oblast, an area bordering Poland and Lithuania. Quote: "The ministry said that the exercise intended to incorporate lessons learnt by the Russian military in Ukraine. There is a realistic possibility that the Belarussian troops will be joined by a small number of Wagner Group advisors acting in a training role," UK Defence Intelligence noted. UK intelligence added that this training looks like routine exercises planned by the Belarusian army, and it is unlikely that the formation is now deployed with the means necessary for taking part in combat missions. "However, Russia is almost certainly keen to promote Belarussian forces as posturing against NATO," UK Defence Intelligence added.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others.
