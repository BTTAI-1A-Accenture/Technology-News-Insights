This enables people to glean insights from data more easily and make data-driven decisions. By representing data in a visual form, data visualization makes data more accessible and easier to understand. There are many types of data visualization, but some common ones include bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, scatter plots, tree charts, polar graphs, radar polygon, mind maps, dichotomous keys, choropleth maps, timelines and project (or program) evaluation and review technique (PERT) charts. The most important factors to consider when choosing a data visualization tool include how easy it is to learn and use, if it offers access to several different graph and chart types―and that they’re easy to understand, even to beginners, that the tool allows you to export your data into different formats, that it can handle a number of different formats, is interactive, offers plugins and supports many different devices. It depends on who you ask. It offers many features for creating visuals, such as graphs, charts and maps. Excel data can also be imported into data visualization tools for further analysis. However, some data visualization experts consider Excel to be more of a data management tool than a data visualization tool.
