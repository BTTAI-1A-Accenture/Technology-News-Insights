May 13, 2023 By Gregory Bacon gbacon@observertoday.com A New York City real estate investment company has purchased an industrial building in Chautauqua County for millions of dollars.  The Post-Journal/OBSERVER have been looking at real estate sales in the county and recently looked at the sales from Dec. 16-30. During that time period, Lynn Development Inc. of Jamestown sold 2636 S. Work St., Ellicott to Falconer BDS, LLC of Great Neck, NY for $7.35 million.  According to Real Estate Weekly, an American real estate magazine primarily covering New York City, GreyHill Group, a commercial real estate investment company based in New York, is the company behind the LLC.  The magazine states the 401,000-square-foot industrial building is considered a multi-tenant building with two anchor tenants, Orbis Corporation and Keywell Metals. The property is also occupied by multiple smaller tenants.  “This acquisition is a major milestone for us because it nearly doubles GreyHill’s industrial square footage,” said Moshe Bloorian, GreyHill Group’s managing partner. “The transaction was an off-market acquisition secured through a long-term loan with a local lender. We also acquired the building at a highly desirable $18 per square foot.” In a separate sale, Samuel LaPorte and Thomas LaPorte sold part of 7521 Prospect Road, Westfield to R. Chadwick Land Holdings, LLC of Westfield for $600,000. This was the location of LaPorte Farm Equipment.  LaPorte Farm Equipment was acquired by Westfield Ag and Turf. A ribbon cutting took place on April 21. According to the company website, they offer a wide selection of new and used tractors, from lawn to large frame ag, as well as implements from Case IH, OXBO, Cub Cadet, Yanmar, Woods, and Maschio. They also offer parts and service.  In another sale, Jamestown’s Rental Properties, LLC of Jamestown sold 304-310 W. Third St., Jamestown to Structured Living LLC of Jamestown for $355,000.
