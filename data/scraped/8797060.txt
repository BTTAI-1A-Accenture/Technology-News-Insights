 My connection to Seekr I met Sheila, the founder and CEO of Basta, in 2021 and in our first conversation, we spoke about the product that would eventually become Seekr: a job search navigation tool for first-gen college graduates, grounded in data & practice from Basta’s seven years of supporting first-generation students get great first jobs. The value of Seekr immediately jumped off the page as I reflected on my career up until my chance meeting with Sheila, and especially on how it could have helped me arrive at the position I now find myself in – as Basta’s Director of Product building Seekr – much faster. Why did it take so long? Could I have avoided some of the misaligned jobs I had earlier in my career?   After graduating from college, I struggled to find jobs I was interested in. In retrospect, the primary culprits of this mismatch were lack of a clear direction and information overload. The combination paralyzed me and prevented me from taking a first step towards a career that was aligned with my qualifications and preferences. I certainly didn’t have TikTok, but even so, I was inundated with information – some of it useful, some of it not. For example, I was repeatedly told that a “good” resume was the golden ticket to a fulfilling career. With that advice ringing in my ears, I spent more time on crafting the perfect resume than actually learning about potential careers or talking to more experienced professionals in my network. I needed someone or something to be the arbiter for what was useful and what wasn't. Something rooted in data, not anecdotes, or worse, generic wisdom.  What sets Seekr apart? Seekr was compelling for me right away because it tackles the factors that paralyzed me by recommending a path to a fulfilling career, aligned with my specific interests and passions, and accelerates me towards that goal with a personalized job search plan. If the young people you work with feel the same job search paralysis I did, or worry about bowing to the economic or social pressures to accept just any job, even though they suspect it may be a dead-end, Seekr is the solution. It combines proven advice with just-in-time guidance, and students who take Seekr can expect the following core features: When peer organizations come to Basta looking to implement our career readiness model with their students, Seekr provides the foundation of our work together. In addition to what Seekr brings to individual students, partners receive digestible data insights, presented so they can quickly and accurately understand the needs of their student community. At Basta, we don’t believe in collecting data without sharing the learning back with the program directors, coaches and advisors we partner with to assist them in developing responsive educational interventions and programming. In short, Seekr makes personalized career guidance at scale possible.  Sharing Seekr for impact One of my proudest moments from working on Seekr is getting it into the hands of thousands of students though like-minded partners. We are currently working with 20 organizations from The City University of New York Futures in Finance, Bottom Line, Bloomberg and Blackstone LaunchPad. Our next ambition is to partner with more universities across the country so that students can - at any time of the day, in the comfort of their home or between two side hustles - plan for their post-college future and success. Stay tuned. In the meantime, to support students during the May-June peak hiring season, we are now offering free access to Seekr through organizations working with young people.
