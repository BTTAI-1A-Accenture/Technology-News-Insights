Deals, scams, your money, unemployment— Jeff’s newsletter cuts through the noise. Discount retail stores are popping up everywhere. If you’ve never stepped inside one, you may be surprised — the stuff there is on deep discount and it can save you major cash. A discount retailer is a store that sells brand-name items for up to 90% off. They get these products after purchasing them from major retailers. The items can be from overstocks, out-of-season holiday items, store returns, or extra inventory a big-box store doesn’t need anymore. So while you could go there and see the item for full price, these stores have them marked down. Rossen Reports visited Nunu’s Hot Bargains, where they sell items from Target, Walmart and Amazon. The stores restock their bins and shelves every single week. Then, as the week goes on, the prices drop every single day. This store stocks everything — clothes, shoes, pet supplies, books, toys, bikes, furniture, cosmetics, electronics, home goods, appliances, etc. Discount retail stores go by different names in every city. Simply, type “Discount retail stores near me” or “Discount bargain stores near me” in a search engine and many are bound to pop up. Some of the larger known ones include: Here’s a trick we learned while shopping at Nunu’s Hot Bargains. Take out your phone and download the Amazon and Target apps. On those apps, you can scan the barcode of an item to see what it’s selling for. On the Amazon app, the scanner is the camera icon located in the search bar. On the Target app, click “Discover” on the bottom and tap the barcode in the “Find items or offers” search bar. You can scan the item and see what retailers are charging for the merchandise.
