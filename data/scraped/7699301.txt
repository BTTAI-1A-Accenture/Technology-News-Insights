      Many factors were responsible for the company's growth trajectory.

     
      The company is popular for selling travel bags. Hence its business was impacted because of the lockdown. However, the travel sector boomed because of demand revival and an increase in consumers’ confidence.

     
      The demand for backpacks, ladies’ handbags, and school bags rebounded strongly as normalcy resumed and Safari was a big beneficiary.

     
      The management indicated growth was on account of an increase in domestic leisure travel, marriage season, corporate gifting, and gradual re-opening of schools and colleges.

     
      Going forward, the company may face some hurdles in the near term as Covid cases in China have started to rise. Resultantly, tourism and travel sectors will be negatively impacted.

      A growing order book in home furnishing segment, unique product offerings and impetus towards efficiencies in the medical segment, and steady demand trajectory in other verticals (auto, FMCG, lighting) would be the factors to watch out for.

     
      In the recent years, the company has successfully diversified into new streams like healthcare (drug delivery devices), carbon steel, toys etc, while keeping a healthy balance sheet. The healthcare division, that enjoys better margins, is expected to grow 2 to 3 times.

      To move in tandem with the financial results, the share price also rallied. The share price rally was fuelled by favourable market conditions.

     
      The rally continued for some time. However, with the beginning of 2022 and the onset of market correction, the share price fell. On a YTD basis the share price fell by 36%. Both of its businesses, corporate learning group (CLG) and skills and careers (SNC), have grown at a fast pace.

      After Ashish Kacholia bought a stake in PCBL, its share price hasn’t seen much of an upside. In fact, from March 2021 to 20 December 2022, PCBL share price fell by 27%

     
      In its latest quarterly results, PCBL reported a fall in profits, as higher costs offset robust sales of the tire strengthening material.

     
      A spike in crude oil prices following the Russia-Ukraine war and accompanying inflationary pressures have resulted in increased costs of production for carbon black.

     
      Thus despite increasing revenues, its profit fell because of a spike in the price of its raw materials.

     
      As soon as the international price of crude oil and petroleum products cool down, we could see an improvement in its quarterly profits.
