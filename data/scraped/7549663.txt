Updated: August 19, 2024 @ 1:17 am The Southeast Texas Regional Planning Commission (SETRPC) will meet on Wednesday, August 16th in Beaumont and among the items on the agenda will be considering the authorization of an agreement with Motorola Solutions, Inc. for new radios and a new communications tower for Jasper County. According to Jasper Mayor Anderson Land, the radio tower, if approved, would be constructed in the Roganville area and should help to improve communications in central and south Jasper County. Both agreements, if passed, would use grant funds to pay for them. Representing Jasper County on the SETRPC Board is Jasper County Judge Mark Allen, Jasper Mayor Anderson Land, Jasper Councilmember DeMarcus Holmes, Kirbyville Mayor Frank George, and Kirbyville Councilmember Amanda Gates.
