It’s been two decades since Ben Affleck played Matt Murdock in Fox’s Daredevil movie. The future Batman star also shot a cameo as the blind superhero in the film’s spin-off Elecktra, but that ended up on the cutting room floor. Since then the character has been played by Charlie Cox in the hit Netflix show and that version entered the MCU in Spider-Man: No Way Home before getting his own upcoming Disney+ show. But now Affleck’s original take on Daredevil is set to return to the big screen in the upcoming Deadpool 3, according to a new report. Ryan Reynolds’ first MCU movie as the Merc with a Mouth, following Disney’s acquisition of Fox, co-stars Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine and rumours have been abounding of cameos from other Fox Marvel movies.

Deadpool 3 leak – Hugh Jackman Wolverine film ‘very similar to Doctor Strange 2’  [DEADPOOL 3]   One of these would indeed be Affleck’s Daredevil, who according to multiple scoopers was asked by Marvel to reprise the role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness’ Illuminati scene. This didn’t come to pass, by now respected leaker CanWeGetSomeToast shared on TikTok: “Remember those rumours of Ben Affleck being on the set of Deadpool 3? Well they weren’t just rumours… The Devil of Hell’s Kitchen is back.” MyTimeToShineHello, another scooper, retweeted this suggesting they believe this rumour to be true too. In fact, earlier this year Giant Freakin Robot reported that Affleck’s Daredevil will feature in Avengers Secret Wars, the climatic multiverse Endgame coming out in 2027. This would make a lot of sense given that this is the rumour for fellow returning X-Men stars who are expected to feature in Deadpool 3 such as Sir Patrick Stewart’s Professor X and Sir Ian McKellen’s Magneto.

Read our Privacy Policy One of the big rumours around Deadpool 3’s plot is that it’s a time travel multiverse movie, much like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with hints of Loki. CanWeGetSomeToast previously shared on TikTok: “Wouldn’t be crazy if Deadpool 3 took Fox’s absolute disregard for continuity and used it as a plot?” The X-Men movie timeline is notoriously convoluted and inconsistent due to the time travel in X-Men: Days of Future Past and retconning of events in its prequel movies. So by the sounds of it, Deadpool 3 will involve the Fox universe characters including Affleck’s Daredevil (and perhaps even the original Fantastic Four) getting in trouble with the Time Variance Authority for meddling with the timeline, but then actually end up in the MCU. Well, that’s our best guess anyway. At least it’s now less than a year before the movie, which is expected to wrap in September, is released for us to find out. Deadpool 3 hits cinemas on May 3, 2024.
