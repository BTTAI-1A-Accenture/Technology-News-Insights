Anyone entering the St. Clair County Building in downtown Belleville will have to go through a metal detector beginning Monday. Previously, such security measures were reserved to courtrooms and St. Clair County Board meetings after visitors had entered the courthouse. But now the St. Clair County Public Building Commission has decided to set up a security checkpoint in the first-floor lobby to check everyone who enters the building at 10 Public Square. Scott Battoe, public safety director for the Public Building Commission, said there wasn’t a specific threat in St. Clair County that prompted the new policy but officials have taken into account the shootings that have occurred in public places around the country. Chief Circuit Judge Andrew Gleeson said officials with the state Supreme Court recommended the county expand its security procedures. “It’s just the right thing to do,” Gleeson said. The general public will not have to show any identification to enter the building, Battoe said. County employees must display their county identification card and attorneys will be asked to present their bar association card and driver’s license in order to go through a detector set up for employees and attorneys.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020.
