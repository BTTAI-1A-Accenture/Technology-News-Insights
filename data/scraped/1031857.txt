The AirPods (2nd Gen) are also available with either a regular charging case or a wireless charging case, with the price dependant on the option you choose. As this can all be a little bit confusing, we’ve compared each model below so you can choose the best pair for your needs. Best deal on AirPods Pro (2nd Gen): $54 off at Amazon Australia The AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) are the premium in-ear buds from Apple’s range, usually retailing for $399. While there’s little difference between the AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) in terms of design, the new generation comes with better audio capabilities and double the noise cancellation power.  The 2nd Gen buds also come with more ear tips included, so those with smaller ears can achieve a better fit. They boast up to six hours of listening time on their own (up from 4.5 hours on the originals) or up to 30 hours with the charging case (up from 24 hours on the originals). Best deal on AirPods Pro: on clearance at The Good Guys Similar to the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen), the original AirPods Pro buds retail for $399 – though you can usually find them online for less. Featuring shorter stems than the original AirPods, the Pros are more discrete in design and come in a shorter, wider charging case that is able to be charged wirelessly. Where the original AirPods took a one-size-fits-all approach, the Pros are more customisable – arriving with three soft, flexible silicone tips so you can easily find the best fit for your ears. They also come with voice-assistant Siri, active noise cancellation (so you can block out background noise), and a Transparency mode (so you can hear what’s going on around you).  Best deal on AirPods (3rd Gen) with MagSafe Charging Case: $22 off at Amazon Australia Best deal on AirPods (3rd Gen) with Lightning Charging: $2 off at Amazon Australia A hybrid between the original Apple AirPods and the Apple AirPods Pro, the Apple AirPods (3rd Gen) keep the shorter stem and water-resistant design of the Pros, but lack their active noise cancellation technology. They also have a new contoured design which Apple has said makes them “sit at just the right angle for comfort.” The pair provides up to six hours of battery life on their own, with listening time extended to more than 30-hours with the charging case. The charging case is also wireless, which means it’s compatible with Qi-certified chargers. Like the rest of the AirPods line, the pair also have Siri built-in for hands-free use. Retailing for $279, the AirPods (3rd Gen) are $120 cheaper than the AirPods Pro, making them a more budget-friendly option for those who don’t need active noise cancellation. Best deal on AirPods (2nd Gen) with Charging Case: $41 off at Amazon Australia Best deal on AirPods (2nd Gen) with Wireless Charging Case: No current deals. Apple’s AirPods (2nd Gen) are among the most popular in-ear headphones on the market and it isn’t hard to see why. The simple-yet-stylish buds have a unique, universal design that makes them comfortable to wear for most people. They also come with voice-assistant Siri, so you can use them completely hands-free. Like the AirPods (3rd Gen), the 2nd Gen buds do not come with active noise cancellation. On their own, the battery life of the pair lasts for around five hours but, with either charging case, this can be bumped up to more than 24 hours. The AirPods (2nd Gen) are available in two options – with a regular charging case or with a wireless charging case. A pair with the regular charging case will set you back $249, while a pair with the wireless charging case (which can be charged with a compatible wireless charging pad) are priced at $319.  Best deal on AirPods Max – $172 off at Amazon Australia (Sky Blue) Available in five stylish colourways, the AirPods Max are the first over-ear headphones from Apple’s own line up. Boasting a 4.5 out of 5 star customer rating on Google Reviews, the AirPods Max are some of the best noise-cancelling headphones currently on the market, and are also lightweight and comfortable to wear thanks to their breathable mesh ear cushion design. Similar to the AirPods Pro, the AirPods Max also feature a Transparency Mode, which allows you to hear what’s happening around you – a handy addition for when you’re waiting for public transport or walking down the street. On the downside, they do come at the extremely premium price of $899, so we recommend waiting for a decent sale before adding them to cart.
