  Wellnotes updates you on Wellinks and our work in COPD care. Why it Matters. Despite taking the breath away from 25 million Americans, being a leading cause of death by chronic disease, and one of the costliest chronic diseases, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is still under-resourced and overlooked. Wellinks is committed to sparking new conversations, creating a community, and becoming a trusted hub and partner for all things COPD.  New Here? Welcome! Here's a bit about us:  Back Again? Great! Here's some news:  Go Deeper: Keep reading to get the details behind everything above, meet the team, hear what we’re reading, and more. You can also reach us at ask@wellinks.com to ask questions, book a discovery call, and everything in between.  We hope that sharing our thoughts on these important topics will advance more discussions and progress. We look forward to sharing more exciting updates in the New Year and hope that you have a happy and healthy holiday season!  To celebrate COPD Awareness Month in November, COPD expert Dr. Chris Mosher and seasoned health plan leader Patrick Sturdivant joined Wellinks’ Director of Product Marketing Pooja Doshi for an AHIP webinar. They discussed the perils of fragmentation in chronic disease care and how integrating virtual solutions can help bridge gaps. Watch the session recording here. Wellinks’ President and Chief Commercial Officer Geoff Matous and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Abi Sundaramoorthy were featured on the Institute for Advancing Health Value’s Race To Value Podcast. They took a deep dive into why value-based care is so important for effective COPD care management. Listen to the full episode here. Earlier this month, Doug Wenners joined Wellinks as an independent director. Doug brings over 25 years of experience working with health plans and innovating health care delivery. Most recently, Doug founded, grew, and exited Prospero Health to Optum where he is currently CEO of the Optum at Home business. His experience also includes time as CEO at Privia, a now publicly traded physician enablement company, and sixteen years in senior leadership roles at Anthem.  Wellinks Study: The Lived Experience of People with COPD  In collaboration with the COPD Foundation, Wellinks conducted a survey to examine patient perspectives on COPD care in the United States. The survey engaged over 300 people and found that the status quo is failing those living with the disease. However, people with COPD are ready to embrace virtual-care solutions to supplement their current management plans. Read the full report here. Wellinks’ Chief Medical Officer Dr. Abi Sundaramoorthy also spoke on two panels at the Becker’s Health IT + Digital Health + RCM Annual Meeting. She shared her perspectives on partnership strategies for long-term financial stability, data transparency, and interoperability. You can watch a recording of her main-stage panel session here. In October, Wellinks’ President and Chief Commercial Officer Geoff Matous spoke on a panel with the Digital Medicine Society’s Smit Patel about how Medicare Advantage supports innovation in digital health and COPD care.   “We’ll help you with those clinical priorities that you have, but we’ll also help you prioritize what’s most important to you so that you can make the most out of your life. COPD might be a diagnosis, but it doesn’t need to be the definition of who you are."  Hear about how Support Coaches, like Arielle, work closely with Wellinks members to empower them to live fully and breathe freely.   PATH TO RECOVERY NEWSLETTER - LINKEDIN Geoff Matous – President and Chief Commercial Officer  “Beneath all the glitz and glam that comes with any Las Vegas trade event, the vibe at HLTH was that the music (even the Ludacris concert) will be stopping soon and there won’t be enough seats for everyone promising to ‘transform health care’. There’s an expectation that everyone creates more value from our health care dollars, especially for the patient, and successful organizations in our field will need to bring the change and the proof.”  YAHOO NEWS Ellen Su – Chief Product Officer  “Technology and digital health have presented an opportunity to extend care and make it more accessible to the people who need it most. This includes people with black and brown skin, people in rural areas, and people who have accessibility needs. We are continuing to build features and incorporate technologies that help us bring better care to more people.”  FIERCE HEALTHCARE Stephanie Willard – Clinical Operations Lead  “Long COVID is a chronic disease whose extensive impact is not fully understood at this time. Long COVID and COPD symptoms may present similarly, making it challenging to diagnose. It will be imperative for health plans to stay informed with the challenges that exist in these overlapping chronic diseases.”   AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE Arielle Polites – COPD Support Coach  “Anxiety and depression affect many individuals with COPD. It can be hard for folks living without COPD to understand how scary life with COPD can be; to be short of breath, to worry if your oxygen will last the car ride to the doctor, to wonder if you can afford your medications the next month. Our members face real obstacles and challenges, but with proper relaxation and breathing skills, referrals to mental health providers, and focus on movement and exercise, I have seen a real improvement in how members view their ability to cope.”
