 At Waynesburg University , you can earn a fully online master of education with a specialization in instructional technology. The 36-credit program takes one to two years to complete, with courses lasting eight weeks. Students in the instructional technology track have the option of pursuing an instructional technology specialist certification, which involves a practicum experience and additional courses focusing on content area teaching strategies and English language learning. Regardless of whether they opt for certification, all instructional technology students take courses in advanced multimedia, educational research, and curriculum development and instructional design. Waynesburg’s education department holds accreditation from the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Online learning is a popular option for many types of students, but it isn’t the right fit for everyone. Ask yourself a few key questions before committing to an online program. Distance learners often pay less for their degrees than their on-campus counterparts. Online students save on costs like housing and transportation, and some public universities allow out-of-state distance learners to pay in-state or otherwise discounted tuition rates. If you are a parent or need to work while pursuing your online master’s in educational technology, distance learning might provide a good fit. Many online programs provide 24/7 access to coursework and lectures and allow students to complete assignments around their schedules. Online students need discipline, organization and time management skills to succeed in relatively unstructured learning environments. If you prefer the additional accountability and support of a classroom and a peer group, in-person learning might provide a better fit. Institutional accreditation is administered by organizations overseen by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). These accrediting bodies evaluate the quality of schools’ programs, faculty, services and finances to determine accreditation status. You should only enroll at schools that hold institutional accreditation. Many employers, professional credentialing bodies and advanced degree programs do not recognize degrees from unaccredited schools. Plus, you must be enrolled at an accredited college or university to qualify for federal student aid. To find out whether a school is accredited, you can search for a dedicated accreditation page on its website or check CHEA’s database. Programmatic accreditation applies to specific departments and degrees within broader universities. While programmatic accreditation is not prevalent in educational technology, your chosen university’s school of education may be accredited by an organization like the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation or a state-specific accrediting body for education degree programs. An online master’s in educational technology is generally a good fit for classroom teachers who want to advance to instructional coordinator or coach roles. Given the prevalence of technology in today’s classrooms, master’s degree holders in ed tech may also be able to advance into administrative roles as principals or assistant principals. If you are a teacher who wants to leave the classroom but stay in education, an ed tech master’s might be the right fit. If you already hold a state teaching license, a master’s in educational technology can help you earn additional endorsements or credentials, such as state technology specialist certification. If you are looking to advance your career within your school or district, a master’s in ed tech could help you get where you want to be. Per-credit tuition rates for the 10 online master’s in educational technology programs in our guide range from $415 to $1,079. Over the course of a 30- to 36-credit master’s program, this translates to total tuition costs of approximately $12,500 to $40,000. According to the National Center of Education Statistics, the average annual tuition for a graduate program costs $19,749, which translates to nearly $40,000 for a two-year master’s program. In comparison, many of the ed tech master’s programs on our list are relatively affordable. To finance your education, consider filling out the Federal Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which can help you access federal loans, grants, scholarships and work-study programs. You can also seek out these opportunities through your prospective school and third-party organizations. A master of education focuses exclusively on the practice and theory of teaching and pedagogy, while a master of arts may provide a broader, more academic scope. Educational technology master’s degree holders can pursue careers as instructional coordinators or seek out administrative positions within school districts. Many of the programs in our guide take 18 to 24 months to finish. However, completion times can vary based on whether you enroll full time or part time.
