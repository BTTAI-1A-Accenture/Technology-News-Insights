In the crypto casino, many investors bet on the big names like bitcoin and Ethereum, but is Cardano the wildcard everyone underestimates? While early talks labelled Cardano as the next “Ethereum killer,” the project has since earned a reputation as one of the most divisive in the crypto space. Its journey has been marked by soaring peaks, challenging troughs, and an undeniable impact on the crypto market. When it comes to the project, questions remain: What’s next for Cardano? Is it poised for greatness, or will it fade into the shadows like so many projects before it? To shed light on the possible future of Cardano, we’ve turned to Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget, to provide her view of where Cardano stands today and where it might be headed in the near future.

No consumer protection. Capital at risk. In the competitive and crowded world of cryptocurrencies, Cardano stands out. Think of it as a new-generation blockchain designed to be more secure, scalable, and sustainable. The project was founded in 2014 and officially launched its native token ADA in 2017. Cardano offers a platform for building smart contracts (like digital agreements) and creating decentralised applications while claiming to be more secure and efficient than competitors.  Chen says that Cardano is alive with activity, with “135 projects launched and 1,264 projects in various stages of development” on the chain. However, she also adds that it’s not all smooth sailing, noting that “it’s clear that not all projects have flourished”. Regulatory scrutiny and significant advancements in layer 2 blockchain technology further threaten the progress of projects building on Cardano.  While Cardano was built to address the shortfalls of competitors like Ethereum, it has struggled to gain any significant level of adoption. Now that Layer 2 blockchain solutions have arrived on Ethereum, significantly decreasing transaction costs and increasing confirmation speed, Cardano’s once-unique features are no longer a significant catalyst for adoption. Despite this, Chen notes that “the foundation’s focus on development education, new infrastructure like stablecoins, programming languages, and wallets, and the growth of multi-chain solutions” set the tone for its ambitious future roadmap. A keen focus on next-gen tech, innovative digital coins, and user-centric solutions is at the forefront of this project. However, whether they can deliver on any promises is yet to be seen. Like many crypto projects, Cardano’s price history chart resembles the path of a theme park roller coaster: teetering highs, followed by precipitous drops.  In 2017, the Cardano blockchain and its native token, ADA, officially debuted in the crypto world at $US0.0024. ADA was originally greeted with scepticism. Chen recalls many detractors dismissing the project as just another “high market-cap sh*tcoin”. However, Cardano would soon defy these early judgments. “One of the pivotal moments for ADA was the Alonzo hard fork in 2021, which unlocked its smart contract capabilities,” says Chen. This technological leap and the 2021 crypto bull market set the stage for ADA’s meteoric rise. The enthusiasm and anticipation surrounding Cardano’s smart contracts led to ADA’s valuation surging by 30 times. Its market cap touched an impressive $US94.9 billion, which established ADA as a serious contender in the crypto race. “Such an ascent was distinct,” Chen says. “ADA, during this phase, even managed to outpace giants like BTC and ETH in growth rates.” Yet, with great crypto highs come inevitable corrections. Post the peak of the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021, ADA faced a downward shift. “After the Alonzo-driven peak, ADA’s price trajectory began oscillating, leading to the varied trends we observed in 2023,” Chen says. The final quarter of 2023 saw some life come back to the crypto markets, largely driven by the anticipation of the SEC’s approval of pending applications for spot bitcoin ETFs. All 11 applications were approved in early January 2024, sending bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs. You will now need roughly $105,000 Australian dollars to buy one bitcoin. While Cardano did not spike to the same magnitude, a rising tide lifts all boats, and ADA has been buoyed by the overall market enthusiasm surrounding the institutional acceptance of digital assets. As of June 8, 2024, ADA is trading at $US.43, around 50% higher than where it was in October just last year.  However, as the project has failed to gain traction against competitors like Ethereum, Solana and TON, Cardano has slipped out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies after holding its place for many years. Whether the project can reignite adoption and reactivate the once-strong community is yet to be seen. Analysing Cardano’s on-chain data provides key insights into its current activity. The total number of transactions has reached 91 million, averaging between 50,000 and 70,000 daily. This might seem impressive at first glance, but the differences become stark when placed side-by-side with Ethereum. Ethereum, being a significant player in the blockchain space, records daily transfers in the millions. In contrast, Cardano’s numbers, while growing, are still just a fraction of Ethereum’s daily activity.  Chen notes: “With bitcoin surpassing its all-time high, investors have high expectations for other prominent public blockchain projects in the crypto industry to also exceed their historical highs. Currently, Cardano’s price still has a 310% gap from its historical high.” One primary indicator of a project’s success is the number of developers working on the chain. The renewed sentiment around blockchain projects, such as Cardano, is spurring a surge in activity from developers, which can be seen in the number of new contracts being deployed exploding over the past month.  “The number of smart contracts on Cardano increased by 67% in just three weeks in March 2024, adding 9,671 new contracts, demonstrating the rapid growth and adoption of Cardano’s smart contract platform,” Chen says. “Additionally, Cardano has become the blockchain with the highest development activity during Q4 2023, surpassing other major crypto projects, including Polkadot, Kusama, Cosmos, and Ethereum. According to Santiment data, Cardano recorded 611.47 GitHub commits in the past 30 days, significantly ahead of Polkadot and Kusama.” Yet, challenges abound. Despite the fact that over 100 projects are already live and thousands more are in the development stages, only some ventures have found success. “The TVL (Total Value Locked) in Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem exceeded $450 million in March 2024, marking a 300% rise from last year,” Chen says. “The driving force behind this growth is the increased interest in other blockchain platforms, as investors seek diversified opportunities and higher returns.” Once again, compared to Ethereum, with a TVL of over $US53 billion, it highlights how far Cardano has to grow to compete. Chen is cautious when considering Cardano’s price potential. “In the short term, ADA’s potential to deviate from BTC’s prevailing trend seems restricted,” she says. “A resistance point near $US0.6 is evident.” Nevertheless, there are reasons to be optimistic. “Projects like Indigo and Minswap have witnessed significant growth in TVL, indicating healthy capital inflows and increasing investor confidence in the ecosystem’s potential.” Before we delve into the possibilities, let’s understand two essential market perspectives. The bull case is optimistic, highlighting scenarios where Cardano’s price could rise. In contrast, the bear case offers a more cautious stance, outlining why Cardano’s price might decline. These two contrasting views provide a balanced understanding of potential market trajectories for the project. Cardano is not without its strengths and opportunities. The Cardano Foundation has placed a significant focus on development education, creating innovative infrastructure, and expanding multi-chain solutions. These efforts cannot be understated. Chen is optimistic about certain facets of Cardano’s future: “Cardano’s reputation as an OG cryptocurrency project remains robust. The backing it receives from multiple entities and communities gives ADA a unique price elasticity.” Indeed, this collective support system can act as a springboard for ADA’s potential upward movement. Additionally, the almost cult-like group of supporters helps to push the project forward in the right direction. Half the battle for many projects is gaining a strong support base from avid users, and for Cardano, this is something that the project has no shortage of. Another question is whether the current level of support is enough to push the project back into the limelight. No coin, no matter how promising, is exempt from challenges. Despite Cardano’s concerted efforts in ecosystem development, it still faces obstacles. As highlighted by Chen, a concerning point is that “Cardano’s ecosystem is presently heavily reliant on its native token, and its user engagement and trading volumes remain moderate at best”. Furthermore, only some projects within the Cardano ecosystem have found success, with many failing to gain much traction. “For genuine, substantial growth, the network needs much more intensified operational efforts,” Chen says. The rise in popularity of layer 2 blockchains has made many of the lower-cost layer 1 blockchains, like Cardano, virtually redundant. The project must work hard to find its niche in the market among other blockchain projects. Additionally, uncertainties can’t be dismissed. Factors ranging from the overall development of the ecosystem, and regulatory decisions from bodies like the SEC, to broader macroeconomic conditions, all play pivotal roles in shaping ADA’s future.

No consumer protection. Capital at risk. Making a definitive judgement about an asset’s investment potential is always tricky, especially in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies. However, we can make an informed assessment based on the available data and expert perspectives. Chen adopts a measured stance on the future of ADA. She acknowledges Cardano’s robust background, its infrastructure, and the substantial growth in its staking activity. Yet, she also underscores the need for more intensified operational efforts for it to truly flourish. On the price front, Chen anticipates that “ADA will most likely fluctuate within the $US1 to $3 range”, however, she adds that a significant breakthrough in technological progress may drive its value back above $US1 for a sustained period. Like any investment, Cardano comes with its set of opportunities and challenges. Its status as an original cryptocurrency project, coupled with the strong support from its various entities and community, offers a sense of stability. Yet, uncertainties stemming from ecosystem development, regulatory environments, and global economic factors should be considered. For Australians considering Cardano as an investment, it’s always prudent to conduct thorough research, consult with a financial advisor, and approach it as a part of a diversified portfolio. As always, investments in the crypto space should be made with a clear understanding of the risks involved. This article is not an endorsement of any particular cryptocurrency, broker or exchange nor does it constitute a recommendation of cryptocurrency or CFDs as an investment class.  Cryptocurrency is unregulated in Australia and your capital is at risk. Trading in contracts for difference (CFDs) is riskier than conventional share trading, not suitable for the majority of investors, and includes the potential for partial or total loss of capital. You should always consider whether you can afford to lose your money before deciding to trade in CFDs or cryptocurrency, and seek advice from an authorised financial advisor. 
 It’s challenging to predict exact prices for any cryptocurrency, including Cardano, so far into the future. Many factors, including technological advancements, regulatory decisions, adoption rates, and broader market conditions will play roles in determining its price. It’s always wise to consult a range of predictions and do thorough research before making any investment decisions. For Cardano to reach $US100, its market capitalisation would need to be around $US3.5 trillion (which is $100 multiplied by its circulating supply of 35,045,020,830 ADA). For context, the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies combined was $US2.5 trillion as of March 21, 2024. This means that, for Cardano to reach $US100, it would be worth more than three times the entire current crypto market. While the crypto market can be unpredictable, reaching such a market cap for a single cryptocurrency would require significant global adoption and a major shift in the financial landscape. From a mathematical perspective, such a price would be a massive increase and, while not impossible, would be extremely ambitious. Predicting specific cryptocurrency prices five years into the future is a complex task due to the myriad of factors that can influence market dynamics. This includes technological updates, regulatory changes, macroeconomic factors, competition, and more. Historically, the crypto market has shown significant volatility. While some analysts and experts might provide price predictions based on certain models and data, it’s essential to approach such predictions with caution and base investment decisions on robust research. For Cardano’s ADA to reach $US20, its market capitalisation would have to be around $US700 billion (which is $US20 multiplied by its circulating supply of 35,045,020,830 ADA). When compared with Ethereum, with a current market cap of $US294 billion (23 Jan 2024), a price of $US20 would make Cardano worth 2 times more than Ethereum right now. This would depend on factors like widespread adoption, technological breakthroughs specific to Cardano, and a bullish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Mathematically speaking, it’s feasible, but it’s important to consider the broader crypto landscape, potential challenges, and evolving competition. When considering Cardano’s (ADA) future potential, it’s useful to compare it with Ethereum, a key competitor. As of March 21, 2024, Cardano is priced at $0.64 and has a market cap of $28.8 billion, while Ethereum stands at $3,500 and has a market cap of $420 billion. The substantial difference in market cap and price points to Ethereum’s current adoption and market share dominance. However, if Cardano can close the gap in technological advancements, increase adoption, and expand its ecosystem, there’s potential for growth in its value. This growth could be proportional to how it competes with Ethereum in key areas like smart contracts, DeFi applications, and scalability. The crypto market is dynamic and influenced by many factors, so while precise predictions are challenging, Cardano’s growth potential is closely tied to how it fares against competitors like Ethereum The recent surge in Cardano’s price, from approximately $0.25 in October 2023 to $0.64 as of March 21, 2024, illustrates a robust upward trend. This performance mirrors the general optimism seen across the cryptocurrency market, largely attributed to the approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs for trade in the US. Such regulatory milestones can significantly affect market sentiments, fostering a conducive environment for other cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA). While predicting the exact future price of Cardano involves uncertainty, several factors could potentially influence its trajectory positively. The huge increase in developer activity on the network is an extremely positive sign, as it is bringing a wave of fresh projects, and thus, opportunities. The chain is seeing significant capital inflows to projects like Indigo and Minswap, which is an indication of investor confidence in the projects being built on Cardano.  However, the chain is still a far cry from the likes of Ethereum or Solana, so while there is plenty of opportunity for growth, it is essential to dive deep into the details of the project to see if there are underlying reasons why it is lagging behind other blockchain projects. ADA and XRP, while both popular cryptocurrencies, serve different purposes. ADA is the native token of Cardano, a decentralised blockchain platform for smart contracts and dApps. It’s used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. In contrast, XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, a blockchain designed for fast, low-cost international payments, primarily designed for financial institutions to use as an alternative to traditional payment systems like SWIFT. ADA, Cardano’s native token, serves multiple roles within the Cardano ecosystem. Similar to how ETH works on the Ethereum blockchain, ADA is used to pay transaction fees, facilitate smart contract interactions, and reward network participants for validating transactions through staking. Additionally, holding ADA grants voting rights, allowing the community to participate in the governance and future development of the Cardano platform.
