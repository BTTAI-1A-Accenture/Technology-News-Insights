 We’re excited to announce that MetaRisk Labs, the developer of leading insurance protocol InsurAce, is integrating Chainlink CCIP—the industry standard for secure cross-chain interoperability. We’re leveraging CCIP’s Arbitrary Messaging capabilities to help facilitate cross-chain token transfers, enabling users to seamlessly interact and port tokens across all chains where our dApps are deployed. We selected CCIP as our go-to interoperability solution because Chainlink has a proven track record of maintaining the highest standard of security and reliability in the Web3 industry. Furthermore, CCIP is backed by the Risk Management Network—a separate, independent network that continually monitors and verifies cross-chain operations for suspicious activity. This additional layer of security is particularly important given historical industry exploits and the billions in user funds lost due to insecure and unreliable cross-chain infrastructure. MetaRisk Labs has launched several projects into the web3 space, most notably InsurAce which provides insurance to 180+ dApps across the multi-chain DeFi ecosystem. Having covered over $400M+ in value and paid out $13M+ in claims, InsurAce helps protocols manage various risks such as stablecoin depegs, bridging risks, custodian risks, and smart contract vulnerabilities. In order to enhance the range of InsurAce we’re integrating CCIP to help enable secure and reliable cover provision and transfers of tokens across the various chains we’re deployed on.  In order to help secure our cross-chain interactions, we needed access to a highly secure and reliable interoperability solution. After reviewing various solutions, we integrated Chainlink CCIP because it provides a multitude of important benefits and features, such as: Time-tested security and reliability—CCIP’s consensus and interoperability layer is powered by Chainlink decentralized oracle networks, which have already secured tens of billions of dollars for smart contracts and enabled over $8 trillion in on-chain transaction value. CCIP also features additional layers of protection and reliability via the Risk Management Network and Smart Execution. Seamless integration — CCIP offers a unified cross-chain developer experience by providing a single, easy-to-integrate interface. Developers only need to integrate the CCIP Router on-chain to start building secure cross-chain applications. Scalable architecture — CCIP eliminates the need for developers to write custom code for chain-specific integrations, while users can interact with any blockchain via a single interface. Future-proof—CCIP is built to support continuous updates, such as the integration of new blockchains, the introduction of advanced functionalities, and the addition of other defense-in-depth approaches to security. Thus,  integrating CCIP eliminates future switching costs should new cross-chain functionalities be required.  “Chainlink CCIP is the most secure cross-chain solution available and MetaRisk Labs is excited to be integrating it to underpin cross-chain interactions that will help to make DeFi safer for everyone. Not only is it easy to integrate, its future-proof design enables us to seamlessly scale if we deploy across additional chains.”  - Oliver Xie, Founder MetaRisk Labs About Chainlink Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.
