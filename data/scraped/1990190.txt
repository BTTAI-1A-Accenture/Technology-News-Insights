Lala Kent agrees with fans that Raquel Leviss showed zero emotion at the “Vanderpump Rules” reunion while dealing with the fallout of her affair with Tom Sandoval. After a TikTok user begged her to do an impression of Leviss “experiencing an emotion,” Kent happily obliged Thursday, sharing a video of herself staring to one side while appearing slightly confused. “I feel like I should’ve written her, like, a handwritten note or something,” the “Give Them Lala” author said while grinning, poking fun at the former beauty pageant queen’s off-set comment about her ex-friend Scheana Shay. “All of the repercussions are, like, starting to really …” Kent, 32, continued before starting to jolt her head back and forth and twitching her eyes like a malfunctioning robot. After “plugging” herself back in, she came back to life. “Where am I?” the newly charged reality star asked. Fans flocked to the comments section to applaud Kent’s impersonation of Leviss, 28, in the viral post. “Nailed it 😂,” one user wrote. “✨And the Oscar goes to✨,” someone else commented. “Omg perfection ! Brava! Are we sure she is human and not an AI robot?” another person wondered of Leviss. Kent was pointing out a scene in which Leviss watched Shay, 38, sob when host Andy Cohen handed her a letter stating the embattled cast member’s intention to drop a restraining order against the “Good as Gold” singer. Leviss — who was following the drama from a trailer parked 100 yards away because of the order — blankly stared at the live feed and smiled while wondering if she should have written Shay a letter. Kent’s video echoed several viewers’ concern for the way a stone-faced Leviss watched the aftermath of her affair with Sandoval, 40, go down during the taping. “It freaks me out how Raquel has ZERO emotions seeing this entire thing unfold in front of her,” a Bravo fan account tweeted. “No compassion or empathy? Like it’s legit scary how frigid and detached she seems.” “It kills me to see that almost everyone on the panel is crying, yet #Raquel sits there stone faced. Her lack of tears or ANY emotion speaks VOLUMES,” another user wrote. Leviss faced off against her co-stars and former friends — including Sandoval’s ex-girlfriend Ariana Madix — for the first time since Scandoval was exposed on March 3. Part three of the “Vanderpump Rules” reunion airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.
