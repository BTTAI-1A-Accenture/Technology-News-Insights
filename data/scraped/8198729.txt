THE Commission on Population and Development (Popcom) highly commends and supports Sen. Ana Theresia 'Risa' Hontiveros' sponsorship of Senate Bill (SB) 1979 under Committee Report 41 or the "Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancies Bill." Popcom considers this move of Senator Hontiveros, who is a staunch supporter of the country's established rights and advocacies on responsible parenthood and reproductive health (RPRH), as well as family planning — together with co-authors Senators Maria Imelda Josefa 'Imee' Marcos and Ramon 'Bong' Revilla Jr. who likewise filed similar bills, including Senators Juan Edgardo 'Sonny' Angara and Sherwin Gatchalian who have submitted resolutions associated with SB 1979 — a progressive step forward in addressing the national social emergency of early childbearing among Filipino adolescent girls.
