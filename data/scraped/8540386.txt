British information provider and events company Relx said it was on track to meet forecasts for profit and revenue to remain above historical trends in 2023 after reporting underlying revenue growth of 8% in the year to date. Relx, which provides data and analytics to help companies assess risk, as well as providing services to the medical and legal industries and organising conferences, said on Thursday that adjusted earnings per share would be higher this year. In its Risk unit, its biggest division by revenue, the company said growth was being helped by demand for financial crime compliance products and digital fraud and identity solutions. There had also been a jump in revenues from its exhibitions unit as demand for events and exhibitor use of Relx's digital tools continue to grow post-pandemic. Shares in Relx, created by the merger of Reed Business Information and Dutch firm Elsevier around 30 years ago, are up 26% this year, outperforming Britain's bluechip index which is up 2%.
