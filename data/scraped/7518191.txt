Image: ShutterstockA new app store for Web3 apps is in the making, as announced by the Web3 platform, Alchemy. The popular platform aims to make a decentralized app (DApp) store in order to provide both users and developers with a level playing field to develop and access Web3 apps. The development comes as news reports have emerged of a major app store charging high fees for recent updates of a prominent exchange.
								 
								Jason Shah, head of growth at Alchemy, claimed in a recent interview that though the new app store was a centralized one, it aimed to provide free resources to stakeholders of the Web3 community and provide free access to everyone, which would help in inclusive growth of the community.
