MIRAMAR, FL / ACCESSWIRE / December 27, 2022 / STEMTECH CORPORATION, (OTCQB:STEK) today announced that Stemtech's Taiwan Branch was honored by the Taiwan government agency which monitors the MLM businesses in Taiwan. Congratulations! Stemtech Corporation, Taiwan Branch, was praised by the Multi-Level Marketing Protection Foundation for its long-term, deep cultivation of the MLM industry in Taiwan. During the Multi-Level Marketing industry Summit forum held December 19th, our General Manager-Richard Hu took the stage to accept praise and adulation. He says "every year, more than 70 MLM companies are established, but there are also more than 70 disbanded. 90% of the organizations do not survive the first year. Such figures indicate that it is a very rare thing to become a firmly footed networking company in Taiwan. Stemtech has been licensed and operating in Taiwan for 14 years, among hundreds of MLM companies that come and go. We are standing in the top ten percent position in terms of duration! While operating in this challenging market, it also reflects the high degree of recognition of Stemtech's products and business opportunity that we have provided to Taiwan for so many years!" Stemtech Corporation Chief Executive Officer, Charles S. Arnold comments that "it is quite an honor to be lauded by this prestigious organization in Taiwan. It is a tribute to our General Manager Richard Hu and staff to be recognized in such a public forum as a leader in the industry. We are proud that Stemtech has been able to help people with our leading-edge, anti-aging, all-natural plant-based products as well as the business opportunity for nearly 15 years in Taiwan." Vice President of Global Sales, Alejandro Carrillo notes that "we are looking forward to build upon the business which Richard is leading in Taiwan. We have just discussed planning a Business Academy for Taiwan when we met together at the Stemtech Leadership Journey Event in Cancun, Mexico December 5 - 9th. Richard and I will be working closely together to grow our business even more, and to make this upcoming Business Academy a huge success for our Taiwan Branch in 2023." Stemtech Corporation President and Chief Operating Officer, John W. Meyer says "Taiwan represents a tremendous opportunity with the continued expansion as this market is highly advanced in the direct selling industry. In August Stemtech celebrated the grand opening of a second office in Kaohsiung City, established and owned by our inspirational Sapphire Director Independent Business Partner (IBP) Teresa Liu, who also recently attended the Cancun Leadership Event. We anticipate that our overall growth should reach new heights. New products are being planned for introduction in early 2023 in Taiwan and this is expected to further ignite the business. I can remember being at the opening ribbon-cutting ceremony in 2008 when we first opened our Taiwan office. I look forward to being there again next year for the planned Business Academy. Congratulations to Stemtech Taiwan Branch, we are so proud of you!"
