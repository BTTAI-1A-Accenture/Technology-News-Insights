Now the demand and supply in Jio Financial Services shares would get normalised based on events and performance data points on the business activities. Technically, I believe risky traders can look to Accumulate in -2 tranches up to 218 level,” explained Prashanth. According to Mohit Gulati, CIO & Managing Partner of ITI Growth Opportunities Fund, MSCI and FTSE indices will retain Jio Financial in the index without any impact on inflow or outflow; as long as they hold the fort the exclusion from Sensex wont hurt the stock. Also if price limits are met then NIFTY will also retain JFSL in the index. So only Sensex exclusion will be an isolated event.
