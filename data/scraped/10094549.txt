Despite being 54 percent below its all-time high, Bitcoin has still recorded a significant 86 percent gain year-to-date. Presently, the market sentiment appears balanced, with neither bulls nor bears dominating, as Bitcoin trades within the midrange of the support and resistance levels. If the price manages to sustain above the $31,000 range in the coming days, there is a possibility of Bitcoin surpassing the $32,000 mark in the near future. In the meantime, Ethereum is currently valued at the $1,940 level.” Shubham Hudda, Senior Manager, CoinSwitch Markets Desk, said, “The crypto market has observed a slight selling pressure in the last 24 hours, ending a two-day streak of registering positive price action. The global crypto market capitalisation, down 0.8 percent, currently stands at $1.25 trillion. The crypto fear and greed index also dipped by 3 points but remains within the greed zone with a score of 61/100.” Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, “The Crypto industry experienced a slight decrease in value following less market activity due to the 4th of July weekend. Liquidity crisis continues to be a challenge in the Crypto ecosystem even though Bitcoin futures surpasses its March 2023 highs." Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Several ETF issuers, including Fidelity, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco, have resubmitted their SEC filings and provided updated information about their partnership with Coinbase as a select crypto exchange. BTC hovers around $30,800 currently. Bitcoin is currently facing resistance around $31,000, but is holding just above it at $31,050. The presence of a bullish engulfing candle on the daily time frame indicates a strong possibility of a bullish trend. Resistance at $31,350 could lead to a target of $32,500 or even $34,150. Positive sentiment is indicated by technical indicators such as RSI and MACD, with the 50-day exponential moving average supporting an uptrend. Support levels are at $30,500 and $29,650, with a potential decline to $28,650 or $27,900 if $29,650 is breached. Monitoring the $31,000 level is key to identifying a potential buying trend.” Shivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, “The total crypto market volume over the last 24 hours is $29.53 billion, reflecting a significant decrease of 22.11 percent. Meanwhile, the volume in DeFi stands at $2.52 billion, accounting for 8.54 percent of the total crypto market's 24-hour volume. Amidst this market trend, Bitcoin has reached a price of $30,857.”  CoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, “The world's largest digital asset crossed the $31,000 mark, rising 2 percent from the previous day after a few prospective Bitcoin ETF issuers refiled their applications. The refiled applications came after the SEC rejected several spot bitcoin ETF applications in recent months. Meanwhile, Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) have begun to pick up momentum this month as the second half of the year edges closer toward a highly anticipated Ethereum upgrade. LST platforms and protocols like Lido and Rocketpool have so far accrued $20 billion in total value locked, representing around 10.3 million ETH.” Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
