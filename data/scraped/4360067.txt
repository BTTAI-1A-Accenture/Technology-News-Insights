Itâ€™s my version of a favouriteÂ school dinnerâ€™sÂ pudding. Big squares of chocolate sponge cake, always baked in a big roasting tin, were served with lashings of chocolate custard. It wasÂ the best puddingÂ ever on a wet, windy or coldÂ schoolÂ day, and the portions were always very generous too. Iâ€™ve not shared a recipe for 24 portions (or more!) of School Chocolate Sponge & Chocolate Custard today, just 9 large squares for your dining pleasure! This is a delightfully rich and light chocolate cake and it reheats well in the microwave.Â  You can serve it with Pink CustardÂ if you like, but we prefer a double chocolate whammy. The custard is unashamedly made withÂ Birdâ€™s Custard Powder,Â as Iâ€™m sure the school cooks made it, with added cocoa powder. And, as you can see from the photos, itâ€™s a lovely glossy and shiny custard, which goes perfectly with theÂ chocolateÂ sponge. This keeps well too, in the an airtight tin, and it can be eaten naked (the cake that is, not you!) if you prefer. Or why not add some chocolate icing or buttercream with someÂ hundreds and thousands, for a chocolate version of myÂ Retro School Dinner Iced Tray Bake Cake? I have shared this in July, which is of course summer in the Northern Hemisphere, as weâ€™ve been hit with some unseasonly cold and wet weather. But I think this is a year round pud, so please enjoy it whatever the season if you make it, and please do let me know if you enjoyed it.

Sue says  9 July 2023 at 8:22 am My favourite pud made it all the time when the kids were small.
 Custard is how I make it nice and thick though 
Karen Burns-Booth says  15 July 2023 at 8:22 am I do like a thicker custard or sauce! 
Julie O'Sullivan says  9 July 2023 at 12:05 pm When I was a kid, we were allowed to choose our favourite dinner on our birthday and this was always my choice of pudding. Except  we called it chocolate pudding and chocolate sauce. It would never have been made with custard powder because I have hated that all my life!!!
