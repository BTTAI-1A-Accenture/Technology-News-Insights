In the ruling, Judge Katherine Polk Failla noted that Bitcoin and Ether are ‚Äúcrypto commodities,‚Äù not securities. The judge was ruling in a case filed by Uniswap users claiming to have lost money to scam tokens on the DEX. It is not the first time that ETH has been classified as a commodity. The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had earlier claimed that Ether and other cryptocurrencies were commodities in a lawsuit against Binance earlier this year. The lawsuit alleged that Binance violated the Commodities Exchange Act. But the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not categorically classified Ether as a commodity. Last month, reports suggested that the SEC had urged Coinbase to delist all other cryptocurrencies from the trading platform besides Bitcoin before suing the exchange. The SEC has classified 13 cryptocurrencies as securities, including leading ones such as Cardano and Solana. Judge Failla is also overseeing the lawsuit filed by the SEC against Coinbase for offering unregistered securities. Judge Failla‚Äôs classification of Ether as a commodity does not officially give the crypto asset this status. But it comes as other judges make favourable rulings for the crypto market that are nudging the industry toward greater regulatory clarity. In July, a judge gave Ripple Labs a partial win against the SEC when it said its token, XRP, isn‚Äôt a security when sold to the public. The SEC had sued Ripple and its executives for engaging in an unregistered securities offering. The SEC plans to appeal¬†the recent decision. This week Grayscale Investments secured a major win against the SEC as the crypto asset manager moved to convert its over-the-counter Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a listed spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC is yet to approve any Bitcoin ETF. üö® JUST IN üö® The D.C. Circuit ruled in favor of @Grayscale in our lawsuit challenging the SEC's decision to deny $GBTC's conversion to an ETF!

The judge also vacated the SEC‚Äôs order to deny the GBTC listing application and said its earlier decision to block it was ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious.‚Äù The judge‚Äôs ruling does not guarantee that the application for Grayscale‚Äôs spot Bitcoin ETF will eventually be granted and it came as the SEC continues a crack down on the crypto industry. The regulatory body has filed lawsuits against two of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of being trading platforms that offer unregistered securities. Markets are also watching whether the SEC will approve applications for spot Bitcoin ETF applications. The next deadlines for the regulator‚Äôs decision on these offerings are fast approaching and analysts now believe that the chances of approval have increased with Grayscale‚Äôs recent legal win.
