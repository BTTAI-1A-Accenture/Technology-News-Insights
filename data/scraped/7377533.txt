Procurement and Contract Services Procurement and Contract Services would like to remind all faculty, staff, and students
                                 of the current State rental car contracts for use on official business that can help
                                 reduce travel costs.  Did you know that on a day trip to the coast or to Jackson,
                                 using a state contract rental car could cut your costs nearly in half?  Of course,
                                 those savings will depend on the distance, vehicle size, and number of days your travels
                                 keep you away from your office.  Although you must purchase the fuel on your own and
                                 seek reimbursement through the Travel Office, you can pay for rental car using your
                                 USM procurement card if you have one.     State of Mississippi Vehicle Rental Contracts For rental rates: In State Out of State We encourage you to use our links to compare these companies’ services and offerings
