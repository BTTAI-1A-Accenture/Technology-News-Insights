**BROOKLYN - **CarMax, the nation’s largest buyer and seller of used cars, has been named The Official Used Auto Retail Partner of Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets, New York Liberty and the Long Island Nets – the company’s first NBA G League team partner. The multi-year agreement includes in-arena activations, social media features and enhanced opportunities for fans to interact with the CarMax brand both digitally and in person. “We are thrilled to welcome CarMax, a brand with extensive NBA and WNBA experience, as our partner supporting the Brooklyn Nets, Long Island Nets and New York Liberty,” said Catherine Carlson, Executive Vice President of Global Partnerships at BSE Global, parent company of the Nets and Barclays Center. “We’re looking forward to collaborating on unique opportunities that will create a lasting impact for our Nets, Liberty and Long Island fans and the New York City community.” Nets and Liberty fans will be able to connect with CarMax through exclusive in-game activations – including the “CarMax Lucky Row” and “CarMax Courtside” seat upgrade program – as well as a branded content series of game highlights across all four properties’ digital and social channels. Additionally, a variety of digital signage on LED screens will incorporate CarMax branding during all events at Barclays Center – one of the highest-trafficked arenas in the country – including Brooklyn Nets and New York Liberty home games. CarMax will be permanently displayed on the sideline for Liberty home games and on the baseline for Long Island Nets home games. Photos of the signage can be viewed here. “CarMax recognizes the power of sports as a vehicle to unite people and drive change,” said Sarah Lane, Vice President of Marketing at CarMax. “At the heart of this partnership is a mutual dedication to the communities in the tri-state area and the incredibly passionate fanbases of these teams. We are excited to partner with the New York Liberty, Brooklyn Nets and Long Island Nets to elevate the fan experience, as exceptional customer experience is a cornerstone of our business.” CarMax will be the presenting night sponsor of the Brooklyn Nets’ annual Women’s Impact game, March 23, where the team will honor its WNBA sister team, the New York Liberty, in a variety of ways. As presenting sponsor, the CarMax logo will be included on a co-branded rally towel giveaway for the first 8,500 fans and will also be featured in a content piece that will play in-arena during the game highlighting women executives from BSE Global and CarMax. CarMax will also support the Nets’ and Liberty’s community engagement efforts to promote equitable opportunity, a pillar of the Brooklyn Nets & New York Liberty Foundation. There will be a focus on promoting active, healthy lifestyles for children through a variety of community events and activations. Beginning this month, programming will launch with Brooklyn Nets FIT, a year-long initiative encouraging children and families to live active, healthy lifestyles. On March 24, the Nets will host a basketball bootcamp for 30 youth from local organization PeacePlayers with support from CarMax. Future events will take place later this year during the upcoming New York Liberty season and the 2023-24 Long Island Nets season. CarMax's partnership with the New York Liberty is a continuation of the company’s support of women’s sports in the tri-state area, as the company entered a multi-year partnership with the region’s professional women’s soccer team, Gotham FC, in 2022. CarMax is the only shared partner of the Liberty and Gotham FC. CarMax opened three stores serving customers in the greater New York area in 2022, including locations in East Meadow, N.Y., Edison, N.J. and Wayne, N.J. The company has been recognized for 18 consecutive years as one of the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® and employs more than 220 associates who live and work in the region. CarMax has more than 230 store locations nationwide and has been the official auto retailer of the NBA and WNBA since 2020. © 2024 YES NETWORK. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
