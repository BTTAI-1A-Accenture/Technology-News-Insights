Insurance companies can now use turnkey marketing automation and customer intelligence to deliver the perfect customer journey across every financial milestone
 MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Total Expert, the CRM and customer engagement platform purpose-built for modern financial institutions, is helping insurance agencies and brokerages modernize their marketing processes and provide agents with actionable insights to engage clients and prospects like never before.

  
Total Expert is the industry’s leading engagement platform for banks and mortgage lenders, driving nearly 40% of all U.S. home loan transactions in 2022. Insurers face similar challenges in filling their pipelines that can be addressed by having access to real-time consumer behavior data, automating the outbound marketing function, and personalizing communications and offers based on consumer needs.

 
For example, with Total Expert Customer Intelligence, insurers can be notified when a lead or a client experiences a notable life event--like buying a home or car, or the birth of a child--to share automated, hyper-personalized marketing communications that offer policies at the moment of opportunity.

 
Many insurers rely on recurring premiums to drive margins and don’t have the time or staff to sift through behavioral data that may elevate opportunities to upsell or cross-sell. And traditional marketing efforts have been manual, with all customers and prospects receiving the same promotions, regardless of their individual needs. Now, insurers can use data to understand exactly where opportunities exist and quickly reach out using a library of customizable marketing assets and automated journeys. Insurance companies can also capitalize on Total Expert’s strong residential mortgage business. With mortgages a significant indicator for potential home insurance purchases, the platform can empower insurance companies and mortgage lenders to build seamless referral relationships.

 
Guided Insurance Solutions, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Baldwin Risk Partners Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: BRP) (“Guided”), is the first insurance company to tap into the power of Total Expert. Guided’s agents needed to efficiently aggregate high volumes of customer insights into one source to surface leads and opportunities that would have otherwise been missed. Within a few weeks of deploying Total Expert, Guided was able to identify significant qualified leads that were previously unknown, and that presented real sales opportunities.

 
“I first became aware of Total Expert during previous roles in the mortgage industry and experienced the platform’s unique benefits firsthand. It has tremendous potential to help the Guided team connect with new and existing customers through all stages of their life,” said Melanie Marsh, senior director of marketing at Guided. “Total Expert will be a total game changer for our marketing and lead generation efforts.”

 
As Total Expert expands into adjacent vertical markets, the organization has appointed industry expert Ilya Filipov as general manager of insurance. In this role, he will lead vertical growth and work directly with customers and prospects to address industry pain points. With more than 15 years of experience leading growth strategies across life, property, and casualty insurance, Filipov brings deep insurance expertise and networks.

 
“Expanding into insurance is a natural next step for Total Expert because our platform drives journeys for every financial milestone across the financial enterprise,” said Joe Welu, founder and CEO of Total Expert. “Insurance companies have many of the same struggles as banks and lenders. They lack tools that can nurture prospective customers and drive engagement with current customers. We uniquely act as a valuable link–a comprehensive customer profile that stretches across the financial institution with real-time customer insights that drive the right next action.”
