 Happy Wednesday and welcome back to the latest edition of Privy Presents, a newsletter specifically curated by Privy team to discuss digital identity and other closely related topics every Wednesday.     Rapid technological advancements, globalization, and social dynamics changes have shaped today’s younger workers to be more concerned in protecting their work-life balance that often differs from previous generations. This then leads to a “quiet quitting” phenomenon commonly known among today’s generations.  In this edition, Privy brings you a topic of creating joy at work to improve employee’s well-being. Reflecting on one of our core values ‘Joy’, we aim to build a mindful and convenient workplace for everyone.   Why is an employee’s well-being important?  Work-life balance is a distinction between one’s work commitment and one’s personal life including family, hobbies, social activities, and self-care. This is essential for maintaining physical, mental, and emotional health. Overworking and neglecting personal needs can lead to stress, burnout, fatigue, and various health issues. Prioritizing balance helps individuals to recharge, relax, and maintain their well-being.  This can also help them regain focus, boost creativity, and problem-solving abilities to their work resulting in higher-quality output. Balancing work and personal life enable individuals to invest themselves in other things outside of work to bolster their personal growth and development. Engaging in activities that bring joy, learning, and personal fulfillment contributes to self-development beyond professional achievements.  According to The Conversation, positive emotions like joy happen when we accomplish something that brings us closer to a goal and this can improve employee’s well-being and job performance to keep one motivated and engaged leading to a better work quality.    Benefits of creating a joyful workplace    How Privy creates joy at work  As an organization, Privy tries to create a culture of mindfulness by providing our employees with necessary support to keep their best at work.   In line with our mission to always innovate by adding new features or products which can be a solution to issues faced by our customers, we provide our employees with free access to online or offline courses/workshops to improve the needed skillsets.  To support our employees’ happiness and to create mindfulness in the workplace, Privy created clubs for our employees to have fun with those who share the same interests, one of which is Privy Tamiya Club. Other than that, we also have sports activities to maintain our employees’ physical and mental well-being such as basketball, badminton, futsal, swimming, and many more.  We also have engaging internal fun activities to help our employees reduce stress and stay out of boredom. Many of which activities are such as Privy Agustusan, Pekan Olahraga Privy (POP) and Privy Townhall. These events are expected to boost enthusiasm and strengthen the collaboration between Privy Squads.    In conclusion, creating joy at work is an ongoing effort that requires a combination of strategies tailored to one’s specific work environment and employees’ needs. We hope that by creating joy at work, employee’s well-being will be more prioritized and improved.    Thank you for reading and we look forward to sharing more exciting news and updates with you next Wednesday!   Until then, may you have a great week, and we’ll see you soon.  Visit our website and blog for more    Sign up, because #SemuaBisaDapatPrivylege  Keep in touch,  IG | Twitter | YouTube | Facebook | LinkedIn
