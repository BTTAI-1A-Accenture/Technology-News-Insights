The industry consists of a wide range of players, including large multinational corporations, mid-sized and small companies, and biotech startups. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, as some companies dealing in vaccines or treatments for the virus experienced increased demand for their products. The trend of spending on Covid-related drugs continued through 2022. Some of the biggest pharma companies, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), among others, are estimated to have generated approximately $100 billion in revenues in 2022, according to a report by Reuters. The current inflationary period has brought defensive stocks into the limelight as these stocks do not get affected by economic cycles. Pharmaceutical companies are often considered to be defensive as they deal in products that are considered essential for the maintenance of health and the treatment of illnesses, and demand for these products may remain relatively stable even during a recession. The sector also delivered positive returns to shareholders last year, when the S&P 500 recorded its worst annual performance since 2008. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained 4.91% from December 2021 to December 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&P 500 during the same period. The index returned 3.71% in the past 12 months. Though pharma stocks delivered solid returns in 2022, the sector had a comparatively slow year pertaining to merger and acquisition (M&A) deals compared with the previous years. One of the main reasons for this slowdown was that drugmakers acquired companies with authorized and tested drugs and products, instead of companies with products in clinical trials. Moreover, the economic headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates also hindered the deals last year. The deal value in the biopharma sector fell 42% in 2022, compared with 2021, as reported by Ernst & Young. It was not the case in the past as large-cap pharma companies closed 178 deals from 2016 to 2020 with a total value of over $452.3 billion. However, analysts are positive about the activity gaining momentum this year. PwC expects the total M&A deals to value between $225 billion and $275 billion across all sectors in 2023.

When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.” Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.” Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns a range of retail pharmacy chains. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.605 per share for a dividend yield of 3.19%, as of April 17. It has raised its dividends consecutively for the past two years.

Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023.  Suggested articles: Disclosure.
