Michigan's two largest power utilities continue working to restore power to customers hit in fierce storms last week. Consumers Energy said it had restored power to nearly 85% of the 200,000 homes and businesses hit by outages and was prioritizing schools ahead of the new school year. As of 11 p.m. Monday, about 11,000 Consumers customers remained without power, according to a release from the utility. DTE reported 14,300 of its customers without power at the same time. Consumers said restoration will take until the end of Monday because of severe damage in Kent, Ionia, Ingham, Eaton, Jackson, and Livingston counties, it said. “We’ve got 800 crews running 24/7 to make sure we’re restoring our customers,” said Chris Laird, one of Consumers Energy’s officers in charge for the storm. “We apologize for the delay in getting the power back on and will not leave until every last community is restored.” On Sunday, the company said it had called in repair crews from six states and had electric lineworkers working 16-hour shifts. Meanwhile, DTE Energy said it expected to restore the majority of remaining storm outages by Sunday night. DTE reported Saturday that 117,000 of its customers were in the dark. By the next day, it said it had restored nearly 90% of its customers affected by severe weather, according to its online power outage map. On Monday, one school district in southeast Michigan affected by a power outage, Ann Arbor Public Schools, said it has closed five of its schools: Forsythe Middle School, Huron High School, Lakewood Elementary, Thurston Elementary and Wines Elementary. A storm Thursday night spawned seven tornadoes in five counties across Michigan's Lower Peninsula, causing two deaths and destroying property. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency in Wayne and Monroe counties. cwilliams@detroitnews.com Staff Writers Charles E. Ramirez and Myesha Johnson contributed
