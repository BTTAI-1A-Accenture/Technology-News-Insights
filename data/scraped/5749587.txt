             After 9.5 years I have made the tough decision to close Exaptec, a robotics company specialising in #telepresence, #educational and #social robots. I wouldn’t have had Exaptec without Anton Rossouw, my deceased husband, who came home one day and said, I have registered Exaptec for you, off you go! Talk about a shock to the system!! 

It has been a steep learning curve for me and I have learnt a few lessons along the way - but I’m happy to say that I have “mostly” enjoyed it all!

Thank you to everyone that has helped and supported me over the years. I have met and made many good friends in this chapter of my life. 

I have a few robots looking for a home. Please DM me if you are interested in any #telepresence or #social robots. 

If you are looking for a great #robotics community to join then look no further than Robotics Australia Group, the peak body for #robotics in Australia, which is where you will find me now. 🤖

             Last year, the Monash Nova Rover student team launched their Pink Rover Campaign - aiming to ignite conversations about women in #STEM disciplines - to great acclaim. Monash Nova Rover are again pleased to host their #Women in STEM Panel Night on Thursday 1 August 2024, with guests who will discuss human-machine interaction as well as sharing their experiences of the barriers and biases facing women who pursue STEM studies and careers.

I'm very much looking forward to joining Louisa De Vries, Consulting Manager at Bosch Australia Manufacturing Solutions (BAMS), Dr Elizabeth Zavitz, Senior Lecturer at Monash Engineering, and Professor Dana Kulic, Director of Monash Robotics at Monash Engineering on this panel on the 1st of August!
