If you grew up watching stop-motion cartoons, you may remember the quirky, cheese-loving inventor Wallace and his canine companion, Gromit. Central to the cartoon’s premise is Wallace’s continuous efforts to invent complex contraptions, including a lever that launches him out of bed, a rabbit-capturing device and—of course—a rocket ship to discover whether the moon really is made of cheese. Unfortunately, Wallace’s ingenious inventions are only possible in the realm of claymation. But there are real-world inventors who work to create the devices, machines and other gadgets that we rely on every day: mechanical engineers. Mechanical engineers develop and deploy products that contain moving parts, from conveyor belts to cars. Mechanical engineering touches almost every aspect of our lives and offers diverse job opportunities, many of which pay higher-than-average wages. This article explores seven common mechanical engineering careers. Explore different types of mechanical engineering specializations, compare education requirements and typical salaries, and discover professional organizations that can support your career journey. Forbes Advisor’s education editors are committed to producing unbiased rankings and informative articles covering online colleges, tech bootcamps and career paths.

These products include engines, smartphones, wind turbines and robots. The mechanical engineering field spans multiple industries, including the automotive, aerospace, medical, energy and manufacturing sectors. Mechanical engineers design, develop, install, test and repair mechanical devices. Responsibilities vary based on the engineer’s experience level and specific industry. For example, automotive mechanical engineers improve the functionality of cars. They research and design improvements to vehicles’ suspension systems and aerodynamics. On the other hand, a heating and cooling systems engineer may develop components for air conditioning units. Mechanical engineers spend time developing, testing and prototyping their products. They must ensure the functionality and efficiency of their designs. Mechanical engineers also oversee the manufacturing process once a product moves into the production phase. Most mechanical engineers work in offices, but their work environment ultimately depends on their industry and scope of practice. Mechanical engineers may be called onto a worksite—such as a factory floor or an airport—to troubleshoot and repair faulty machinery. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), some of the top-employing industries for mechanical engineers include architectural and engineering firms, machinery manufacturing, transportation equipment manufacturing, scientific research and computer and electronics manufacturing. If you’re a creative problem solver with strong mechanical aptitude and a knack for mathematics, you may be a natural fit for a mechanical engineering career, but did you know that this field also offers strong growth opportunities and salary potential? The BLS projects mechanical engineer jobs will grow by 10% from 2022 to 2032—much faster than the 3% projected growth for all jobs. Moreover, mechanical engineering ranks among the National Association of Colleges and Employers’ (NACE’s) top 10 most in-demand degrees at the bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels, according to the organization’s 2024 salary survey. NACE reports median starting salaries of $76,740 for bachelor’s in mechanical engineering graduates, $82,250 for those with a master’s in mechanical engineering and $105,000 for those with a doctorate. Earning a mechanical engineering degree opens the door to various career possibilities. Most engineering positions require at least a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering or a related field. Getting a master’s degree in mechanical engineering can qualify you for upper-level roles and increase your earning potential. However, some engineering careers—like mechanical engineering technicians, for example—don’t require a mechanical engineering master’s. The mechanical engineering field is broad, meaning there is no one typical mechanical engineer career path. Below are a few common careers that highlight the diversity of the field.
