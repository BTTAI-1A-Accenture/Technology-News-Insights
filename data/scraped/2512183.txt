QUINN is a fashion brand that embodies the essence of contemporary women, celebrating their strength, timeless elegance, and fearless individuality, introduces the latest Winter 2023 Collection depicted in the concept "QUINN Art Academy" - a deep dive into the trippy, mind-bending aesthetics inspired by the abstract arts of the Catalan artist, Joan Miro. Bringing an endless creativity to every woman's style enthusiasm, the collection will enroll you to the Modern Art Academy where abstract dreams meet an awesome preppy twist be it top or bottom pieces or accessories. Distinctive palette of primary colors is painted on highlighted items such as the shirt-dress in blue and white contrast that is head-turning yet understated, the buttoned-front dress in creamy knitted fabric with twin-lined lapels, the cargo pants in bright green, and the co-ord set of blazer and trousers printed in brushstroke grids. The groovy palette from the artistic lens of Joan Miro is dabbled on the dull canvas background for a reimagined twist. Discover the inspiration from Scandinavian school uniforms on multiple plaid items and modern preppy pieces, ranging from buttoned jacket, cozy knit dress, bow blouse, gray plaid mini skirt, which make a perfect combination with masculine leather shoes with golden hardware accents. Transcending the modern preppy chic, this Art Academy will also teach you how to achieve that "undone" look through its mesmerizing creations of unintentional, effortlessly messy pieces in a sophisticated disguise from the frayed wrapped jumpsuit, the subtly dazzling sequin top that will make an entrance at the party, to the iconic O-ring bag in an all-over Q cut using a laser cut technique.
