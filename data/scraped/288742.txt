— Linda N. A: On our website, dmv.ri.gov, you can find in the “Forms” tab and “License Forms,” the “License/ID/Permit Application (LI-1Form).” If you print this out or click on it to view it, a “Checklist for Licenses, IDs and Permits” will also be available that will list all the acceptable documents that can be used for “Proof of Residency.” Today, a lot of people do not receive their bills through the mail and receive emails instead. The RI DMV will accept a copy of any of these “Proof of Residency” documents, as long as the person’s name and address are on the email bills. The most common type of these proofs are utility bills, bank accounts, payroll checks and automobile insurance policies that contain the person’s name and address. The list contains other choices as well. Your grandson will need a completed LI-1 form, too, when he makes a reservation to come to any DMV branch to get his new Rhode Island credential. Instructions on how to make a reservation can be found on the front page of our website. Branch locations and hours can also be found on our website. His current Massachusetts license will also be required. If his license is not available when he comes in, he must submit a driving record or license verification from Massachusetts. He would need to also bring a “Proof of Identity” document such as a state-issued birth certificate or a valid, unexpired U.S. passport. The “Checklist for Licenses, IDs and Permits” also lists examples of “Proof of Identity” documents that are accepted. REAL ID goes into effect May 7, 2025, so he may want to consider getting that as well when he comes in. REAL ID driver licenses and state identification cards will be mandatory to fly domestically or enter certain federal facilities when it goes into effect. Chuck Hollis is assistant administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles. Please email your questions to cars@providencejournal.com with “Ask the DMV” in the subject field.
