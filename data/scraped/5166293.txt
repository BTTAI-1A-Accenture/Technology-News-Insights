Ripley's, the entertainment company behind Guinness World Records attractions and the Louis Tussaud's Wax Museums, made the winning bid for the prop, which was autographed by actor Tom Hanks, who won an Oscar for his leading performance. The company may have been disappointed to find the box, bought for Valentine's Day, was not filled with chocolates but sand, used to weigh it down in outdoor scenes.  Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump in the 1994 classic film, pictured here with a box of... sand Holding company Ripley Entertainment is one of the largest amusement attraction companies in the world.
