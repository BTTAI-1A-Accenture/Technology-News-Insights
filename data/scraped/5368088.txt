Dick's Sporting Goods is preparing for what might be called the "Vestal Parkway Shuffle" just weeks after the company opened a massive store in Johnson City. The company, which was founded in Binghamton 75 years ago, closed a location it had at Town Square Mall in Vestal on August 8. That store had operated at the site for more than three decades. The Vestal unit was shut down on the eve of the opening of the House of Sport store at Oakdale Commons in Johnson City. Shortly after that, the company's Warehouse Sale store in the Parkway Plaza in Vestal closed its doors. A Town Square Mall leasing representative told WNBF News that Dick's Sporting Goods still had a few years remaining on its lease in that shopping complex. Company officials would not discuss what there plans were for the space. But workers have continued to be busy at that site in recent weeks, leading to speculation that another retail operation would be opening soon. The Dick's Sporting Goods website now features a "Grand Opening" banner for the Town Square Mall location. An online entry indicates it will be a "Warehouse Sale" unit that is scheduled to open next Wednesday. A company representative did not return calls seeking comment on the move.
