   Date (MENAFN- News Direct)            Vancouver, BC | February 21, 2023 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time Source: YerbaéEnergy drinks have always dominated the functional beverage market, but as consumers seek out healthier and safer options, yerba maté has emerged as a major contender. Yerba maté is a caffeinated tea made from the leaves of a plant found in the South American rainforest that provides a natural source of energy and antioxidants. The drink has been widely consumed across South America for hundreds of years and although it was introduced in 1900 in the US, the drink has only gained popularity in recent years. Now, the North America yerba mate market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2022 to 2029.In 2021, the Coca-Cola Company's Honest Tea launched a line of yerba maté drinks, while Perrier created its“Energize” line featuring yerba maté. The industry has also seen California-based organic beverage company Guayaki Yerba Maté take off. Guayaki brought on former Red Bull CEO Stefan Kozak to lead the company in 2021 and generated over $100 million in sales that same year. The company, which has already garnered over $100 million in previous venture-backed funding rounds, just raised $75 million in a funding round as per a January SEC filing offering $143 million in shares, with about $68 million remaining.Guayakí is not the only player in the yerba maté space. GURU Organic Energy, which was founded back in 1999, is a Canadian organic energy drink brand that includes yerba maté. GURU just reported its full-year 2022 financial results, ending the year in a strong financial position with over $56 million in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and unused credit facilities, reflecting prudent balance sheet management.Another company that is making waves in the space is  Yerbaé Brands Corp.
