Baron Asset Fund made the following comment about Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) in its Q4 2022 investor letter: “Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) provides technology solutions to financial institutions and also enables merchants to accept electronic payments. Shares fell in the quarter after the company reduced its financial guidance for the fourth quarter. The company’s growth slowed as banks delayed technology investments because of macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker consumer spending in Britain, a key market, reduced merchant processing growth. Wage inflation and higher supplier costs are also weighing on its margins. We believe the company is a durable growth business and the depressed valuation more than reflects near-term headwinds.” Copyright: stokkete / 123RF Stock Photo Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.
