 As inflation cooled down in December, marking the sixth consecutive month of slowing annual inflation, the market expects slower rate hikes ahead. Hence investors should consider fundamentally strong stocks Mosaic (MOS), AutoNation (AN), Ryerson Holding (RYI), and Bluegreen Vacations Holding (BVH) that look significantly undervalued compared to their industry peers. Keep reading. Following a year of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy, inflation rose at a slower rate in the final month of 2022, the biggest monthly decline since early in the pandemic. December's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a 6.5% rise in prices over last year and a 0.1% decrease over the prior month, on par with consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Also, the core CPI increased 5.7% year-over-year, compared to 6% in November. After the release of the latest CPI report, market pricing pointed toward an increased probability that the Fed would approve a 0.25%-point rate increase at its next meeting on February 1. This would represent another step down for the central bank after it approved four consecutive 0.75 percentage point hikes last year before slowing down to a 0.5-point increase in December. The Fed officials have projected at least an additional 75 basis points of increases in borrowing costs by the end of 2023. Moreover, Capital Economics Chief North American Economist Paul Ashworth recently said in a note that "after a final 50 basis points of tightening over the first quarter, taking the fed funds rate to a peak of close to 5%, we still expect the Fed to be cutting rates again before the end of this year." Given this backdrop, investors should consider investing in fundamentally strong stocks, The Mosaic Company (MOS), AutoNation, Inc.
