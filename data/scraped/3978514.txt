The Francis College of Engineering has been recognized as exemplar and with a Bronze Award for the inaugural ASEE Diversity Recognition Program. The ASEE Diversity Recognition Program (ADRP) was created to publicly recognize those engineering and engineering technology colleges that make significant, measurable progress in increasing the diversity, inclusion, and degree attainment outcomes of their programs. Katherine Moses ’12 came to Lowell to get a master’s degree in energy engineering. She fell in love with the city and has worked as Lowell’s energy manager since 2014, helping it become more energy efficient while also partnering with UML on sustainability projects. Cheryl and Paul Katen are funding a scholarship to give diverse students “a leg up.” For most of her professional life, Prof. Joey Mead has been interested in plastics. As one of the university’s first DC-CAP Scholars, mechanical engineering major Kevin Akers is pursuing his dream of becoming an astronaut — while also continuing to make a difference in the lives of others. By working with the Office of International Experiences & Study Abroad, chemical engineering major Nicholas Langberg was able to add a two-month internship to his summer school program in Germany. Brianna Atwood came to UMass Lowell to study plastics engineering – but she’s done so much more. The honors student started a volunteer program that connects UML students with a local school. She has also participated in the professional co-op program, working on fire-resistant seals for airplanes. Francis College of Engineering
