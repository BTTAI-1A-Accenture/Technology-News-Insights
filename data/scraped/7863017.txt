Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  OneMain Financial (OMF)'s high-pressure sales practices resulted in the deception of its customers, according to the government's consumer watchdog.
  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Wednesday fined OneMain Financial $20 million after the government watchdog discovered deceptive sales practices at the company. Half of the fine will go toward reimbursing customers, and the other half will be a penalty added to the CFPB's victim's relief fund.
  OneMain offers loans at 1,400 branches in 44 states, but the CFPB claims the company's push to hit sales targets resulted in illegal practices that cost customers money.
  “OneMain pressured its employees to load up its loans with extra charges through false promises of easy cancellation with full refunds,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “We are ordering OneMain to refund borrowers it cheated and to clean up its business practices.”
  The Evansville, Indiana-based installment lender makes money by offering "add-on services" like roadside assistance and unemployment coverage with their loans. The CFPB found employees were incentivized to push the add-ons to customers and sometimes did not tell customers the products were optional. In other instances, employees would not confirm with the customer that they would receive those add-ons before including them on the loan.
  Some 25,000 customers asked for refunds for these add-on purchases in OneMain's allotted "full refund" timeframe, but never received a refund for the interest accrued on the products, according to the CFPB. The company withheld $10 million worth of refunds on interest from these customers, the bureau said.
  For its part, OneMain said in a statement Wednesday that because customers received a refund via check and not statement credit, the interest associated was not refunded. This problem has impacted fewer than 1% of their customers over the last four years, the company said.
  "OneMain is pleased to resolve this matter related to our refunding practices for some optional products, even though we do not agree with the CFPB’s conclusions," the statement said. "OneMain provides valuable products to customers in a fair, transparent and responsible manner. We are deeply committed to our customers and doing things the right way."
  In addition to the fine, the consumer watchdog is requiring the company to change its policies, making it easier for customers to understand what products are optional and how they can receive refunds.
  OneMain said it will expand its full refund period to 60 days and allow customers who ask for a refund on optional products to receive a statement credit and have associated interest removed.
  Shares of OneMain were down about 2% in early trading Wednesday.
