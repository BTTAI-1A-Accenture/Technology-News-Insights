ULCC Frontier Airlines will open service on a host of routes in November and December—all focused on winter sun destinations—including flights between Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and Las Américas International Airport (SDQ) in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Denver-based carrier said the routes are a mix of new services and post-pandemic route resumptions. The PHL-SDQ route will be flown 3X-weekly starting Dec. 17. The all-A320-family aircraft operator will also commence service between Miami International Airport (MIA) and SDQ from Nov. 16, flying the route 3X-weekly.  Fort Myers, Florida, will see Frontier open five new routes in November. From Nov. 16 and 17, the airline will start flying from Southwest Florida International Airport to: New York's Buffalo (4X-weekly), Long Island Islip (daily) and Syracuse (3X-weekly); Detroit (DTW) (3X-weekly); and Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) (daily). Additionally, Frontier will begin daily service between Baltimore-Washington International Airport and Tampa, Florida, from Nov. 16. On the same date, the carrier will open flights between Chicago Midway and Cancun International Airport (CUN) in Mexico, flying the route daily—subject to government approval. Frontier will also fly to CUN from both DTW and MSP, operating the routes daily from Nov. 16. Cleveland will see two additions: daily service to MIA from Nov. 16, as well as daily service to Sarasota, Florida, from Dec. 21. The carrier will also start daily flights between MSP and Orlando from Nov. 16.  “Along with more routes to Florida, new service to Mexico and the Dominican Republic is also on the horizon,” Frontier Senior Vice President for Commercial Daniel Shurz says in a statement. “As we get closer to winter, now is the time to start planning those tropical getaways.” Aaron Karp is a Contributing Editor to the Aviation Week Network.
