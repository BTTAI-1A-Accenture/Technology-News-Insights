			Trending:		 A $5.2 million plan to pump water from Phoenix Lake to Bon Tempe Reservoir to bolster the water supply looks promising, Marin Municipal Water District staff said.Project engineers have agreed on the proposed alignment of approximately 7,000 feet of 12-inch pipe needed to move water between the two reservoirs, said Paul Sellier, district water resources director.What’s more, an inspection of the 1,200-foot tunnel at Bon Tempe where the new pipeline would connect was favorable, he said.“The conditions in the tunnel are pretty good,” Sellier said. “It looks like they’ll be able to reuse that access to Bon Tempe.”Sellier presented the proposal update on Oct. 10 as part of a progress report on the district’s strategic water supply roadmap, which outlines several efforts to add new water supplies.Phoenix Lake is only drawn on during water shortages because it does not have a pumping and distribution system. Instead, employees have to spend four weeks setting up a pump station and pipes to transport Phoenix Lake water to the Bon Tempe treatment plant.Building a new pump station and positioning a permanent connection between the two reservoirs is anticipated to yield approximately 260 acre feet of water a year, improving drought resiliency, district officials say.The project team is consulting with geotechnical experts, regulatory agencies and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. as the analysis and design of the project advance. The district is also soliciting an electrical engineer to assist with the design of the new pump station, Sellier said.

The project will require an California Environmental Quality Act assessment. The construction schedule would depend on what environmental impacts and mitigations are revealed in that analysis, Sellier said.One hiccup is that there is believed to be spotted owls in the watershed, which would require a seasonal shut down during construction. Ultimately, if the project is approved, it could require two construction seasons to complete, Sellier said. A proposal for consideration is tentatively set to be presented in the summer.The district’s application for a $600,000 federal grant from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, or USBR, to support the local storage projects failed in the first round. Staff is revising its application for a second round of funding, Sellier said.The district does have a $2 million drought relief grant, which could go toward supporting the effort, Sellier said.The district is also launching a study to determine the feasibility of brackish desalination of the Petaluma River near San Pablo Bay. Last week, the board authorized the general manager to finalize a contract with Kennedy Jenks Consultants Inc. for up to $124,643.Another near-term project would connect the district’s third-largest reservoir, Soulajule Reservoir, to the electrical grid at a cost of about $7.2 million. Like Phoenix Lake, the reservoir is only tapped during water shortages because it requires generator power to pump water.PG&E’s study looking at potential power options is underway. Previously, PG&E indicated the site could handle an 800-horsepower generator, Sellier said. Recent conversations, however, suggest that the only way to achieve that level of power is through eight, 100-horespower pumps, Sellier said.“Which is a very different prospect,” Sellier said. “So we’re kind of scrambling, and staff are looking into alternatives to see what can be done.”The good news, Sellier said, is that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ San Francisco office has allocated $28 million in grant funding for the Marin agency’s water supply projects. The Soulajule pump station electrification project is the office’s No. 1 “new start project,” Sellier said.At the same time, the district is exploring options for water conveyance from Sonoma to Soulajule, efforts that could be supported by the same funding, Sellier said.Another project to automate dam water release from Kent Lake into Lagunitas creek meant to benefit endangered and threatened wildlife is in the data collection phase.Sellier said a device to measure streamflow was installed in the creek in late September, but it appears to have been removed days later. Staff is working to install a new heavier device that would be secured to a tree, he said.Sellier said the district is continuing to work on new conservation measures.Related Articles

Board member Jed Smith said the district was the first water agency in the state to declare a drought emergency, and he feels that status hasn’t changed, putting them in a good position for funding.“I think we really do have some good potential,” with the USBR, Smith said. “We fit their mission and what they are meant to achieve with the smaller storage opportunities.”Board member Matthew Samson praised staff for the work put in to seek funding opportunities.“Good to see a lot of the progress,” he said. “It’s also good to see that the tunnel between Phoenix and Bon Tempe is usable … that’s a good sign.”Samson said he’s concerned about the Soulajule pump station project, calling it a “critical component of a resilient system.” He said if there’s anything the board can do to help advance the effort, he wants staff to let them know.“I’d hate to lose out on operating that reservoir whenever we wanted to if we could,” he said.
