(Human Re Sources)Nine years on from her breakthrough EP, the British artist is finally back on track with a new label and an artistic rebirth The journey to a debut album has been almost a decade long for British singer Rachel Keen, AKA Raye. First coming to prominence with the EP Welcome to the Winter in 2014, she released pop-inflected collaborations with everyone from producer Jax Jones to Charli XCX, rapper Mr Eazi and house superstar David Guetta. A hit-making featured artist, Keen’s own solo material has been uneven, and in 2021 she provided a reason, alleging on social media that her record label, Polydor, had been holding back her first album for seven years. The much-anticipated release of her debut LP , following her exit from Polydor, heralds Keen’s arrival as an independent artist. Her ear for a hook is apparent throughout its 15 tracks – on the thumping drums and bass-laden pulse of Escapism, the head-nodding house of Black Mascara and balladic crescendos of Ice Cream Man – while her vocals soar on the singalong chorus of Oscar Winning Tears. There’s a touch of pastiche on the doo wop of Thrill Is Gone, but overall the record showcases a self-assured songwriter, capable of producing swaggering floor-fillers. My 21st Century Blues is Keen’s artistic rebirth. Long may it continue.
