AKRON, Ohio, March 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp.'s FE utilities continue work to complete service restoration for customers who lost power after heavy rain and wind in Ohio, western Pennsylvania and West Virginia over the weekend. 



 More than 450,000 customers lost service across our system, and about 41,000 customers remain without service. Nearly 3,000 FirstEnergy employees and contractors are working around the clock on the restoration effort across all three states. Now that damage has been assessed, estimated restoration times have been set for each electric company. The estimated restoration times represent when the majority of customers in an area are expected to have power restored. Many will have service restored prior to that time, based on the level of damage encountered in a particular area. Some of the remaining repairs will restore only a few customers at a time, which makes  completing restoration a time-consuming process. Due to the widespread damage caused by the weather, we have thousands of remaining outages that require hours of crew work to restore one customer at a time.
