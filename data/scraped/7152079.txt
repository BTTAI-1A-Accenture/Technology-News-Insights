Originally sold for $666, it was expected to sell for about $200,000, RR said. The Apple-1 was signed “Woz” by Wozniak at an event at Bryant University in 2017.

It was brought to an operational state earlier this year by Apple expert Corey Cohen, the auction house said. It was purchased by a collector who wishes to remain anonymous, RR Auction said.
