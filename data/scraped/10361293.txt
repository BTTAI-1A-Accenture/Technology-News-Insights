The "Data Collection And Labeling Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Data Type (Audio, Image/ Video, Text), By Vertical (IT, Automotive, Government, Healthcare, BFSI), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2023 - 2030" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. DUBLIN, Sept. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The global data collection and labeling market is on a trajectory for significant growth, with an expected size of USD 17.10 billion by 2030, expanding at a remarkable CAGR of 28.9% from 2023 to 2030. Data collection and labeling involve the collection of datasets from diverse sources and categorizing them based on their nature, including data type and features. This process, when combined with AI technology, has unlocked substantial growth opportunities across various industries, including gaming, social networking, and e-commerce. For instance, social media giants like Twitter and Facebook have harnessed image-processing technology to enhance audience engagement. Companies utilize data labeling platforms to identify raw data for machine learning models, encompassing various data types such as text, movies, audio, and more. Notably, Heartex, Inc., a data labeling platform provider, recently secured USD 25 million in a Series A fundraising round in May 2022. These funds are earmarked for the development of an AI-driven open-source data labeling platform, aimed at streamlining labeling workflows for diverse AI use cases, incorporating features for reporting, data quality control, and analytics. The proliferation of digital capturing devices, particularly smartphone cameras, has led to an explosion in digital content in the form of images and videos. This abundance of visual and digital data is shared across numerous applications, websites, social networks, and digital channels. Many businesses leverage this online content to deliver innovative and superior customer services through data annotation. Scale AI, Inc., a U.S.-based tech start-up, provides data labeling services to autonomous driving companies like Waymo LLC, Lyft, Inc., Zoox, and Toyota Research Institute, showcasing the significance of data annotation in cutting-edge technologies. However, data cleaning remains a significant challenge in the data labeling process. Additionally, the complexity, time, and cost involved in developing machine learning models may require substantial resources for accurate results. Consequently, many companies are strategically expanding their presence in artificial intelligence-based data gathering. For example, in July 2020, Microsoft acquired Orions Digital Systems, Inc., a U.S.-based data management solutions provider, to enhance its Dynamics 365 Connected Store capabilities. This acquisition is expected to leverage computer vision and IoT sensors to help retailers gain deeper insights into customer behavior and manage physical spaces more efficiently.
