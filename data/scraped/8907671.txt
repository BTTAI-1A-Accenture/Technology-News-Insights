Formlabs has made a significant impact on the 3D printing market in recent years with its impressive lineup of SLA (Stereolithography) printers. The company’s newest addition, the Form 3+, builds upon the legacy of its predecessors with notable improvements and enhanced capabilities. In this review, we dive deep into the features, advantages, and potential drawbacks of the Formlabs Form 3+ to help you decide whether it’s the right printer for your needs. Design and Build Quality The Formlabs Form 3+ is visually stunning, with a sleek industrial design that looks equally stylish and purposeful. Its aluminum frame contributes to a robust build quality, ensuring long-lasting durability. One of the most significant enhancements from the previous models is the advanced Low Force Stereolithography (LFS) technology, which reduces peel forces during printing, allowing for smoother surface finishes and improved detail. Ease of Use Formlabs prioritizes user-friendliness in its products, and the Form 3+ is no exception. The touchscreen interface is intuitive and responsive, making it easy for even first-time users to navigate without much trouble. Additionally, the Form 3+ features extensive connectivity options across Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and USB ports to support seamless file transfers from multiple sources. Moreover, setting up the printer couldn’t be more straightforward. The time-saving PreForm software simplifies print setup so users can concentrate on design instead of wrestling with software. Print Quality The hallmark feature of any successful 3D printer is high-quality output – and in this area, the Formlabs Form 3+ excels tremendously. Thanks to the LFS technology we mentioned earlier, this SLA printer offers improved accuracy and detail over its predecessors. Users can achieve layer heights as low as 25 microns (0.001 inches), ensuring incredible precision across a wide range of print materials, from standard to high-performance resins. Additionally, the overall surface finish quality is outstanding. Support and Ecosystem Formlabs maintains a robust ecosystem around the Form 3+ that promotes user success. This includes an all-encompassing library of expert-tested materials and an ever-growing community of experienced users who provide valuable advice, tips, and troubleshooting help. Furthermore, Formlabs offers thorough documentation and responsive customer support, ensuring that users have the help they need when it matters most. Potential Drawbacks With its exceptional print quality and ease of use, it is difficult to find significant faults with the Formlabs Form 3+. However, some users might find its relatively small build volume limiting for large-scale projects. Additionally, the Form 3+ comes with a premium price tag that may be prohibitive for hobbyists or those on a tighter budget. Conclusion Overall, the Formlabs Form 3+ is an excellent SLA 3D printer that delivers impressive print quality along with advanced technology such as LFS. Its superb design, reliable support ecosystem, and user-friendly operation make it an attractive option for professionals in various fields such as dentistry or jewelry design. While its price point may be a barrier for some users, those who require top-notch performance will find the Form 3+ to be well worth the investment.
