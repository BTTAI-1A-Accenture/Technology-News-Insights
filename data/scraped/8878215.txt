Get the iPhone SE 2022 for a fraction of its price at T-Mobile.

However, if you have an older iPhone you're willing to trade in, Apple will give you a trade-in credit toward the purchase of your iPhone SE.  The iPhone SE houses an A15 Bionic chip, 4.7-inch Retina display, Touch ID sensor, and wireless charging. Although there's only one camera on the front and back, they get a boost from Apple's machine learning tricks to capture portraits. Face ID fans will also be bummed to learn that the 2022 iPhone SE doesn't support that feature. Despite those few limitations, it's still an excellent phone if you don't require
the cutting-edge horsepower we found in our iPhone 15 review.
