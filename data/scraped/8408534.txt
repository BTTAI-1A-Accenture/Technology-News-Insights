EXPERT TIPS Jason Metz Insurance Lead Editor Amy Danise Insurance Managing Editor Michelle Megna Insurance Lead Editor Ashlee Valentine Insurance Editor Les Masterson Insurance Editor Penny Gusner Insurance Senior Writer I suggest you create a home inventory to figure out how much renters insurance you need for your personal property. It can be as simple as creating one with a pen and paper, a spreadsheet, or photos and video on your smartphone. You’ll then use your home inventory as the baseline to set your personal property coverage. Insurance Lead Editor Figuring out how much liability coverage you need can be confusing. That’s why I recommend buying enough liability insurance to cover what could be taken from you in a lawsuit. You’ll want to take assets like bank accounts, real estate and vehicles into account. If you need even more liability insurance, you can also buy an umbrella insurance policy. Insurance Managing Editor I would go with replacement cost coverage over actual cash value coverage. That’s because replacement cost coverage doesn’t take depreciation into account and pays to replace your damaged or stolen items with new items. But ACV pays only the value of your damaged or stolen items, minus depreciation. Replacement cost coverage is more expensive than ACV, but it’s much better coverage. Insurance Lead Editor I’d encourage you to schedule high-value items like jewelry. That’s because renters insurance policies have “special limits” for stolen jewelry, such as $1,500. That won’t go very far if a thief swipes your $5,000 engagement ring. Scheduling personal property like artwork, collectibles and musical instruments covers your items for their full value. Insurance Editor I think it’s worth asking your insurance agent if the company offers discounts for having a protective device (like smoke alarms and fire alarms), being claims-free or multi-policy discounts, such as bundling auto and renters insurance. Insurance Editor I recommend you compare renters insurance quotes from multiple insurers to find the best price. Make sure you request quotes for the same amount of coverage so you can accurately compare renters insurance policies. Insurance Senior Writer Renters insurance costs an average of $143 a year for a policy with $15,000 of personal property coverage, according to our analysis of top companies. That comes out to around $12 a month. Renters insurance is an inexpensive way to protect your belongings and get valuable liability insurance. Renters insurance costs are often very similar among companies. Renters insurance rates vary by state. North Carolina ($92 per year), Wyoming ($92 per year) and Iowa ($93 per year) have the cheapest renters insurance costs for $15,000 worth of personal property coverage. Renters in Rhode Island ($345 per year), Louisiana ($298 per year) and Georgia ($287) pay the most expensive rates for renters insurance. Renters insurance costs vary by location. Some places are more prone to severe weather, theft and other factors that insurers take into account when pricing policies. The highest monthly renters insurance difference between the city and state average was for Detroit ($10) and New York City ($9), based on our analysis. California Your particular living circumstances may mean that one renters insurance company suits your needs better than another. The personal liability portion of a renters insurance policy can pay for medical costs for others if your pet injures someone. It can also pay for property damage caused by your pet and your legal fees in case someone sues you. But some companies exclude coverage for certain dog breeds. If that’s the case you could look for a separate dog liability insurance policy or switch insurance companies. Many renters insurance companies require roommates to have their own separate policies. Given the relatively low cost of coverage, it can be beneficial to have your own policy even if your state and insurer allow you to share renters insurance with a roommate. You won’t have to change your policy if your roommate moves out, and you’ll only be responsible for claims you make. If you rent a house or apartment off-campus, your landlord may require you to have renters insurance. Even if it isn’t required, renters insurance for college students has its advantages. Buying a policy means you can be compensated if your belongings are damaged or stolen. The insurance can pay for lawsuits against you and provide temporary housing if you’re displaced due to a problem covered by your policy. 
 Renters insurance covers more than just your possessions. A policy will include other valuable coverage that’s sometimes overlooked, like liability insurance. This covers your personal property, including items such as: Renters insurance covers damage from problems such as: You’ll select a policy limit for personal property, which is the maximum amount your insurance company will pay if your personal belongings are damaged or stolen. For example, you might choose $30,000 in coverage. You’ll typically have a choice between replacement cost coverage and actual cash value (ACV). Replacement cost coverage is more expensive but it provides better coverage because it doesn’t take depreciation into account. For example, if you bought a laptop for $2,000 three years ago and it’s stolen, replacement cost would pay to replace the laptop at today’s retail prices (minus a deductible). ACV would pay only the depreciated value of the laptop. Some items have “special limits” or sub-limits for certain types of losses. For example, a policy might limit stolen jewelry coverage to $1,000. That would be insufficient for a ring worth $5,000, for example. If you need more coverage for high-value items, you can “schedule” them so you get paid what they’re worth if they’re stolen. Many people think of renters insurance only in terms of coverage for property such as furniture. But renters insurance also gives you important liability protection. Liability insurance kicks in when you’re sued for injuries or property damage to someone else. This coverage also pays for your legal defense. So if someone falls in your apartment—or your dog bites someone—and you get sued, you can tap your renters liability coverage. A typical liability coverage amount within a renters insurance policy is $100,000 but for the best renters insurance you can increase that amount. Medical payments coverage is typically included in a renters insurance policy and pays for smaller medical bills no matter who was at fault. For example, if a guest slips in your home and suffers a small injury, this could pay out regardless of fault. Coverage amounts are small and usually start at $1,000. If you can’t live in your apartment because of a problem covered by the policy, additional living expenses coverage can pay for hotel bills, restaurant meals and other extra costs, like pet boarding fees. Remember to save all your receipts in order to make a claim. This coverage is also called “loss of use.” You can share renters insurance with roommates if your insurance company and state allow it. You’ll need to list your roommate’s name as an insured on your renters insurance policy. Many renters insurance companies require roommates to have their own policies. That means your roommate won’t be covered under your policy if their belongings are stolen or destroyed by a problem such as a fire. Renters insurance can be worth it and is an affordable way to cover personal belongings, and don’t forget about its liability insurance and coverage for additional living expenses. Here are common scenarios that renters insurance can cover: It’s simple to get renters insurance online. You can even do it from your couch and without talking to a human. Insurance company websites generally offer free quotes online. You may want to have basic information handy, such as how much coverage you want for your belongings, and how much liability insurance you need. When shopping for renters insurance, don’t make decisions based solely on price. Instead, use additional metrics like customer service and consumer reviews. Complaints collected nationwide against renters insurance companies expose problem areas for some insurers. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners calculates a complaint ratio for each company that reflects the number of complaints in relation to each insurer’s size of business. Among the companies we analyzed, all have complaint levels that are below the national average. To identify the best renters insurance companies, we evaluated each company based on the following. Renter insurance rates (80% of score): We scored each company’s renters insurance rates based on national averages for policies with $15,000, $30,000, $50,000, $75,000, $100,000 and $200,000 worth of personal property coverage. Source: Quadrant Information Services. Complaints (20% of score): We used complaints about home insurance (which includes renters insurance) upheld by state insurance departments. Most home/renters insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and handling of the claim. Source: National Association of Insurance Commissioners. If you’re unsure of which renters insurance company to choose, see Forbes Advisor’s renters insurance company reviews: Renters insurance is a type of insurance that is specifically designed to meet the needs of tenants. Renters can’t rely on a landlord’s insurance, which covers the building but not your belongings. Without renters insurance, you’d have to pay to replace all your possessions if a fire, tornado or other disaster rips through the building. Renters insurance not only covers your personal belongings, but it also includes liability coverage and insurance for additional living expenses. Plus, coverage for guest medical payments can pay out for small injuries to guests (such as up to $1,000) no matter who’s responsible for the injury. While renters often focus on insuring their belongings, these other coverage types can prove just as valuable. Renters insurance isn’t legally required, but a landlord might require it. Even if your landlord doesn’t mandate coverage, renters insurance can be a wise financial decision. Some landlords are requiring that tenants purchase renters insurance in order to avoid potential liability claims from renters due to damaged property from problems such as fire. Theft is another reason a landlord may require renters insurance for tenants. If your personal belongings are stolen, renters insurance typically covers this loss. Without renters insurance to recoup losses, a renter might decide to sue the landlord failing to protect the property. Landlords who require renters insurance often do so by including a clause in the lease. For example, a lease might state that the renter must provide proof of renters insurance within 14 days of the first day of the lease. You can often land a discount by bundling auto and renters insurance, and you’ll typically have the convenience of managing both policies from a single account. But bundling renters and car insurance isn’t necessarily the best move. You might find better prices by purchasing your car insurance and renters insurance from different companies. That’s why it’s a good idea to compare renters and car insurance quotes. And bundling won’t be the best fit if the insurer doesn’t sell the coverage you want. For example, not all auto insurers offer accident forgiveness coverage. The average renters insurance cost is $12 a month for $15,000 in coverage for belongings, according to Forbes Advisor’s analysis. Renters insurance policies include loss of use, also known as additional living expenses coverage. If you can’t live in your apartment because of damage covered by the policy (such as a fire or tornado), this coverage pays for a hotel room and other extra costs. Renters insurance covers theft of personal belongings both inside and outside your home. A renters insurance will only pay up to your policy limits you have chosen. For example, if you have $20,000 worth of coverage, it will only pay up to that amount. You can buy higher policy limits. Renters insurance has what are called “special limits” for certain types of items. For example, your policy might only cover $1,000 for stolen jewelry. That won’t cut it for expensive items such as a valuable watch. You can “schedule” valuable items, which provides extra coverage. Filing a renters insurance claim is a straightforward process, but there are a couple of things you need to do before notifying your insurance company. First, contact your landlord to let them know of any situation. If the problem is theft, file a police report. You’ll need a police report for a theft claim. Then, contact your insurance company or agent, but make sure you notify the company promptly. The insurer will want to know as much as possible, including the cause of the damage or loss, what’s been damaged or lost, and whether you need to pay for temporary housing. It’s also wise to take photos of the damage. The insurance company may send an adjuster to review the damage and loss. The renters insurance company will then decide how much you’re owed. You can appeal a decision if you feel that you should get more. Renters insurance can be a wise decision if a college student lives off campus, such as an apartment, and who owns expensive items. If the student lives on campus, such as a dorm, parents’ homeowners insurance will likely cover their personal property. If your college student lives in a dorm, find out if your home insurance policy has a limit on coverage for personal property in your child’s dorm, such as 10%—which is generally more than sufficient. For example, if you have a $100,000 personal property limit, your child’s belongings in a dorm room will be covered up to $10,000.
