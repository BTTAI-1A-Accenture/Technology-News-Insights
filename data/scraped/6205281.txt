 I write everyday and I belong to the target audience for Grammarly. I have seen this ad numerous times and once have I not skipped it. And more importantly, I need Grammarly. Jules, the VP of a ketchup company wants to increase the sales of their ketchup! Lesson 1, 0.15s: Observe. People’s choices can be difficult to understand with words, but it is easy to understand their body language, their expressions, and their feelings. We will notice what makes people happy, what annoys them, what people struggle with, and how much effort they are willing to make, if we pay attention, and who knows, we might get a billion-dollar idea! Observe someone’s behavior and ask ourselves what triggered their action. Here are some ways I observe. But don’t be creepy. 1. Watching the junior/background artists in a TV series/song/movie/play. They are more likely to break their character. 2. It is the pause between sentences that a speaker takes when he is refocusing on his thoughts. 3. The choice of words a leader makes while addressing their team. 4. The expression with which janitors do their job. 5. The enthusiasm with which a salesman explains you the product. I bet I have seen some spark in all the salesman who love their job. Being a good listener goes hand-in-hand. All right, so Jules saw her son sprinkle some glitters on his hotdog and voila! she has an idea for Sparkly Ketchup. Idea is fine, but execution is what drives the boat. Jules gets to her team immediately and they absolutely love the idea. The research begins with experiments, status meetings, and conflicting discussions. Lesson 2, 0.52s: Know your position and tone. There are multiple sets of people working in an organization. Mostly, people in segment 1 are the boss of people of segment 2. Everyone on the table is welcome to share their ideas during a brainstorming session. However, the ability to make decisions demonstrates clarity. Even a sensible idea, poorly articulated, can be ignored and forgotten. A person who speaks with a definite and confident tone is more likely to assert their point and win. It doesn’t mean to be bossy. Grammarly’s tone suggestion can help. ;) Jules’ team is on the same page now. Their flavor is currently getting prepared in the labs. But what next for the team? Lesson 3, 1.02s: Find your audience. It is common for entrepreneurial hopefuls to become discouraged after their first public work does not receive a lot of attention. We belong to the target audience group, that is why we love our product, look at it as one of the best inventions and believe it will disrupt the market. That’s not the reality. Many companies are selling the same product with different brands and packaging, because we all have different tastes. Its only water that people don’t care about unless the package says purity guaranteed. Hang on! Or have they started distinguishing on aerated, sparkling, mineral water too? Huh, well. Jules found their audience for their Sparkly Ketchup. Let’s start packaging. Lesson 4, 1.15s: Deliver more! Kids are going to love Sparkly Ketchup but that’s not the complete product. We need to be mindful of everything that we deliver. That’s right. Ketchup comes later, but what first gets in the hands is the bottle. Is it easy to hold and pour? Does it have a good grip? Does the cap fit right? Oh, what if we could have designed nozzles? The ketchup should remain fresh after breaking the seal. Is the transporting carton efficiently packed? Is there a way to keep the packaging lighter, sustainable, durable, reusable, and attractive? Everything matters. You see, it’s the execution that defines the true worth. Likewise, a product is not ready to serve when done, there are several other features that a customer would be experiencing once they have bought the product, such as its presentation, packaging, ease of use, maintenance required, and many more. And they would absolutely love the product only if their end-to-end experience is smooth as butter. Entrepreneurs don’t just have great ideas, they have great products. This 100-second Grammarly commercial could be your crash GTM (go-to-market) strategy to deliver a complete package when you are ready with a great idea. Lesson 5, 1.30s: Check on your product response. Work in iterations and improvise. Yup! That’s pretty much it. Like it? Here’s another commercial from Grammarly I loved.
