Lynn English High School freshman Uriel Fernandez, along with classmates Jaleel Khamis and Anthony Gonzalez, and his younger sister, Crystal, built a 10-foot wooden boat from scratch that will be used by a number of people in the Lynn community. As part of a partnership with the Boston-based nonprofit organization Community Boat Building, the students learned to use tools and implement math in order to engineer the boat, which has been dubbed the "USS Zero Point." "I can't believe building a boat would be this fun," Uriel Fernandez said. "We actually moved pretty fast," Khamis said. "We just started with the front and the back, and we started just moving up from that." "It makes me feel like I've actually accomplished something," Gonzalez said. "I'm proud of myself for the work I did," Crystal Fernandez, a seventh-grader at Thurgood Marshall Middle School said. In June, the student group will present the boat to Kayak and Sail Lynn, an organization founded two years ago that works to make water activities more accessible by offering it to veterans, people with disabilities and other students at no cost.
