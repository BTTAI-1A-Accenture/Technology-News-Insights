The whale, known as Pinball, was with her calf at the time, CCS said.  The team spent hours assessing the whale while her 8-month-old calf swam around her, periodically rejoining her to nurse, CCS said.  The team used large floats and a drag from a small inflatable boat to carefully remove all of the entangling gear that was lodged in her mouth, CCS said. The team stayed with Pinball until she rejoined her calf. The prognosis for both whales is much improved, CCS said. Video below: Man captures video of rare triple whale breach off Cape Cod
