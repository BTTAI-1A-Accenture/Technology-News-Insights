 Pine pollen is a yellow, powdery substance from pine cones of various pine tree species. The three species most commonly studied include Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Chinese red pine (Pinus tabuliformis), and Masson pine (Pinus massoniana). Pine pollen contains chemicals called saccharides (types of sugar), amino acids, and phytosterols.
  Very little is known about the nutritional value of pine pollen, and the science supporting any health advantages is weak. Nevertheless, pine pollen has been studied in vitro (in cells and test tubes in a laboratory), in animals, and in people for:
  Pine pollen should not be confused with pine bark, which has also been studied for several health conditions.
  This article covers studies of pine pollen, but there is not yet enough evidence to recommend it to treat any disease.
 Verywell / Getty Images Supplement use should be individualized and vetted by a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian nutritionist (RD or RDN), pharmacist, or healthcare provider. No supplement is intended to treat, cure, or prevent disease.  Scientists reviewed pine pollen research articles from three Chinese and two English databases. After reviewing 239 articles, the scientists noted that not enough evidence was available to conclude pine pollen’s use as a treatment for disease.
  The articles included 180 studies about pine pollen pharmacology, 37 studies about pine pollen used in people, and 22 review articles. This review was useful as a summary of future pine pollen research directions. Pine pollen has been studied in vitro and in animals for:
  It has also been studied in humans for:
  Although pine pollen has been studied for several health conditions, there's not enough evidence to suggest it can treat any disease. If you plan to try a pine pollen supplement, talk to your healthcare provider before taking it.
  Scientists studied pine pollen polysaccharides in mice with colon cancer tumor cells. They found that tumor growth was slowed or prevented. The researchers also conducted in vitro studies as part of the same experiment. They discovered that pine pollen polysaccharide (carbohydrate) stopped colorectal cancer cell division and triggered apoptosis (programmed cell death) of colorectal cancer cells.
  These results are not necessarily transferable to humans. More research is needed.
  Limited in vitro and animal studies suggest that pine pollen may have anti-inflammatory activity.
  Scientists who studied pine pollen polysaccharide in mice with ulcerative colitis, observed that the body weight of the mice increased, which was a sign of improvement. An additional outcome was a decrease in inflammatory chemicals.
  Researchers have also studied pine pollen extract in mice with arthritis. They found oral pine pollen extract decreased arthritis swelling and lowered inflammatory chemicals.
  Another in vitro study of pine pollen extract in human cells showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity.
  These results do not mean that these effects may occur in humans. Further research is needed.
  Researchers studied an herbal formula with pine pollen in rats with liver disease caused by connective tissue build-up. They found that the pine pollen extract decreased tissue buildup in the rat livers.
  These results are not necessarily transferable to humans. More research is needed.
  Researchers conducted an in vitro study to determine if pine pollen would increase cell growth to heal wounds faster. They studied the effects of pine pollen polysaccharides (carbohydrates) in animal cells. The study results reported an increase in the production of cell division proteins.
  These results do not mean that these effects may occur in humans. Further research is needed.
  Some brands of pine pollen focus on the theory that phytoandrogens (plant hormones) could function like the hormone testosterone in your body. Some research has been performed to test this theory, but not enough evidence exists yet to draw conclusions.
  For example, there are preliminary studies about phytoandrogens of other plants used to treat enlarged prostate in rats. However, quality evidence is lacking to support the use of pine pollen as a source of testosterone in humans.
  Far more research is needed to determine whether pine pollen benefits people trying to increase testosterone levels—which may not be a good idea in the first place.
 For some people, low testosterone levels may indicate an underlying medical condition requiring treatment. Rather than self-treating, speak to your healthcare provider if you're experiencing symptoms.  A 2012 study found pine pollen had anti-aging effects by extending how long human cells can replicate and by increasing anti-oxidant activity and decreasing inflammatory substances. However, these studies were conducted in mice and cultured human cells (cells grown in a laboratory), so it's unknown whether the effects would be the same in humans.
  Your healthcare provider may suggest pine pollen for a condition. However, consuming a supplement like pine pollen may have potential side effects. These side effects may be common or severe. 
  Researchers reviewed studies of pine pollen, and one study reported side effects of diarrhea, bloating, and loss of appetite. But in this study, pine pollen was combined with metformin, a drug that can cause those side effects. Therefore, it isn't possible to say if the side effects were due to metformin or pine pollen.
  Many people are allergic to pollen from trees and other plants. Don't take pine pollen products if you have pine allergies since the products may trigger allergic reactions.
  Symptoms of pine pollen allergies are much like “hay fever” and typically include:
  Pine pollen may aggravate asthma in some people.
  If you have a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, seek medical help immediately. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include but are not limited to hives, diarrhea, trouble breathing, and swelling of the face and lips.
  Call 911 and get medical help immediately if you're having a severe allergic reaction or any of your symptoms feel life-threatening.
  It is essential to carefully read a supplement's ingredients list and nutrition facts panel to learn which ingredients and how much of each ingredient is included. Please review this supplement label with your healthcare provider to discuss potential interactions with foods, other supplements, and medications.
  Pine pollen supplements could theoretically affect testosterone levels, leading to unwanted side effects. Like other hormones, testosterone levels should stay within a specific range. Use caution when using products that impact hormone levels.
 If you feel you've ingested too much pine pollen, seek immediate guidance from a healthcare provider.  Children, people who are pregnant or nursing, or people who have liver or kidney disease, shouldn't take pine pollen. Not enough information is available to establish safety in these groups.
 Always speak with a healthcare provider before taking a supplement to ensure that the supplement and dosage are appropriate for your individual needs.  There is not enough scientific information to determine an appropriate range of doses for pine pollen or related products. The correct dose for you (if any) may depend on your age, the condition you're looking to treat, and your overall health.
  Some doses listed on supplement labels may be unsafe. Always speak to your healthcare provider before taking this or any supplement since it may interfere with other medications or treatments for another condition.
  Storage instructions vary for different products. Carefully read the directions and packaging label on the container. In general, store supplements in a cool and dry place and out of the reach of children and pets, ideally locked in a cabinet or closet.
  A supplement similar to pine pollen is bee pollen. Pine pollen supplements sometimes have bee pollen added to them.
  Pine pollen is collected from the male cones of various pine species, whereas bee pollen is a mixture of pollen collected by honeybees from flowering plants. Both are nutrient-rich with potential health benefits that need further research.
  Pine pollen is sold in many health food stores and online in the following forms:
  Many brands combine pine pollen with other ingredients and sometimes a product may be contaminated with other substances. Thus, it's essential to read the label carefully before buying any supplement.
 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate supplements the way it regulates prescription drugs. That means some supplement products may not contain what the label says. When choosing a supplement, look for third-party tested products (such as the U.S. Pharmacopeia, Consumer Labs, or NSF) and consult a healthcare provider, registered dietitiannutritionist (RD or RDN), or pharmacist.    Pine pollen is a supplement made from pollen in the pine cones of pine trees. It has been studied in cells, animals, and humans for various health conditions, including skin diseases and enlarged prostate. However, there is insufficient scientific evidence to recommend it for any specific use.
  There is not sufficient safety information about pine pollen either. Because many people are allergic to pollen, use caution if you have allergies. Like any supplement, be careful with unfamiliar brands your healthcare provider does not recommend.
  Pine pollen supplements are found in health food stores, pharmacies, and online. Talk with your healthcare provider before taking any new supplement. It might interact with your medication or worsen an existing health condition.
