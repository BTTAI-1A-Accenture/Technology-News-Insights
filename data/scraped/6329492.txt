Fratello On Air has returned, and we cover several subjects this week. However, we spend the most time on a topic initiated by one of our readers about retro watches. Namely, are they at the end of their rope? We’re back a day later than usual this week with our episode, but we’ve made it! In this episode, we discuss a number of topics including some of the TV shows and movies we’ve seen lately. It’s not overly watch-related, but it’s cold and gray outside, so perhaps this will help pass the time. We also dive into a topic related to retro watches, a movement that has been with us for quite a long time. Will brands move on and go in a different direction?  Before hitting on retro watches, we have some yesteryear pieces of our own for Handgelenks Kontrolle. Mike kicks things off with his newly acquired Seiko SUS 4S15 “Military.” It’s a neat but small JDM-only piece from 1996 that was meant to lure younger buyers into the world of mechanical watches. That crafty Seiko tore down Switzerland with quartz tickers only to say, “Just kidding!” a couple of decades later with the promise of automatics. Cheeky Balazs, on the other hand, stays on the electronic side with an even newer addition. The two-tone Rolex Datejust 17013 Oysterquartz is in play, and Mike is jealous! What a score!  Saku, one of our faithful listeners from Finland, sent us a note and asked about retro watches. In particular, he mentioned the 2010s and all of the releases that take inspiration from the past. He was curious if we see things continuing on this path. Neither of us is sure we want reissues to keep coming in the same volume, but we do like them from certain brands. We love retro brands, but we’re not sure we dig modern brands relying so heavily on their back catalogs. MING, Rolex, Omega, and more make their way into the conversation! Thanks to Saku for writing to us. If you have thoughts on a future topic, please let us know! As always, thank you for listening!

 I’ve both contemporary and retro-style watches and I generally judge each watch on its own merits. My main proviso is that modern materials, movements and construction are used. Historical accuracy is nice, but functionality comes first for me. I don’t own any “retro style” watches but would seriously consider a 75th anniversary remake of the first Omega Seamaster in its original size and dimensions. Not a huge fan of the “seventies space inspired” cases like the Doxa’s really.  I believe a lot of retrospective watches are well thought of and liked because they stick to some universal qualities that are good, mixed with sentimentalt elements that connect to potential buyers. Some would be interesting because the original was innovative or simply had a very appealing design. One I found interesting back in the day was the Seamaster Polaris. It kind of summarised everything I didn’t want, and I really disliked it, although I still find the colour match of titan and gold alloy (bracelet/dial) nice. I still find it interesting, bearing in mind that I’m not well versed in horological history. I do belive their mix of 2 different alloys – gold and titanium was a first, and I believe it was hard to achieve. One cast with titanium and a 2nd with gold? “Polishing” a case consisting of 2 metals with different hardness would be really difficult.  Might have provided Omega with competence related to alloys that is beneficial today? A call for speculation, but it’s “success” might have put all other manufacturers off doing anything similar.  As far as I can remember I have only seen the Polaris on someone’s wrist once, a looong time ago, whilst they were widely available and displayed by Omega dealers back in the day. Would have liked this one as a curiosity:

I started hating this watch but ended up loving it, with two different models in my collection. Bring it on, I say! Forgive me if I missed you mentioning them but for me Armin Strom are the best offering on what I would consider very modern cases, totally in house calibers and extremely striking whilst still using classic techniques such as guilloche etc. The Hermes H08 is a wonderful modern watch that does not attempt to look back in time. Absolutely wonderful! © 2004 – 2024 Fratello Watches BV
