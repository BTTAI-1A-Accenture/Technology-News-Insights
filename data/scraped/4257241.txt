Mass media and entertainment conglomerate Paramount Global PARA reportedly has let go of its plan to sell its majority stake in BET Media Group. The group includes the VH1 and BET cable networks and BET+ streaming service. The move to end the sale comes as Paramount felt that it would not harbor any meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, the WSJ reported. The company notified bidders of the same on Wednesday, the report specified. The initial bidders included basketball star Shaquille O’Neal, who had teamed up with TV producer Kenya Barris and rapper 50 Cent and Group Black. Paramount had reportedly received bids worth $2 billion - $3 billion for its stake.
