 Crypto platform CoinList's Twitter account was hacked on July 22, 2023. Neon EVM alerted users to avoid clicking any links. Neon EVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine on Solana, issued a warning about a security breach involving CoinList's Twitter account. The alert, delivered via a tweet, cautioned followers, "Coinlist’s account has been hacked. Don’t click any links!!!" CoinList, a renowned platform for launching top-tier crypto projects, had previously announced the launch of its own token, $LIST. However, this tweet has now been flagged as potentially malicious, with Neon EVM urging its followers to avoid clicking any links associated with CoinList's account until further notice. This incident is part of a concerning trend of Twitter account hacks in the crypto space, which have often resulted in significant financial losses for followers.  On July 21, 2023, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams' Twitter account (@haydenzadams) fell victim to scammers reportedly active since April 2023. These culprits have created over 23 phishing sites in recent months, leading to the theft of approximately $3.6 million from around 358 victims. In another incident, the official Twitter account of cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin was compromised, causing some users to lose funds in a fake giveaway event. The hack, which occurred on April 24, lasted for almost an hour from 8 AM ET.  During this period, the attackers posted a counterfeit event on KuCoin's Twitter account, tricking users into believing they were participating in an official activity. KuCoin identified 22 transactions related to the incident and pledged to reimburse the affected users. As the crypto community continues to grapple with these security issues, these incidents underscore the need for users to remain vigilant and double check the authenticity of any links or announcements related to cryptocurrency projects. 8/19/2024 1:51:38 PM 8/19/2024 1:50:04 PM 8/19/2024 1:46:27 PM 8/19/2024 1:28:26 PM 8/19/2024 1:23:14 PM Email us at info@blockchain.news Welcome to your premier source for the latest in AI, cryptocurrency, blockchain, and AI search tools—driving tomorrow's innovations today.
