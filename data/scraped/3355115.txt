MANILA, Philippines — A majority of Filipino adults will be facing the coming year with hope, according to a Pulse Asia survey. The survey released yesterday found only 8 percent were ambivalent or could not say if they were hopeful or not for 2023, while only 0.1 percent said they were hopeless for the new year. “Virtually all Filipino adults (92 percent) will face the year ahead with hope, a sentiment echoed by 89 percent to 99 percent across geographic areas and by 86 percent to 94 percent in the various socio-economic classes,” Pulse Asia said. “Ambivalence on the matter is expressed by 8 percent of adults while less than 1 percent say they will face the coming new year without hope,” the polling firm added. The nationwide survey, conducted from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1, showed 43 percent of adult Filipinos believed their Christmas celebration this year would be more prosperous. It also showed that 42 percent expect their celebration to be the same as last year, while 6 percent said their Christmas celebration would be poorer than last year. Pulse Asia said the same pattern of public opinion may be observed in the rest of Luzon, Mindanao, Class ABC, Class D and Class E. Most Visayans (66 percent) said their Christmas celebration this year would be more prosperous while 58 percent of Metro Manila residents said their celebration would be just as prosperous as what they had last year. The survey was conducted on 1,200 Filipinos aged 18 years old and above, and has a plus/minus 2.8 percent error margin at the 95 percent confidence level.
