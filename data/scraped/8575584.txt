Revolut has launched a course to make cryptocurrency more accessible to customers.  

Launched in partnership with crypto platform Polkadot, users will be able to learn about staking and given the opportunity to collect DOT tokens â the native token of Polkadot â by staking directly in the Revolut app. 

This is the fourth cryptocurrency education course that Revolut has launched to increase literacy and engagement within the area. It explains the process of staking and the process of multichain interaction with visual materials, interactive cards and videos.

The course is available to Revolut customers in the UK and EEA who can get up to eight DOT tokens by taking the course and passing the final quiz. The customer can then stake these tokens in the app. At time of writing, one DOT token is valued at $5.64.

Revolut said that millions of its customers have completed a âlearn and earnâ course since they were launched in the app in July 2022. Revolut said it plans to add more courses this year to help people manage their finances.  

Emil Urmanshin, crypto general manager at Revolut, said: ââWe believe that the only way customers can make informed decisions about their finances is by making sure that they have all the right tools to understand how crypto works.â 

Revolut recently revealed its first full year of profitability. The delayed accounts for the 12-months ended 31 December 2021 demonstrate that the company made Â£26.3 million in profit over the period.
