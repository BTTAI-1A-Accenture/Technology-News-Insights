As a product manager, you need to collaborate with various stakeholders from different functions, such as engineering, design, marketing, sales, and customer support. How do you influence them to align on your product vision, prioritize your roadmap, and deliver value to your users? In this article, you will learn some practical tips to improve your cross-functional influence skills and become a more effective product leader.
 
Before you start working with your cross-functional team, you need to have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the goal you are aiming for. This will help you communicate your product vision and strategy, and align your team on the expected outcomes and success metrics. To define the problem and the goal, you can use frameworks such as the Five Whys, the Jobs to be Done, or the SMART criteria.
 
Influence is not about forcing your opinions or decisions on others, but about building trust and rapport with them. Trust and rapport are essential for creating a positive and productive team culture, where everyone feels respected, valued, and heard. To build trust and rapport, you can use techniques such as active listening, empathy, feedback, recognition, and appreciation.
 
Another way to influence your cross-functional team is to involve and empower them in the product development process. This means giving them a voice and a choice in defining the requirements, designing the solutions, and testing the assumptions. By involving and empowering your team, you can leverage their expertise, creativity, and motivation, and foster a sense of ownership and accountability.
 
Communication and alignment are key for influencing your cross-functional team and ensuring that everyone is on the same page. Communication and alignment involve sharing relevant information, updates, and feedback, as well as clarifying roles, responsibilities, and expectations. To communicate and align effectively, you can use tools such as the RACI matrix, the product roadmap, the product backlog, and the user stories.
 
Sometimes, you may face conflicts or disagreements with your cross-functional team, especially when it comes to prioritization, resource allocation, or trade-offs. In these situations, you need to negotiate and resolve the issues in a constructive and respectful way. To negotiate and resolve effectively, you can use methods such as the MoSCoW technique, the Pareto principle, or the win-win approach.
 
Finally, you can influence your cross-functional team by learning and improving together. Learning and improving involve measuring the results, collecting feedback, analyzing data, and identifying opportunities for improvement. By learning and improving together, you can celebrate the successes, learn from the failures, and continuously optimize your product and your team performance.
