We wanted to ensure that each piece not only looked fabulous but also felt like a dream to wear. Our testing process involved a combination of wearing, washing, and, yes, even dancing around the living room to see how the pieces held up.  We sought out the perfect balance between style and comfort, because no one wants to look great but feel like they’re wearing a medieval torture device. Here’s how we broke it down: Some undies can be rather racy, so it makes sense if you’ve asked, What’s the difference between those and actual lingerie? Lingerie is a statement piece, designed to whoa you and whomever may be lucky enough to see it. While the words can be used interchangeably, think if lingerie as underwear that sends a clear message. It can range from apparel to pasties, bustiers and even some pajamas! While some lingerie works for everyday, all lingerie should be able to stand alone as a showstopping garment.  In contrast, underwear is more practical, easier to care. Typically, it’s less elaborate in detail too, with its purpose being solely to protect your unmentionables from your outerwear.  Most lingerie can’t simply be tossed into the wash with everything else. Read the care instructions of yours to make sure it remains in the best condition.  Hand-washing with a mild detergent is better than machine washing. Afterwards, allow your lingerie to air dry. Store pieces separately to keep them from snagging on other items in your drawer.
