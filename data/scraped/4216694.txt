The site currently offers 149 units of "luxury accommodation". The applicant states that the proposals will provide new high-quality accommodation for guests, offering luxury short and long-term stays, while allowing guests to stay in close proximity to Portreath. The existing lodges are identified as requiring upgrading to "meet more discerning client preferences" due to their current limited internal floor area. The proposal would provide improvements to accommodation while offering a series of landscape enhancements. A selection of units would be provided with ramped access making the development accessible to a wider range of guests.
