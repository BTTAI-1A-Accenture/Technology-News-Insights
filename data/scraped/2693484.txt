A Hollywood star famous for his roles in drama series Everwood and 1979 film Hair, Williams was best known locally for his down-to-earth hospitality and generosity.  On June 12, Williams was riding on Route 30 in Dorset, Vermont, when he was cut off by an oncoming SUV as it made a left turn into an auto shop parking lot.  In an earlier interview with DailyMail.com, one eyewitness said the driver, Ryan Koss, collided with the motorcycle, sending Williams flying off his bike.
