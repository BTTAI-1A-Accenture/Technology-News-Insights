The Marvel actor is still on the mend at the hospital after suffering "extensive" injuries in a snowplow accident on New Year's Day  Jeremy Renner is continuing to give updates on his health from the hospital following a New Year's Day snowplow accident.
  On Friday, the Hawkeye actor, who celebrates his 52nd birthday on Saturday, posted an image on his Instagram Story surrounded by hospital staff alongside a message of gratitude.
  "Thank you renowned medical ICU team for beginning this journey," he wrote alongside the image with a series of prayer emojis beneath the photo.
  Friday's post is the third the actor shared from the hospital as he recovers from the severe injuries he suffered in a snowplow accident earlier this month, after which he was airlifted from his home to a hospital on Sunday and underwent surgery the following day.

  "He's so sexy, yeah," Renner's sister could be heard joking in the video as the camera closed in on the Marvel star's face. "Literally, look at all that blood," she added, as Renner indicated that the "spa moment" served as his first time bathing since he was injured by a 14,330-lb. snowplow while he cleared snow from his property on New Year's Day. "First shower in definitely a week or so," he revealed. "Gross!"

  Meanwhile, Washoe County Sheriff Darin Balaam said in a press conference the same day that Renner was helping a family member get a "stuck" vehicle out of the estimated 3 feet of snowfall from the night before when the incident occurred.
