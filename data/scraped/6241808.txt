GROUPON creates the majestic Holiday Unicorn to bring incredible discounts for this holiday season. The Holiday Unicorn has entered the chat, thanks to GROUPON that is. The newest character by the E-Commerce titan brings a satirical twist to the tale of the chubby old man also known as Santa Claus, by defying what you can get as a gift to people from the comfort of your own house. GROUPON and New Honor Society enlisted ANIMAL to join the team and create a classical Christmas track that fit this message of a, for a lack of better words, 'new classic'. Denis Aktas was the composer responsible for such a wonderful piece, working under the guidance of Alberto Fari√±as & Manuk Hovaghimian.  Will this new character stick around? Or will it be a once-in-a-lifetime tale?
