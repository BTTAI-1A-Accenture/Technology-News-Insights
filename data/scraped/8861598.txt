BRITS often work until the age of 65 to afford an easy retirement, but some jobs could see you retire as early as 50 years old. Those looking to enjoy the benefits of their labours early should look into specific careers - here are the top jobs to pursue if you want an early retirement.  With a base salary of nearly £32,000 per year, work as a police officer can be incredibly rewarding. And working in the public sector means you're tapped into a much more generous pension scheme, which could help you retire as early as age 50. According to the Office for National Statistics, upwards of 19% of police officers retire by the age of 54 - by far the highest ranking in the list of jobs surveyed. Fire service officers, from watch manager and below, rank second in the percentage of those who retire by the age of 54, with 12% taking their pensions early. The salary of a firefighter is on average £30,000 per year, but can reach up to £40,000. Similar to police officers, working in the public sector means a much more generous pension scheme than other careers.  Non-commissioned officers, meaning members of the military who haven't earned a rank or commission, also retire earlier than other careers. The average salary of a non-commissioned officer ranges from £35,000 to £42,000 per year. Some 10% of these officers will retire by age 54, with 27% retiring by 59 and 47% taking their pensions by age 64. Those with the rank of senior officer in fire squadrons, ambulance crews and in prisons have access to a generous pension. Some 9% of those in this career will retire by age 54, with 31 following suit by age 59 and 68% leaving by age 64. With a yearly salary of £44,000 and a large pension scheme, it's no wonder many are able to enjoy their golden years early. Those at the top of armed forces branches also rank in the top list of careers that let you retire early. Top ranking officers can rake in an astounding £124,000 per year, though the salaries begin around £29,000 on average. But 5% of armed officers take their pensions early, and nearly all retire by the age of 64. Experienced exam invigilators can make £26,000 per year and are given access to a great pension scheme. According to The Office for National Statistics, 5% retire by the age of 54, and 22% by the age of 59. Though it may not be the most high-paying career, it seems the pension makes it worth while.  Professional company secretaries can rake in between £56,000 to £130,000, depending on their level of seniority.  Whether working for a public sector company or private one, it seems secretaries are able to retire rather early. Around 5% are taking pensions by age 54, 6% take theirs by the age of 59, and 30% retiring by age 64. Brokers have a reputation for raking in large salaries, and on average make between £40,000 to £57,000. The competitive job sees 4% retire by age 54, 15% retiring by 59 and a whopping 35% gone by age 64. Generous pension schemes seem to attract many who wish to enter their golden years early. Those flying planes and helping to co-ordinate them can make upwards of £85,000 per year. And access to generous retirement schemes mean that many airport employees can leave their stressful jobs early. Last but not least, 4% of mining and quarry workers often leave their jobs and get pensions by age 54.  Some 20% then leave by age 59, and 39% are fully retired by the age of 64. The job is hard but could earn you up to £30,000 per year if you're experienced. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.
