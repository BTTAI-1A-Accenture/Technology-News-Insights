Chief Academic & Learning Officer (HCI Academy); Chair/Professor, Organizational Leadership (UVU); OD Consultant (Human Capital Innovations)   There is no question that various disruptive technologies have dramatically impacted all our lives, fundamentally shifting the way we live and work. In fact, the pace of change—the rate of emergence of new technological innovations—has seemed to speed up over the past decade. Several years ago, I found myself in a leadership role that involved several HR functions. At the time, AI tools were just starting to gain traction in the HR space; I remember feeling both excited and overwhelmed as I tried to keep up with the latest tools and systems. For example, my team and I started to use artificial intelligence (AI) in our recruitment process, using AI algorithms to sift through résumés and identify the best candidates for each position. This saved us a lot of time and seemed to help us find better matches for our job openings. However, as we relied more on AI, we also started to see some unintended consequences. For example, we discovered that some of the algorithms were biased against certain groups, such as women and people of color. We had to work with our technology vendors to adjust their algorithms and make sure that we were not discriminating against anyone. Overall, the use of emerging technologies has had a profound impact on my work as an HR professional since I started in the field over two decades ago. While these tools have helped me be more efficient and effective, they also have challenged me to consider how we can use them ethically and responsibly. Just like with my personal experience, many are now seeing how the increasing use of AI in the HR space has transformed the way organizations attract, develop and retain talent. ChatGPT is a conversational AI model that uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand human language and respond with appropriate messages. It is a type of deep learning model that is pre-trained on large amounts of text data and is capable of generating human-like responses to any given input. The technology is still in its early stages, but it has already shown significant potential in various HR processes. The use of ChatGPT and similar AI tools in the HR space is expected to increase significantly in the future, as organizations continue to look for ways to improve the efficiency of HR processes while reducing costs. As with any new technology, there are potential challenges organizations will need to consider when implementing ChatGPT in the HR space. As illustrated by my personal experience above, one challenge is ensuring that the technology is trained on a diverse dataset to avoid bias in its responses. Organizations will also need to ensure that HR employees are comfortable using ChatGPT, as some employees may prefer human interaction for certain tasks. Furthermore, organizations will need to ensure that the technology is secure and that employee data is protected. ChatGPT has the potential to transform various aspects of HR, including learning and development, talent acquisition and employee experience. Here are just a few ways I think ChatGPT can currently be helpful in the HR space: • Personalized learning and development: ChatGPT can be used to create personalized learning paths for employees, based on their skill set, learning style and career goals. It can also answer employee questions on demand, provide feedback on assignments and projects and even create simulations to train employees in real-life scenarios. • Virtual assistant: ChatGPT can serve as a virtual assistant for HR professionals, answering employee queries, providing automated responses to frequently asked questions and automating administrative tasks such as scheduling interviews, sending follow-up emails and sending reminders for employee evaluations. • Talent acquisition: ChatGPT can assist in talent acquisition by creating chatbots that can engage with candidates, answer queries, schedule interviews and provide candidates with information about the company and job openings. This can streamline the recruitment process and improve the candidate experience. • Employee engagement and retention: ChatGPT can help HR teams analyze employee feedback and sentiment by analyzing chat logs, performance reviews and other data. This information can be used to identify potential issues and create personalized retention plans to help keep employees engaged and motivated. • Diversity, equity and inclusion: ChatGPT can help HR teams address issues related to diversity, equity and inclusion by analyzing communication data to identify areas where bias may be present, and providing suggestions for more inclusive language and communication strategies. With all the potential applications of ChatGPT and similar technologies in the HR space, we do need to exercise caution. Here are two key recommendations for leaders and people managers regarding the use of ChatGPT in HR: • Invest in maintaining ethical considerations: While the use of ChatGPT can bring many benefits to the HR space, it is important for leaders to maintain ethical considerations. ChatGPT should be used to augment human decision-making rather than replace it entirely. Additionally, data privacy and security concerns should be taken seriously, and HR teams should be transparent about how ChatGPT technology is being used within the organization. • Invest in providing a seamless employee experience: Leaders should strive to create a smooth employee experience that integrates ChatGPT technology into existing HR processes. This might involve developing a centralized platform for employees to access HR services, including ChatGPT-powered chatbots that can assist with inquiries and provide support. ChatGPT has the potential to transform the way HR operates, providing personalized learning and development experiences for employees and streamlining the talent acquisition process. However, leaders must be mindful of ethical considerations and work to integrate ChatGPT technology into existing HR processes seamlessly.
