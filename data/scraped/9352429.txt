Fan experience and cashless payments specialists, Tappit, has contracted Nordic Wristbands as its exclusive provider for consumables, worldwide, to strengthen its sustainable journey. Nordic has been contracted to provide RFID-enabled consumables (wristbands and cards) for Tappit’s global clients, ranging from the NBA, NHL and MLS Leagues in North America to the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix. Nordic Wristband’s range of products are manufactured from environmentally friendly materials, either biodegradable renewable plant-based fibres or recycled plastics, with corn-starch packaging. Its partnership with Stand For Trees, which has protected more than 7,000 ancient trees, aims to compensate for the carbon dioxide emissions caused by fabric wristband and smart tag manufacturing. The project in the 250,000-hectare nature reserve of Mai Ndombe in the People’s Republic of Congo in Africa also focuses on securing education, healthcare and ensuring access to clean drinking water for approximately 30,000 residents. The area is also a critical habitat for endangered forest elephants and bonobo Monkeys. Nordic CEO Jone Nuutinen said, “We’re delighted to be working with Tappit, giving us the opportunity to introduce our sustainable products to new markets in the UAE and North America’s and hopefully help inspire more conversations around the environment, while helping to reduce the carbon impact on these high-profile events.” Tappit global CEO Jason Thomas said, “Nordic makes an ideal partner who share our values around sustainability and ethics, with a strong International reach.”
