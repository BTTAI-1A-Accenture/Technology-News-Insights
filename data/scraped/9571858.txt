"That is something that I have to live with for the rest of my life," Kardashian said during the "Keeping up with the Kardashians" reunion special. "I try not to have any regrets, but it’s probably the one thing I wish didn’t exist and if I could erase any of the stupid things that I’ve done in life that’s probably it."
