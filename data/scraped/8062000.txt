Palm Beach entrepreneur and investor Harvey Jones has paid a recorded $50 million for a lavishly renovated 1970s-era house that affords dramatic views of the Intracoastal Waterway on the North End of Palm Beach, where Jones owns another home. The one-story house that just changed hands at 940 N. Lake Way was built in 1974 and had not sold since 2002, when it was purchased for a recorded $7.37 million by Century Wines & Sprits Inc., a Delaware-registered company associated with the late businessman James V. Tigani II, who went by “Jimmy.”
