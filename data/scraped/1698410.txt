The end of summer is here, but don't freak out just yet, because you still have (at least) one iconic summer moment left—Labor Day sales. I t’s sort of like grown-up back-to-school shopping, except instead of pencils and crayons, I’m stocking up on sundresses and loafers that are absolutely necessary for the upcoming school year work week. Some fashion brands have yet to announce their Labor Day clothing sales (pssst, bookmark this page and keep checking back, we’ll be updating this article with fresh sales as they roll out!) but others have secretly started marking down clothes, shoes, and accessories as much as 60% off ahead of the actual shopping holiday, which falls on Monday, September 4, btw. Eeeep! If you’re wondering which specific clothing sales to keep an eye on as we get closer to the big sales weekend, know that there will be a lil something for every style and budget whether you’re looking to stock up on fine jewelry, swimwear, jeans, sneakers, or PJs. And in the meantime, Amazon is currently offering tons of fall fashion options at marked-down rates. There are also plenty of next-level sale and clearance options from Revolve and Nordstrom that you won’t want to miss. Put your phone on Do Not Disturb and grab a notebook (or open up the Notes app, let’s be real) bc we’ve got the best early Labor Day clothing sales queued up for your shopping pleasure, below.

Michael Penix Jr. is done for the preseason, Raheem Morris said. Mike Tyson had little interest in trash-talking or insulting Jake Paul during the press conference for their Nov. 15 fight on Netflix. Friday’s collapse marks the seventh home to be swept into the ocean in the last four years. The stylish star went big on black and white for her collection of dishes, decor and more with housewares brand Hudson Grace. Russell Wilson got his first preseason start after being held out last week. In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. Who will take over coaching Team USA for the Los Angeles Olympics? iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others.
