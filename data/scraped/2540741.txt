Rory McIlroy is one the major winners heading to North Berwick this summer Scottish Open Venue: Renaissance Club, North Berwick Dates: 13-16 July Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy is the latest player to join an impressive field for this year's Scottish Open at the Renaissance Club. World number one Scottie Scheffler, major winners Matt Fitzpatrick, Justin Rose, Justin Thomas and defending champion Xander Schauffele will also feature. "It would be great to win a title in the home of golf," said McIlroy, 34. With a prize fund nearing Â£6.5m, the tournament runs from 13 to 16 July. "The Scottish fans have always been very supportive of me," added McIlroy.
