Updated: August 20, 2024 @ 2:25 am    Education reporter   GAYLORD — If Friday's game against Jackson Lumen Christi was a measuring stick, the Gaylord Blue Devils proved they were tall enough for the ride. In a battle of unbeaten teams ranked in the top five of their respective divisions, the Blue Devils — No. 4 in Division 3 — outlasted the Division 7 top-ranked Titans en route to a 24-21 victory at home. Leading up to their matchup with Lumen Christi, the Blue Devils' high-octane offense ran through their last three opponents to the tune of 123 points while their defense allowed just 28 points in that span. The Titans weren't too bad in those departments either over their last three contests, scoring 112 points and allowing just a baker's dozen. Both teams were also coming off big wins as Jackson Lumen Christi (7-1, 3-0 CHSL-AA) won a rematch of the 2022 state championship game over Traverse City St. Francis, 35-0, and Gaylord (8-0, Big North 5-0) flew by Escanaba, 38-8. Gaylord built a 21-7 lead on rushing touchdowns from Ty Bensinger and Riley Hush along with a 16-yard TD catch by Noah Vanderveer from Caleb Aungst. But that two-score cushion was in question late in the first half as a botched snap put the Blue Devils in a 3rd-and-30 situation with under two minutes to play. A Gaylord punt two plays later gave the Titans the ball around midfield with 43 seconds left, and Lumen Christi quickly moved into the red zone. Facing a first-and-goal opportunity from the Gaylord 7-yard line, Lumen Christi opted for three rollout pass plays to the right. The only one close to a catch was the final play of the half, but that ball still sailed well over the Titan receiver's outstretched arms. Gaylord threatened to score as the Blue Devils opened the second half with the ball, but they could not convert on a 4th-and-20 to keep the prolonged drive alive. The Titans quickly took advantage of the momentum swing, scoring from nine yards out on 3rd-and-1 to cut the deficit to 21-14 with 2:58 left in the third quarter. Bensinger, who finished with 101 yards on 22 carries, converted on a big 3rd-and-1 to put the Blue Devils at the Lumen Christi 15-yard line in the early minutes of the fourth quarter, but disaster nearly struck on the next play. Gaylord fumbled the snap but managed to recover the ball, and Connor Byram connected on a 28-yard field goal two plays later to give the Blue Devils a 10-point lead at 24-14 with 8:41 left in the game. Lumen Christi needed to score quickly, and that's just what the Titans did. They started the drive in Blue Devil territory and found the end zone in just over four minutes, climbing within three points at 24-21. The Blue Devils couldn't risk giving the ball back to Lumen Christi, which meant they needed to eat up the final 4:21 left in the game.  Russell Hush ate 15 seconds on a 29-yard run to midfield, but the clock stopped when he ran out of bounds. Hush picked up another first down on a 3rd-and-5, this time sliding to stay in bounds and keep the clock running. The Titans were forced to burn both of their remaining timeouts on the next two plays, and a quarterback sneak on a 4th-and-2 from Aungst secured the win and kept Gaylord's record unblemished. With a perfect regular season on the line, Gaylord moves from a battle of the unbeatens to a battle of the Blue Devils at Sault Area on Friday.
