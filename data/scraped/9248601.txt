 Traditional data recording methods are frequently insufficient in meeting the demands of contemporary laboratories. Laboratory case management software is the answer to the evolving needs of any lab. It is a software system that improves patient care by enabling a patient-centric view of the patient’s case. and associated data.   Let’s discuss what it is and how it works, taking a look at the ISS-CM software system to understand how you can unlock your lab’s true potential with laboratory case management software.  This laboratory software is a networked data storage and retrieval tool that is intrinsic for the management and monitoring of any case, as well as comprehensive documentation of case management duties scheduled, undertaken, and completed.  Laboratory case management software is useful in a variety of contexts, including:  Laboratories can develop, track, and provide supporting documentation for follow-up activities using ISS’s curated and customisable laboratory case management software, ISS-CM. With it, your care team will always have full access to the clinical and general health data you need for your patients. As a result, the standard of care is more consistent, and the case management procedure is more effective.  ISS-CM software allows the design of reusable templates for your case types, and case management resources. These care plans include possible follow-up treatments to ensure that patients are properly treated and monitored. On top of improving the level of care that you provide for high-risk patients, monitoring can also be customised to include impending deadlines and essential steps in the care management program for each patient.  For critical events or routine ones, this can be a timesaving and productivity-driving addition to your business. ISS-CM software allows specific tasks and follow-ups to be assigned to teams based on the task requirements. These can range from clerical teams recording telephone follow-up to Genetic Counsellors providing advice to treatment centres.  The requirements of evolving laboratories need to be met, and the ISS-CM does just that. To learn more about ISS-CM, contact an ISS representative.
