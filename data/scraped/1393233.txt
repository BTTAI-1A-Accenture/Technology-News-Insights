Following Bowling Green’s 73–60 victory in the women’s NIT Super 16 on Thursday night, an ugly scene broke out during the handshake line between Falcons players and the Memphis players and coaching staff. Memphis star player Jamirah Shutes stopped the line and exchanged some words with Bowling Green senior Elissa Brett. After a brief altercation, Shutes appears to punch Brett in the face before being pulled away by members of the Tigers coaching staff. Brett was left laying on the floor by the scorer’s table, clearly shaken up by the incident. The situation has been passed over to the university police department, the Bowling Green athletics department told the Commercial Appeal. “Bowling Green University Athletics does not make comments about active police investigations. Our priority is with the health, safety and support of our student-athletes,” Bowling Green said in a statement to the Commercial Appeal. On Friday afternoon, the BGSU police department officially charged Shutes with assault, according to Jordan Strack. It is unclear at this time what provoked the incident in the handshake line. Bowling Green will face Florida in the Great Eight of the women’s NIT on Monday night for a chance to advance to the Fab 4.
