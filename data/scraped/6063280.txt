		 If a biotech company produces a single drug that becomes the standard of care for a particular illness, it could generate handsome profits for investors. But there are also risks. “These companies don’t necessarily have a proven track record of success or even extensive financial history,” says Harry Turner, founder of The Sovereign Investor. Due to the very risky nature of biotech stocks, we screened our selection of the best biotech stocks for 2024 based on several factors: a Wall Street “buy” consensus, market capitalization, liquidity, cash flow and risk level, factoring in accounting anomalies. *Market data cited is as of July 1.  Regeneron is focused on developing therapeutic human antibodies to treat eye disease, cancer, hypercholesterolemia, inflammatory diseases and other diseases. The company’s vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor Eylea is approved to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema. Its immunology drug Dupixent is approved to treat atopic dermatitis and asthma. Eylea, Dupixent and cancer treatment Libtayo each generated record sales in 2022, including full-year sales of $6.26 billion for Eylea, up 10% year over year. Regeneron has several approved drugs with opportunities for additional indications as well as a large pipeline of other drug candidates. Unlike many unprofitable biotech companies, Regeneron was in the “green” and generated $4.3 billion in net income in 2022.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company focused on developing treatments for cystic fibrosis. The company’s approved cystic fibrosis drugs include Kalydeco, Symdeko and Trikafta. Vertex’s pipeline also includes non-cystic fibrosis treatment candidates, including exa-cel for beta thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease, among other drugs for other conditions. Vertex reported $8.93 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022, up 18% year over year. Vertex’s Trikafta/Kaftrio combination therapy for cystic fibrosis accounted for 86% of the company’s total sales in 2022. Looking ahead, Vertex anticipates several new product commercial launches in the near term, including exa-cel in treating sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.  Sanofi specializes in prescription medicines, vaccines and consumer health care products, focusing on areas such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and rare diseases. The French multinational pharmaceutical company’s total gross profit soared 17.7% year over year in 2022. Its Specialty Care division delivered the highest sales among all its businesses in 2022. Dupixent, a medication used for allergic diseases, drove most of the strong performance in the Speciality Care division. Dupixent was approved in Europe in the fourth quarter for the skin condition prurigo nodularis. For 2024, Sanofi is planning to hit 13 billion euros in sales for Dupixent, helping guide the stock to low-single-digit earnings-per-share growth.  United Therapeutics focuses on treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Its leading PAH drug is treprostinil, which it brands as Orenitram for oral treatment, Remodulin for injection and Tyvaso for inhalation. Tyvaso was United’s biggest seller in 2022. Tyvaso sales were up 44% to $873 million, helping drive United’s overall revenue growth of 15%. Looking ahead, management said commercial uptake of Tyvaso in treating both PAH and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease will help United achieve its goal of more than doubling its annual revenue run rate to at least $4 billion by the end of 2025. Unfortunately, Remodulin is already facing generic competition.  Bristol-Myers Squibb is a global biopharmaceutical company that specializes in oncology, immunology and cardiovascular therapeutics. The company’s top-selling drugs of 2022 include cancer therapies Revlimid and Opdivo and anticoagulant Eliquis. Bristol-Myers’ fourth-quarter earnings per share beat Wall Street expectations, but revenue dropped by around 5% year over year (YoY). The company said foreign exchange headwinds and generic competition for Revlimid were largely to blame for the revenue decline. But sales of Orencia were up 6% and Opdivo revenue grew 11% YoY, excluding forex impacts. The company’s new products portfolio also generated $645 million in revenue for the quarter.     Methodology The best biotech stocks included above all trade on a major U.S. stock exchange and meet the following criteria: A biotech stock may seem like an attractive investment opportunity if a company is developing a drug candidate that has promising early-stage clinical trial data in treating a common disease or other medical condition. But developing a drug takes roughly 10 to 15 years and costs roughly $1 billion to $2 billion. Even after drug candidates enter phase one clinical trials, 90% of them ultimately fail, making certain biotech stocks extremely high-risk investments, according to a 2022 paper published in Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B. There are plenty of biotech stocks out there with upside potential, many of which could be worthwhile speculative investments if you can stomach the high risk. But these moonshot biotech stocks aren’t suitable if you’re a long-term investor looking for a greater probability of consistent returns.  While biotech stocks have a reputation for being perilous investments, you can reduce your risk by identifying companies that have healthy balance sheets and diverse portfolios of advanced drug candidates and commercial-stage products. "With well-chosen biotech investments, you can enjoy some huge returns as these companies transition from research and development into commercialization of their products," Turner says. In terms of valuation, the two largest capitalization stocks on this list, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Sanofi, have price-to-earnings ratios of around 16 or less.  And because every investor has different financial goals, here are some other stock lists you might want to review and consider: Biotech stocks offer you the opportunity to profit from the massive global pharmaceutical and medical technology industries. The extreme volatility within the biotech sector is also particularly compelling for speculative investors with high risk tolerance. The first step to investing in a biotechnology stock is to understand as much as possible about the drug candidates or other technology the company is developing and the market or markets they are addressing.  Once you identify potential biotech stocks to buy, try to track down opinions from analysts and other qualified third-party experts to see if they share your bullish take on the company. Smaller, early-stage biotech stocks rarely pay dividends, but there are plenty of established, commercial-stage biotech stocks that make regular dividend payouts.  AbbVie (ABBV), Amgen (AMGN) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are just three examples of biotech stocks with dividend yields of greater than 3%.
