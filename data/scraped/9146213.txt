Manchester United will be without midfielder Casemiro for Saturday's Premier League clash with Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. The Red Devils have confirmed that the 31-year-old remains in Brazil after sustaining a "small issue" on international duty, and he will join Lisandro Martinez (foot), Luke Shaw, Aaron Wan-Bissaka (both muscle), Tyrell Malacia, Amad Diallo (both knee) and Kobbie Mainoo (ankle) on the sidelines; Jadon Sancho is also expected to remain unavailable due to his well-documented fall-out with Erik ten Hag. However, Ten Hag has revealed that Sofyan Amrabat, who was forced to withdraw from the Morroco squad earlier this month, Sergio Reguilon and Raphael Varane are all available for selection after recovering from injury. Should Reguilon be handed a start at left-back, Victor Lindelof could move into central defence to partner Varane, meaning both Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans would drop down to the substitutes' bench after starting the 2-1 win over Brentford before the international break. Scott McTominay will be pushing to start after coming on from the substitutes' bench to net a late brace in the win against Brentford, and the Scotsman could deputise in midfield at the expense of Casemiro, potentially lining up alongside Amrabat.  Christian Eriksen and Mason Mount are also in contention to start and either player could operate in the number 10 role if Bruno Fernandes keeps his spot on the right flank. However, should Fernandes return to a central role, one of Antony or Facundo Pellistri may start on the right. Fresh from scoring for England in a 3-1 win over Italy in Euro 2024 qualifying on Tuesday, Marcus Rashford is set to retain his place on the left wing, while Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund, who also scored on international duty, is expected to lead the line. Manchester United possible starting lineup: Onana; Dalot, Varane, Lindelof, Reguilon; Amrabat, McTominay; Fernandes, Mount, Rashford; Hojlund
