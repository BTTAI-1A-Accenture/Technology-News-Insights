Sonic Drive-In is serving up summer a bit early with a new drink: the Strawberry Snowball Slush Float. The fast-food chain is known for its limeades – and Sonic has flirted with some out-there flavors such as its Pickle Juice Slush. But this new concoction, which hits participating locations across the U.S. on May 29 ($2.99 for a medium), is a mashup of classic flavors – real strawberries and shortcake flavoring – blended within a Sonic slush and topped off with vanilla ice cream and a sprinkle of sugary crystals to illicit a snowball-like crunch. Customers who use the Sonic app can get the limited-time drink early, starting Monday. “So many guests remember the feeling of enjoying a strawberry shortcake in the summertime, and our new Strawberry Shortcake Snowball Slush Float is reminiscent of that, but with an innovative twist,” said Mackenzie Gibson, vice president of culinary and menu innovation for Sonic, which has more than 3,500 restaurants in 47 states.

Among the new products, available while supplies last: a pool float in the shape of a cherry limeade drink, a teal-colored cabana outfit (shirt and shorts) with a flamingo sipping a Sonic drink, towels, sunglasses and cooler bag.
