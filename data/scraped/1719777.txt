  SANTA and his helpers helped show support for local charities at a special Christmas coffee morning in Kilmacolm.
 
  Villagers came in huge numbers to the Kidston Hall for the Kilmacolm Old Kirk festive event.
 
  In the grotto there were gifts made to help families being assisted by Inverclyde Women's Aid and other frontline services and a raffle in aid of Ardgowan Hospice.
 
  Locals also enjoyed singing from community choir Angel Voices and the Bridge of Weir Choral Society.
 
  Families joined in the fun too with a Messy Church session.
