Trailing 29-21 at halftime, the Ventures cranked up the defense in the second half, holding Everest to just 14 points after halftime.“I think the defensive effort was really ramped up. The way our girls played defense in that second half, it was just phenomenal. They did a really good job,” assistant coach Kevin Kaptur said.The other thing the Ventures did well in the second half was take care of the ball. Everest’s offense had been fueled by its defense in the first half, particularly in the second quarter. The Mountaineers were all over the passing lanes and had 11 steals in the first half, which allowed them to get out in transition. Everest racked up 23 points in the second quarter alone, often via their break.But in the second half, Everest had just three steals as the Ventures cut down on the turnovers, and that helped to stymie the Mountaineer offense.“We told the girls to settle down, move the ball and just play our game, and that’s what we did,” Kaptur said. “The biggest message at halftime was to take care of the ball and to play our game. Because that’s our game — we take care of the ball, we move the ball, and we’re hard to beat. And that’s what we like to see.”Offensively, the Ventures were led by 14 points from Alyssa Samartino and 12 points from Ryan Moorer.Everest was led by a game highs of 18 points and seven rebounds from Sarah Bradley whose post presence was a big part of the Mountaineer half court game, while Erica Walker added 14 points for Everest, but no other Mountaineer had more than four points.

Everest seized control of the game in the second quarter, going on an 11-0 run to turn in a 16-12 deficit into a 23-16 lead as the Mountaineer defense swarmed the Ventures in the final minutes of the first half.“I do feel like our defense played really well tonight and disrupted their offensive flow,” Mountaineers head coach Erin Van Wagoner said. “One of our goals was to shut down their 3s, and we didn’t quite shut them down. But we definitely disrupted their offense, which was one of our goals for tonight.”But once the Ventures started taking care of the ball, the Mountaineer offense dried up and Bishop Foley was able to rally in the third quarter to take a 37-35 lead by the end of the period.With the win, the Ventures improve to 11-3 overall and seize firm control of the Catholic High School League Intersectional 1 Division with a 7-0 league mark. The Ventures will look to clinch at least a share of the division title on Friday when they host Cranbrook.Photo gallery from MH Bishop Foley at Clarkston Everest Collegiate in CHSL girls basketballThe Mountaineers are now 7-3 overall and 5-2 in the division with both league losses coming in tight games against the Ventures. Everest also has a quick turnaround, traveling to Our Lady of the Lakes tomorrow for another divisional contest.“Considering we have seven underclassmen on our roster, to play against a mostly senior-dominant team that was incredibly experienced and went to the semifinals last year, it makes me proud that we put in that effort and we played them pretty even,” Van Wagoner said.
