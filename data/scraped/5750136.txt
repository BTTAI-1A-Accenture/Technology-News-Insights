 I want you to think as you read this article. I have a reason to say what I am saying or I have a “Design” in my mind which is making me write this. Not being philosophical, this world started by “Design” and since the day humans came they have been “Design”ing their life and world. We started to catch animals and eat to survive then we “Design”ed some weapons to hunt better. Not being cynical of our body we started to cover ourselves from rain and excess heat and sun. We later “Design”ed for specific needs. We have been doing and iterating it to even this day. We call it fashion “Design”  We used to make some sounds to draw attention of others later we “Design”ed our voice and drums to specific meter for specific thought, we called it language. For people who could not talk or hear we “Design”ed gestures to include them in our lives, we called it sign language.  Having done with food and clothes, we wanted to live better than in caves, so we “Design”ed our caves with paintings and floor and we called it home.  What is life without some fun and letting down our hair, we “Design”ed our entertainment and called it choreographed.  We continued to “Design” in all walks of our life. Lastly we started to “Design” our spiritual life with Art of Living, Raja Yoga, Krisna Consciousness, Sufi, Sermons, etc which surely gave us some peace of mind.  Yes your thought process is right it has been a century and more since we “Design”ed education. The world has moved, life has changed, ways of learning have changed, work has changed, gadgets have changed yet we are still in the last centenary as far as education is concerned. It is high time we “Design”ed education from what it is now to be more easy to learn, teach, comprehend and inclusive. It's time we “Design”ed it to be more relevant to present day’s requirement. This “Design” process evolved over the years has not ended yet. It will continue to be “Design”ed better and better and more sustainable as we move along. But it is our primary responsibility to re-“Design” our education. Lastly, even the world by itself re“Design”’s and it is called evolution. Come let’s “Design” or life’s and thoughts to have a better world. Let’s start with education. #design #education #nep2020 #designthinking #school   Founder & CEO at Proofile.in | Founder  RiiiiT - India's First IT Finishing School | Former Advisor to National Skill Development Corporation | Skill on Wheels | Former Skill Advisor to University of Mysore | Intresting Shankar  Human Resource |  Corporate Trainer | Ex-Laresen & Toubro | Ex-Indian Navy Thought provoking article Shankar,  keep it up
