The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company announced a new tread formulation for its ultra-high performance (UHP), all-season ElectricDrive GT tire, tuned for electric vehicles (EVs), in size 235/40R19. The tread compound will include Monolith carbon black produced by methane pyrolysis.

While traditional carbon black commonly comes from the combustion of fossil fuel oils, Goodyear said Monolith’s plasma-based process uses renewable electricity to complete methane pyrolysis and results in the output of only carbon and hydrogen, with no combustion required.
“At Goodyear, we are continually looking at and working with our supply base to understand and discover new innovations and technologies to use in our products,” said Chris Helsel, senior vice president of global operations and chief technology officer at Goodyear. “The use of carbon black produced by methane pyrolysis is an example of how we are collaborating with our suppliers, like Monolith, to utilize sustainable materials in our consumer products, without compromising on performance and safety.”
Goodyear said it plans to explore expanding the use of Monolith carbon black produced via methane pyrolysis across additional product lines in the coming years. Goodyear also plans to continue to investigate with Monolith the potential use of new technologies, such as the use of carbon black produced from methane derived from waste sources.

Continental said this tire features EcoPlus technology, which provides fuel savings and range, shorter stopping distances on wet roads, and better tread life. Continental Tire has launched the TrueContact Tour54, an all-season touring tire that the manufacturer said is a long-lasting tire for passenger cars and crossovers, ideal for dry, wet and light snow conditions. Continental said this tire features EcoPlus technology, which provides fuel savings and range, shorter stopping distances on wet roads, and tread life. The TrueContact Tour54 ranges in sizes from 15- to 20 in. in rim diameter. The tire stops 20% shorter in snow and ice compared to Nexen’s current all-season tire, the company says. Popular fitments include Audi cars and SUVs, BMW cars and SUVs, Ford Mustang and Mustang Mach-E, Nissan Z, Tesla Model 3, X, and Y, and the Toyota GR Supra. The tire offers extended range, comfort, and high performance in winter conditions on various surfaces, Pirelli says. The material, UPM BioMotion RFF, is a fully renewable lignin-based alternative to traditional carbon black. This partnership makes Goodyear’s the highest annual value sponsorship deal with NASCAR in 2024.
