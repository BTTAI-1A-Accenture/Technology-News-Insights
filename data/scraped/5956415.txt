Cameron Smith’s last worldwide win came at the LIV Golf Series stop in Chicago, his second Saudi-circuit start. Before that, it was the 150th Open at St. Andrews. Now, he’s in position to add to a career year. Smith leads the Fortinet Australian PGA Championship by three shots with 18 holes to play at Royal Queensland GC in Brisbane, Australia. After using a Friday 65 to vault up the leaderboard, the Aussie fired a Saturday 2-under 69 to separate from the field. It was an up-and-down day for world No. 3, cashing in six birdies while also adding four squares to the card. If he wins Sunday, it’ll be his fourth DP World Tour victory.
