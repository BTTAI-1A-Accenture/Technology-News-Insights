Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lauded Daniel Penny as a “Good Samaritan” deserving of America’s support hours after the 24-year-old Marine was arraigned on a second-degree manslaughter charge in the death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway. “We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left’s pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law abiding citizens,” DeSantis declared in a fiery tweet late Friday. “We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny,” he added — linking his message to a crowdfunding effort raising money for Penny’s defense. “Let’s show this Marine … America’s got his back.” By Saturday afternoon, the governor’s post had been viewed by more than 5 million Twitter users — and Penny’s GiveSendGo fund had topped $1 million. DeSantis has made attacks on Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg — who many feel charged Penny because he faced mounting pressure from progressives — a staple of his speeches in recent weeks as he gears up for a widely expected entry into the Republican presidential race. “This guy is … a menace to society,” DeSantis said of Bragg during an April visit to Nassau County. “His whole thing is he doesn’t want people to be in jail, he wants to downgrade felonies to misdemeanors,” DeSantis said. “Really, really dangerous stuff.” In August, DeSantis kicked a woke prosecutor out of office for refusing to enforce state laws relating to street crime and abortion. Like Bragg, former Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren was elected to office with the help of left-wing billionaire George Soros, who has donated millions to elect dozens of soft-on-crime district attorneys nationwide. “I removed [Warren] from his position. He is gone,” DeSantis boasted Saturday at an Iowa fundraiser. “And that’s the type of accountability we need.” Advertisement
