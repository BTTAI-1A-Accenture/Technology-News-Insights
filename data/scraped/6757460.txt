BOSTON (WHDH) - Federal authorities are investigating after the crews of two flights at Logan Airport said they were flashed by what appeared to be a green laser. The Federal Aviation Administration said the crews for JetBlue Airways Flights 494 and 972 reported being “illuminated by a green laser” around 5:40 a.m. on Thursday. According to the FAA, no injuries were reported in either cases. Laser strikes reported to the FAA like Thursday’s have been on the rise in recent years, with close to 9,500 happening in 2022. “It’s happening way too often,” said Tom Kinton, an aviation expert and former MassPORT director who spoke with 7NEWS about the latest incident about the dangers the lasers pose, especially to pilots as they get ready to land. “We’re talking about, at the very least, temporary blindness – like a flash bulb going off – then it takes several seconds to regain your sight and that’s not good at a critical phase of flight as this was.” In addition to local authorities being alerted, the agency announced it had started its own investigation into the matter. No additional details were released. (Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television. All Rights Reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.)
