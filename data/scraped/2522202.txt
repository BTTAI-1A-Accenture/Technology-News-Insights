The “Omdia Universe: Digital Banking Platforms, 2023” report recommends Backbase as a candidate in all digital banking vendor shortlists. Backbase had scored consistently strongly across all areas of the evaluation and achieved the highest overall ratings for solution capability and customer experience, according to report authors, Philip Benton and Ouliana Smith. The report highlighted Backbase’s strong solution capabilities and breadth of out-of-the-box journeys, combined with the ability for further customisation. The breadth of Backbase’s Engagement Banking Platform has increased significantly through investment in its off-the-shelf capabilities and its partner ecosystem, they further noted. Backbase had also been named as a leader in the past by Omdia in its “Selecting a Digital Banking Platform 2020–21” report. The company has worked with more than 150 banks around the world with its platform that was created specifically for digital banking and as a facilitator to enable strong customisation. “The Backbase Engagement Banking Platform has been instrumental in modernising the customer experience for our banking customers in Asia Pacific, launching them into banks of the future.   Techcombank for instance comes up often in discussions as a bank which is leading in digital banking transformation, and that, to us, is success.” said Riddhi Dutta, Regional Vice President, Asia, Backbase.                  Subscribe to the most important Fintech Singapore News
