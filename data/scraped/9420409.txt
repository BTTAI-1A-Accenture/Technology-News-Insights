A source said the Queen of Pop, 64, who is recovering after being rushed to an intensive care unit with the illness, was putting in epic hours in preparation for her upcoming 'Celebration Tour' at Long Island's Nassau Coliseum for weeks before she was said to have been found unresponsive and intubated by medics.

He said: "On Saturday June 24, Madonna developed a serious bacterial infection which led to a several day stay in the ICU. "Her health is improving, however she is still under medical care." Guy added Madonna's team expected her to make a "full recovery", but stated they were pausing "all commitments" including Madonna's much-anticipated 'Celebration' tour. He also promised fans more information and rescheduled tour dates would follow soon, adding: "We will share more details with you as soon as we have them, including a new start date for the tour and for rescheduled shows."
