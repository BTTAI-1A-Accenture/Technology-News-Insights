The company estimates FY24 revenue of $15.89 billion-$16.105 billion vs. the $15.99 billion estimate. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $16.17-$16.47 vs. the $15.95 estimate.

		  The analyst expects overall organic growth to remain in double-digits in coming years, expecting multi-year double-digit adjusted EPS CAGR through high-single-digit revenue growth in the Consumer tax segment, double-digit revenue growth in the Small Business segment, and high 30s+ margin.  William Blair analyst Matthew Pfau raised the estimate for revenue to $16.046 billion (from $15.802 billion) and adjusted EPS to $16.36 (from $15.59) for FY24 and $18.183 billion (from 17.804 billion) and $19.09 (from $17.88) for FY25.  Reiterating an Overweight rating, KeyBanc upped its price target to $535 (from $525) and Piper Sandler to $528 (from $497), while Morgan Stanley maintained its price target at $525.  KeyBanc analyst Alex Markgraff raised the FY24 revenue estimate to $16.060 billion (from $16.000 billion, vs. consensus of $15.957 billion) on better SBSE growth, partly offset by lower Consumer and Credit Karma revenues.  The analyst raised FY24 EBIT expectations to $6.237 billion (from $6.108 billion) on continued emphasis on operating expenses efficiency.
