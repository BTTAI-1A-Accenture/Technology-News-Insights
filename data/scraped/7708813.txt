 Nippon Ichi Software released a new video about its newest upcoming game,Â Xicatrice, focusing on the soundtrack. The video doesn't actually show any footage, but it reveals one of the music tracks that will appear in the game, "Shiki no Hazama." You can check it out below and enjoy the music while we wait to hear more about the actual game.  Xicatrice is coming to PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch, with a Japanese release scheduled on June 29. It was teased and then almost immediately announced in February.Â  The title is defined as an "Abnormal Powers X School JRPG"Â  and it prompts the player toÂ take on the role of a teacher who leads a special unit of students to perform dangerous missions. It focuses on the freedom of character development among a vast variety of skills, allowing each player to enjoy different strategies.Â  The player will have to overcome challenges together with seven students who have awakened their supernatural powers and suffered emotional scars as a consequence. The title "Xicatrice" aptly derives from the french "Cicatrice," which means "Scar."Â  At the moment, no western release has been announced, but we can likely expect NIS America to handle the localization at some point. As you may or may not know, NIS America is Nippon Ichi Software's western publishing arm and it localizes nearly all of the Gifu-based developer's games.Â  Have a tip, or want to point out something we missed?
