Cheniere Energy Inc. subsidiary Cheniere Marketing LLC agreed  to a long-term liquefied natural gas deal with BASF. Under the agreement, BASF will purchase up to about 0.8  million tonnes/year (tpy) of LNG on a free-on-board basis for a purchase price  indexed to the Henry Hub price, plus a fixed liquefaction fee. Deliveries will begin  in mid-2026 and, subject to a positive final investment decision on the first  train (Train 7) of the Sabine Pass Liquefaction expansion project (SPL expansion  project) in Cameron Parish, La., will increase to about 0.8 million tpy upon the start of  commercial operations of Train 7. The agreement extends through 2043. “By establishing our own dedicated LNG supply chain with  Cheniere, we are diversifying our energy and raw materials portfolio at a time  of critical changes in the European gas market, which is marked by increased  demand and volatile prices for LNG,” said Dr. Dirk Elvermann, BASF’s chief financial officer.  The SPL expansion project is being developed for up to about  20 million tpy of total LNG capacity (OGJ Online, Feb. 23, 2023). In May 2023, certain subsidiaries of  Cheniere Energy Partners LP entered the pre-filing review process with respect  to the project with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
