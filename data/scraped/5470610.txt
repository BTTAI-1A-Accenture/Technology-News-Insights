 The impact of conscious consumers continues to grow as shoppers across industries seek expanded choice and transparency during the shopping experience. The beverage alcohol industry, while historically dominated by white men, has seen more diversity awareness from consumers and brands alike – though there’s still more work to be done. The popularity of minority-owned filters on Drizly continues to grow, demonstrating increasing consumer appetites for diversity across the drinks industry.  Specifically, the number of Black-owned brands available on Drizly increased an additional 15 percent over 2021 levels. Among popular Black-owned brands, the impact of celebrity endorsements is clear, with Cîroc vodka, made by Sean “Diddy” Combs, and Champagne and Cognac from musician Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson l topping the Drizly charts. However Jack Summers, the founder of Sorel Liqueur and first Black person to hold a distilling license in New York since Prohibition, suggests retailers can make the biggest difference by supporting non-celebrity-endorsed Black-owned brands. “Big brands have enough money to remind you they exist every second of every day. We have to be more strategic; we compete not through brute force marketing but by creating remarkable experiences,” he says. “The moment someone thinks you’re selling to them they stop listening to your pitch, but a great experience? People never forget the way you make them feel.” Clearly, consumers have been feeling the pull toward Black- and minority-owned brands for the past few years, according to data from across the Drizly universe. Following the launch of the “Black-owned” tag on Drizly in June 2020, share sales for Drizly’s top-selling Black-owned brands were up anywhere from 40 to 585 percent over May 2020 share of sales. As of 2021, over 65 percent of Drizly retailers carried products from Black-owned brands. Similarly, the volume of Black-owned brands available to shop on Drizly has grown dramatically: The number of Black-owned SKUs available on Drizly increased by over ten percent in 2022 versus 2021, and Black-owned brand sales now account for more than two percent share of overall sales on the platform. In 2022, the most popular Black-owned brands on Drizly included a mix of new arrivals and longstanding favourites such as Uncle Nearest Whiskey, the McBride Sisters wine collection, Maison Noir Wines, Union Craft Brewing, and Sun Goddess.
