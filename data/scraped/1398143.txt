MLB FORT MYERS, Fla. — Several Twins pitchers got a head start on their offseason programs with a trip to Driveline last October. A noisy neighbor ensured they started even earlier than planned. One day after the 2022 campaign ended, Joe Ryan, Griffin Jax and Caleb Thielbar flew to Seattle to work on pitch development at the acclaimed baseball facility. They wanted to be assessed by Driveline’s technology while they were still in game shape. Advertisement In search of new pitches and refined mechanics, the trio rented an Airbnb for a week. Little did they know their picturesque lake house was located next to a farm. “It was a nice place, but the next-door neighbor had this rooster,” Thielbar said. “They had chickens running around in the yard and one of them was a rooster. That thing would start crowing at like 4:45 in the morning and it wouldn’t stop. “Stupid rooster.” While they might reconsider their loud accommodations, none of the pitchers have any doubts about making the trip. Not when each member of the traveling party and teammate Tyler Mahle, who made a trip of his own to Driveline, arrived in camp last month with increased fastball velocities and nasty stuff attached to their new pitches. At one time the work ethic of these players would have been considered an outlier, but that’s no longer the case. With technology providing new avenues for individual development, baseball has become a year-round sport for most players who know talent alone won’t keep them employed. “Every aspect of what’s going on right now, that would’ve been completely foreign to any player just 10 years ago,” Twins manager Rocco Baldelli. “Basically, you’d be speaking a different language. … It would be shocking to see what these guys do when they go home at the end of the year.” Ryan didn’t have to wait for the end of the season to know a trip to Driveline was warranted. Though he finished a very good rookie campaign by going 13-8 with a 3.55 ERA and 151 strikeouts in 147 innings, Ryan knew there was room for improvement. Rough road starts in the second half against the Dodgers, Padres, Yankees and at home versus the Red Sox (he combined to allow 24 earned runs in 18 2/3 innings) suggested Ryan needed more consistency with his secondary pitches. Advertisement Ryan wanted to improve his slider in particular. He liked a grip Jax showed him in September and had success with it, but needed to make it more consistent for game use. “Giving up probably like 30 extra runs on sliders is usually a good idea to maybe make an adjustment,” Ryan said. “It was just good to see what the possibilities were … it helps me a lot to know the reason for things.” Joe Ryan has gotten comfortable with a couple offerings to compliment that Elite Four-Seamer… Sweeping Slider 🧹Split Changeup 🖖#TheJoeRyanExperience#JoeRyanThrowsOffSpeed 🧵 https://t.co/QENkqLLEdT pic.twitter.com/c443wACYgD — Chris Langin (@LanginTots13) February 21, 2023  When he arrived in Washington, Ryan learned the reason his slider was inconsistent wasn’t the grip, but the amount of pressure he applied with his fingers. One of the first steps in the process at Driveline is the physical assessment, including a motion capture session in which pitchers wear stickers across their bodies and throw to allow cameras and computers to gather data. Driveline’s biomechanists then clean up the data and present a report to each pitcher on where they might have deficiencies. “He’s got the perfect (arm) slot for a sweeper,” Driveline director of pitching Chris Langin said of Ryan. “The main modification was an alteration to the grip. It was a spike on the index finger and it allowed him to stay in front of the ball when he threw it, which basically makes it when you’re in a game environment you’re not backing it up too much. … It was just pretty clear that if he can just develop some 50-grade secondary stuff, that’s going to help you a ton.” After a player is assessed, the real work begins. In Ryan’s case, he was asked to throw 20 straight sliders, which were assessed by Rapsodo cameras measuring the spin rate and axis of each pitch. Of those 20 pitches, the top four in terms of stuff were identified and Ryan was then asked to try to replicate his grip and throwing motion to achieve similar results. Advertisement “We can give him pretty quick feedback,” Langin said. “You can get that figured out in a session. Generally what happens is guys will flash like three to four good ones in a session and then the idea is next time we throw 20, let’s try to get seven or eight and you slowly up that number to 90 percent. Then when you run with the stuff model, it can really add some confidence.” Driveline also offers a strength and conditioning assessment and provides ideas on pitch design. With Ryan, Driveline also suggested he develop a split-changeup. For Jax, it meant adding a cut-fastball to pair with a sweeping slider he threw 48 percent of the time last season. Even though his average velocity increased from 92.6 mph to 95.4 mph after he moved into the bullpen, Jax doesn’t trust his four-seam fastball when he needs a swing-and-miss. As they typically do with major-league pitchers who plan to visit, Driveline researched Jax ahead of time and presented several concepts. Though they didn’t suggest using the cutter in a game over the final month, Langin thought Jax might experiment with it while playing catch. “We don’t approach this as if we’re correct,” Langin said. “We bounce off this idea, we’re asking questions, ‘Here’s the quantitative data’ and we want some qualitative insights on what they think they can do. We’re going to train them with the intent of, ‘Does this guy want to get better?’” Jax was inspired to travel to Driveline after hearing Thielbar praise the facility for helping him with improved mechanics and an increase in fastball velocity. When they suggested a cutter, Jax was intrigued. From there, Jax went to work on a pitch born in a lab. The goal was to make sure he could throw it 92 mph for the pitch to be effective. For three months, Jax worked on the cutter in front of Driveline’s cameras at their Washington and Arizona facilities. He lives near Driveline’s newest facility in North Scottsdale and could refine the pitch over the offseason. Then he began throwing his new toy to left-handed hitters in several live batting practices at the facility. Advertisement “No one has put it in play yet, so that’s a win,” Jax said. “For the first two to three months, I was just on the mound hammering the pitch shape and making sure 95 percent of the time it was going to move the same way every single time. The second step was getting it in the zone. When I started to throw lives, I just wanted to get it in the zone. I didn’t care really where it was. But as long as I could throw it for strikes, that’s the biggest thing. … Saw that a lot. I was able to put it in spots where if they swung they were swinging and missing or they were good misses.” Tyler Mahle crushed it this offseason. Here's a peek at that revamped slider he's been developing.  Has been pretty damn good vs. lefties across the last 3 years… so this was the pitch to target for 2023.   🧹🧹🧹 https://t.co/5gZqMc3nXc pic.twitter.com/25SYGYOTBW — Chris Langin (@LanginTots13) February 18, 2023  To put him in a better spot, Driveline approached Mahle’s agent and suggested the addition of a split-changeup and revamped slider. Their pitch was based on Mahle’s reverse splits: Since 2020, the right-hander has been decidedly better against left-handed hitters. While Mahle said last month that the splitter remains a work in progress, his confidence in his slider has increased. Mahle changed his slider grip and his approach to the pitch. Whereas before, Mahle tried to”throw the s—-” out of his slider, now he treats it as a finesse pitch. He’s hopeful his first trip for outside help pays off. “I think we’re on the right track,” Mahle said. “Just building confidence in the (split) because before it’s like kind of just do it on my own and I get to spring training and it’s just like, ‘Let’s see how it is.’ And then it’s too late, you know? And I don’t really know what I’m doing by myself, you know? I mean, I know what I’m doing, but it’s like those guys are professionals at pitch shaping and doing this. Seeking help gives me a lot of confidence in what I’m doing.” A veteran of the Driveline experience, Thielbar had enough confidence in what he’s done to limit his stay in Seattle to two days compared with Ryan and Jax, who were there for a week. In his previous trips, Driveline helped Thielbar develop a nasty slider and cleaned up his delivery by aligning his hips. Thielbar also credits Driveline for helping him increase his average fastball velocity from 89.8 mph in 2020 to 92.8 mph last season. After a quick check-in revealed Thielbar remained on track, the veteran left Ryan and Jax behind to deal with their next-door alarm clock. “It just would start cawing … at like 6 a.m. every single day,” Jax said. “It was just frustrating. … We couldn’t do anything. But we complained. Well, we didn’t complain. But we put it into Airbnb (review).” (Top photo of Joe Ryan: Nathan Ray Seebeck / USA Today) Get all-access to exclusive stories.
