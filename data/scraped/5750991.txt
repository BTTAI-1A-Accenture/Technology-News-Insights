Here is a checklist to follow        Do you have any problem with your existing software? Instead of this            frame question like below       What are the pain points with your existing system/process/software? 2.   Ask why? Asking why always open up a lot of information. Toyota Motor Corporation describes the same as the five whys technique. It is not about simply asking for every response from a customer. Rather plan those five why’s to the subject. Here is an example from the Wiki link An example of a problem is: the vehicle will not start.  1.   Why? – The battery is dead. 2.   Why? – The alternator is not functioning. 3.   Why? – The alternator belt has broken. 4.   Why? – The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced. 5.   Why? – The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule.

What the customer should expect from us and when we are planning to do that.  I hope these techniques will help to collect the most important information from the customer and come up with the best solution for the customer's pain points.
