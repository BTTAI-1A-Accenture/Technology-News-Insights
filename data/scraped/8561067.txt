Valicor Environmental Services, a large provider of non-hazardous wastewater treatment and recycling services, today announced it has acquired Usher Oil, a centralized wastewater treatment facility founded in 1930 in Detroit. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Usher Oil, a fourth-generation family-owned and managed business, is a provider of liquid industrial waste treatment. The company specializes in chemical, oxidation, and precipitation treatment techniques, provides waste conversion services in the region, and has more than 450,000 square feet of industrial facilities.

Valicor is based in Monroe, Ohio, located roughly halfway between Dayton and Cincinnati. âWeâre pleased to continue our trajectory of growth with the acquisition of Usher Oil and our new partnership with the Usher family,â says Steve Hopper, CEO of Valicor. âValicor has long admired the pioneering spirit, customer-centric approach, and commitment to environmental stewardship that are ingrained in Usherâs business.
