CheapCaribbean Vacations unveiled the Budget Beach Finder. This innovative trip planning tool aims to streamline and economize the process of booking the ideal beach getaway. The app boasts three key features: an interactive deal calendar, a comprehensive deal map and a customizable search option. The tool offers a user-friendly approach for beach enthusiasts to compare and secure all-inclusive vacation packages. These packages provide a diverse range of destinations, ensuring optimal value for their cherished moments. “CheapCaribbean is the go-to destination for vacation deals, and we recognize that today’s travelers are particularly focused on finding vacation packages that provide exceptional value,” said Michael Lowery, who is the Head of Global Consumer Business at Apple Leisure Group Vacations. “Our commitment to offering the best prices remains unwavering. Through the launch of the new Budget Beach Finder, we are simplifying the search process, enabling travelers to swiftly uncover incredible deals across various destinations in a single, efficient search.” Tailored to cater to every traveler’s needs, the Budget Beach Finder introduces three distinct features that reveal unparalleled prices. Travelers can identify options that align with their financial considerations. They can use multiple features designed to facilitate the discovery of budget-friendly vacation packages. For travelers seeking the finest options at competitive prices from their nearest major airport, the “Browse Everything” feature is the answer. The budget filter allows users to peruse trips within their desired price range. This eliminates the need for exhaustive individual searches for each potential destination, allowing users to explore all destination deals concurrently. Subsequent searches are based on factors, like resort star rating and duration of stay. Travelers with flexible vacation timing and an eagerness to unearth premier beach deals can utilize the price calendar for their search. Ideal for those interested in last-minute deals, the calendar showcases the best offers within the upcoming 90 days. Results are presented in an accessible price calendar format, expediting the identification of optimal deals. Advanced filters enable users to narrow down outcomes based on destination, hotel class, duration of stay and thematic preferences. The interactive map displays the array of destinations accessible through CheapCaribbean Vacations. This map comes along with comprehensive vacation package prices for featured resorts, promising maximum beach enjoyment for every dollar spent. Application of various filters streamlines the search process, facilitating the discovery of the most suitable resort deal. Engaging with the map empowers travelers to envision themselves basking on azure shorelines. It encourages them to identify the deal that resonates with their desires. “Vacation planning can be a daunting task, and our aim is to simplify the process for travelers to plan their well-deserved getaways effortlessly,” stated Dana Studebaker, Vice President of Marketing, Consumer Brands at Apple Leisure Group Vacations. “We aspire that this tool, coupled with our competitive prices, will inspire travelers to embark on more journeys and experience new destinations, brimming with endless ‘woohoo’ moments.” New Orleans Pelicans star Zion Williamson appears to have lost notable weight during the offseason, based on photos taken at his basketball camp in South Carolina. Michael Penix Jr. is done for the preseason, Raheem Morris said. Mike Tyson had little interest in trash-talking or insulting Jake Paul during the press conference for their Nov. 15 fight on Netflix. Friday’s collapse marks the seventh home to be swept into the ocean in the last four years. Russell Wilson got his first preseason start after being held out last week. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others. The Broncos had to be thrilled with what they saw from Bo Nix. In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  De-aging has been more common, as filmmakers try to simulate a younger Harrison Ford in “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” a younger Will Smith in “Gemini Man,” or a younger Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in “The Irishman.” There are a lot of myths out there when it comes to washing your hair. It's time to set the record straight. A handy Yahoo News guide to the 2024 map.
