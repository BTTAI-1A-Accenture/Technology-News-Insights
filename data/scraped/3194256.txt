Week 4 of the NFL season is here. Woohoo! That’s right, we’ve got another regular-season slate of NFL football coming our way. And maybe you’ve carved out your week and weekend to watch all the action. But perhaps you only have your choice of a few games to watch. Fear not! This weekly feature will help you navigate through all the action and find the games you really should watch this week. Like with our team watchability rankings, we’re giving you the most watchable contests, ranked by how much you should tune in. Here’s the best of the best for Week 4 (all times Eastern): (AP Photo/Reed Hoffmann) A primetime game involving NFC North rivals who are both playing well, with plenty of balance on both sides of the ball. I’m in! (AP Photo/Adam Hunger) See above — divisional rivals, balanced squads and getting to watch Lamar Jackson. All good reasons to tune in. (AP Photo/Gary McCullough) YAY MORNING FOOTBALL! But also, a matchup to watch to see if the Jags are really that bad, or if the Falcons are really that good. (AP Photo/Ed Zurga) Why are we tuning in to watch Zach Wilson possibly get trounced in primetime? Oh. Taylor Swift might be there. The ratings are going to explode. David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports I don’t think the Dolphins are going to put up 70 points again, but this is absolutely the must-watch game between the two AFC East rivals.
