   Date (MENAFN- PRLog)  -- Kansas City-based GL Investments Hospitality Division has acquired and completed an extensive renovation and rebranding of the Former Best Western Seville Plaza Hotel. GLI purchased the property in August of 2019 but renovations and re-branding were delayed due to the pandemic. The renovation of the 1985-built property encompassed new guestroom finishings, including carpet, paint, lighting, window treatments, bedding and artwork. The hotel is now a Wyndham Trademark Collection Hotel.In addition to the guest room improvements, the lobby was completely updated with new seating, lighting, artwork, flooring and front doors. The parking lot was resurfaced and top-of-the-line Google Fiber powered Wi-Fi was added to the entire complex. Finally, the breakfast area was reworked to increase seating and the hallways were refinished.This hotel has been staple for KC visitors for years, and we needed to update it and re-brand it.," said Doug Gamble, a GLI partner. "Most exciting though, is the coming streetcar extension which will have a stop directly in front of the hotel. Good times are ahead".
