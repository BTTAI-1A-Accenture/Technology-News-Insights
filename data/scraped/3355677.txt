Summer is rapidly dwindling down, but thankfully, the plethora of new movies and TV shows to binge on Netflix is not. Fans of romantic dramas will be happy to know that season 5 of the streamer's Virgin River debuts its first episodes Sept. 7. The new season is said to find Mel adjusting to a different pace of life, Jack working to grow his business, and the town facing new threats as secrets begin to surface in Virgin River. For those who want to start in on spooky season a tad early, Jaws and all of its many unnecessary sequels are hitting Netflix for your viewing pleasure at the top of the month. But, for those looking for something a bit more comedic, Anchorman and Anchorman 2 drop on the streamer Sept. 5. Other comedies coming this month include Miss Congeniality, Couples Retreat, Superbad, and more. On the Netflix Originals side of things, be sure to check out the final season of Sex Education on Sept. 21, Love Is Blind season 5 on Sept. 22, and many more. See the full list of movies and TV shows coming to Netflix in September, below.

Michael Penix Jr. is done for the preseason, Raheem Morris said. Mike Tyson had little interest in trash-talking or insulting Jake Paul during the press conference for their Nov. 15 fight on Netflix. Friday’s collapse marks the seventh home to be swept into the ocean in the last four years. The stylish star went big on black and white for her collection of dishes, decor and more with housewares brand Hudson Grace. Russell Wilson got his first preseason start after being held out last week. In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. Who will take over coaching Team USA for the Los Angeles Olympics? iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others. Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck sees the company's Neutron rocket as "the last piece of the puzzle" in its ongoing quest to build out an end-to-end space company. He says it's also poised to threaten the lead Elon Musk's SpaceX has in the market.
