Updated: July 25, 2024 Like other sub-sectors in the education app market, skills and online training courses experienced significant growth at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, as many people lost jobs or were temporarily out of work. This growth has continued post-pandemic. Online course apps have tapped into the demand for re-skilling and upskilling workers in the face of skill shortages and huge market shifts. Employers are able to create their own programmes to train employees in job-specific skills through apps such as Udemy and Coursera, while job-seekers can work on their employability by taking expert courses on LinkedIn Learning. Much of the growth of the online course sector stems from mass open online courses. Students are able to study free or paid courses flexibly, at their own pace and fully remotely, while in some cases earning certifications. While these courses were originally provided by universities and other academic bodies, the role of professors in the active running of classes has been scaled back.- Advertisement - Apps which teach coding and programming specifically also attract significant revenue and attention. The programming sector is expanding, and with it more people are undergoing training to fill the job shortages. One of the top programming apps, Mimo, offers beginners courses in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and other coding languages which are attractive to potential employers. Despite their pandemic popularity, online course sector businesses are still struggling to turn a profit. Udemy has recorded net losses each year since its public listing, Coursera lost $175 million in 2022 and despite being India’s most valuable start-up, BYJU’S is only now shifting its focus to profitable growth. Online course apps have become more integrated into workers’ career progression as the sector has moved further from academia and closer to the world of work, seeking to meet demand as it emerges. We have collected data and statistics on the online courses sector. Read on below to find out more.
