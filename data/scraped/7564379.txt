 Actress and model Andie MacDowell has always been recognized for her striking looks. On Friday the 64-year-old was celebrated at the Hollywood Beauty Awards for her effortless glow as the recipient of the Timeless Beauty Award. MacDowell stunned in a Fendi gown and let her hair do the talking. The "Groundhog Day" actress has embraced her graying locks, revealing it's a choice she is "comfortable" with. "It's something that I've wanted to do for a while. And I'm really comfortable with where I am right now in my life, and I just want to embrace the time where I am and be as real and honest as I can, not only with everybody else but also with myself," she told ET of her appearance.  MacDowell spoke candidly of how she has maintained her legacy as a timeless beauty.

"One thing I forgot to talk about in that [acceptance] speech is the intense amount of love that you feel because so many other things fall away that don't matter to you as much. And so you have a bigger opportunity to have a larger heart and compassionate love and empathy for all kinds of different people. So, it's not like I'm searching for a relationship. Like, I could have a great friendship with you and be very fulfilled with the compassion and love that I could feel for you, or other people.
