The average net worth of an American is roughly $192,700, but looking at the average net worth by age, educational attainment, and race reveals a more complicated picture. That's according to data collected in 2022 and published in 2023 by the Federal Reserve. This is the most recent data available. Unsurprisingly, older Americans tend to have higher net worths -- also known simply as "wealth" -- than younger Americans. Those with a college degree also have significantly higher net worths than those without one. Net worth is also heavily stratified by race. The average net worth of white Americans is roughly six times higher than the median net worth of Black Americans and nearly five times higher than that of Hispanic Americans. Net worth is the value of assets you control minus your liabilities. The former includes anything that can be turned into cash, such as your house, other real estate, car, investments, and bank accounts. The latter includes outstanding obligations, such as loans, mortgages, and credit card debt. Understanding your wealth and how it compares to the average net worth can provide a clearer picture of your financial well-being and identify areas that may benefit from improvement. It can also be a big help when you're figuring out how much money you need to retire. The median net worth of Americans in 2022 was $192,700, according to the Federal Reserve. That's a $51,555 increase from 2019, roughly a 37% jump and the largest recorded since the Fed began collecting this data in 1989. (Data is in 2022 dollars.)  Before you put down your hard-earned cash, consider your investment style. Getting rich sounds great, but how do you do it? We all want to meet our financial goals. To do so, should you save or invest? Multiple index funds track the S&P 500. Which ones are the best investments for you? In 2022, the median net worth of Americans younger than 35 was $39,040, while the median net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 was $410,000. Americans at retirement age had a median wealth 10.5 times that of those in the younger-than-35 age group. The average American net worth picks up after age 35. Americans between 35 and 44 years old had a median net worth of $135,300, three-and-a-half times more than those younger than 35. The gap in net worth between Americans in their late 40s and early 50s and those in their late 50s and early 60s is similar in size. Americans aged 45 to 54 had a median net worth of $246,700, and Americans aged 55 to 64 had a median net worth of $364,270. Americans aged 65 to 74 had the highest median net worth at $410,000. Net worth drops off for Americans 75 and older, whose median net worth was $334,700 as they dip into retirement savings. In 2022, the median net worth of Americans with a college degree was $464,400. Meanwhile, the median net worth of Americans with a high school diploma was $107,000, or about a quarter of the net worth of those with a college degree. Americans with no high school diploma had a median net worth of $38,050 in 2022. The median wealth of Americans without a college degree has recovered more slowly since the 2008 recession than the median net worth of those with a college degree.  In 2022, the median net worth of white Americans was $284,310. The median net worth of Black Americans and Hispanic Americans was more than $200,000 less than that. The median net worth of Black Americans in 2022 was $44,100, and the median wealth of Hispanic Americans was $62,120. These figures parallel those of average household income and asset ownership -- white households earn more and are more likely to own a home or other valuable assets than Black and Hispanic Americans. Asian families had the highest median net worth in 2022 at $535,400. The Fed had not previously reported on Asian households in its Survey of Consumer Finances.  Net worth isn't the only way to judge financial wellbeing, but taking steps to increase your wealth can be beneficial. The more personal capital you have available, the better off you'll be.
