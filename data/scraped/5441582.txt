 Artificial intelligence is already making waves across several industries. In this week's deep-dive, we look at some of the impacts of Artificial Intelligence on the legal sector. Artificial intelligence has already made an impact on the legal sector, with many tools readily available to improve lawyer efficiency. It is unlikely that AI will replace lawyers completely, but the tools available will help lawyers to manage large client workloads more efficiently. Here are two companies that are using AI to shake up the law industry:  Donotpay is hailed as the world's first robot lawyer, an AI tool specifically designed to tackle parking tickets, cancel subscriptions and negotiate bills, without the need to engage with customer services. One of the key issues Donotpay addresses is the lack of legal assistance for a significant number of civil legal battles in the United States. A report in 2022 revealed that 63% to 70% of the 1.9 million civil cases in America did not receive any legal aid. Given that the legal process can be daunting, time-consuming, and expensive, many individuals find it impractical to pursue their cases further. This is where Donotpay excels by simplifying the legal process and empowering consumers to pursue their legal battles. Donotpay offers several ways to assist consumers. For example, it helps users obtain refunds from platforms like Uber Eats (yes, they make that many mistakes, we need an app to challenge them). It also speeds up the refund process for cancelled orders on Amazon. Users can even utilise the app to initiate legal action against companies or individuals through small claims courts, aided by machine learning technology that identifies crucial clauses in contracts and terms and conditions. However, it is worth noting that Donotpay faced legal consequences earlier this year due to allegations of misleading customers and practicing law without a license.  Despite this setback, Donotpay's application of AI for legal services demonstrates the potential to make legal assistance more accessible to individuals who may not have the financial means to afford traditional legal services.  Spellbook is an AI-powered tool designed to assist lawyers and legal professionals in their work. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of GPT4, Spellbook enables legal professionals to accelerate the contract drafting process, allowing them to generate contracts and legal documents up to 10 times faster than traditional methods. A testament to their efficiency, Spellbook's rapid-response website chatbot showcases the capabilities of their tool. When enquiring about the functionality of Spellbook, the chatbot promptly responds by highlighting features tailored for the legal field, such as: "Missing Clause Review", "Directed Draft", "Find Conflicting Terms" and "Missing Boilerplate". As part of their commitment to advancing legal education, Spellbook has launched a free educational AI access program available to law students worldwide. The program aims to empower law schools to pioneer the integration of AI into legal coursework, enriching students' legal education and equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate the evolving landscape of AI in the legal industry.  It's fair to say that AI is making a huge impact across all industries, and the legal sector is no exception. AI is playing an increasingly important role in improving the accessibility of legal services for people who require legal advice and will continue to streamline specific tasks for lawyers, enabling them to handle larger work loads and improve efficiency.  **To keep ahead of the curve with weekly insights, subscribe to this newsletter and hear more about companies who are making a positive impact using technology to make services accessible to many.**  *Follow my new weekly insight newsletter on Substack here.*
