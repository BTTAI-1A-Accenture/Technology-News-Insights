Navistar has launched the International S13 Integrated Powertrain for the vocational market. The S13 Integrated Powertrain was developed in collaboration with the Traton Group. The launch expands upon the current S13 Integrated Powertrain customer offering. Navistar first introduced the S13 Integrated Powertrain for the on-highway market in August 2022, available in the International LT and RH Series models.

According to Mark Stasell, vice president, vocational truck business, Navistar, the S13 Integrated Powertrain is the most advanced the company has ever produced. Additionally, the company claims to have produced the lightest powertrain available on the market.
The S13 Integrated Powertrain consists of three distinct components – an engine, a transmission and an aftertreatment system – all designed and developed concurrently to ensure maximized compatibility and integration between systems.
According to the company, the 13-liter International S13 engine achieves advanced fuel efficiency and performance through a clean-burn combustion strategy and a reduction of friction and pumping losses. The S13 engine is Navistar’s first engine designed with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology as the primary emissions reduction technology, the company notes. The absence of an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) cooler on this engine allows for nearly 100% of exhaust to flow to the fixed geometry turbocharger. Additionally, Navistar states that the engine operates on low revolutions and high torque which equates to fewer fuel injections and less fuel consumption, delivering up to 515 horsepower and 1,850 lb-ft of torque.
The compact design of the Dual Stage Aftertreatment is purpose-built, the company notes, with easy access for serviceability, as well as improved emissions control and fuel efficiency. As per the recent press release, to keep temperatures at an optimal range and extend service intervals, the aftertreatment system includes a dual-stage SCR catalyst system in a one-box design.
The company says the International T14 Transmission can best be described as a 14-speed automated manual transmission (AMT). According to Navistar, it combines the transmission’s low range and six reverse gears through the use of a planetary gear set. The T14 combines two deep crawler gears and a wide 26.7 overall ratio to provide slow-speed maneuverability, enhanced startability and performance running to and from the job site.
The T14 Transmission features vocational-specific drive modes including off-road mode, manual mode and paver mode. As part of the clean sheet design, shifting logic and integrated software controls maximize performance resulting in gear shifting that is perfectly matched to engine revolutions. The T14 also uses an electronic clutch actuator with controls integrated into the engine to deliver faster, smoother shifting, the company notes.
Navistar says that multiple spec’ing options are available for various vocational customer applications including front-engine power take-off (FEPTO), rear-engine power take-off (REPTO) as well as single and dual output transmission PTOs.
The company says the International S13 Integrated Powertrain includes several customer benefits outside of the product itself, including dealer-integrated software, built-in service products and repair maintenance contracts.
Navistar’s connected solution, OnCommand Connection (OCC), is said to come standard on all International vehicles including those equipped with the S13 Integrated Powertrain. OCC combined with International 360 provides fleet monitoring and preventive maintenance scheduling to increase uptime and keep customers’ businesses operating at maximum efficiency. Customers can also utilize the OCC Go mobile app to monitor their vehicles in real time.
When spec’d for vocational applications, the S13 Engine and Dual Stage Aftertreatment system comes standard with a two-year, unlimited miles and unlimited hours warranty, and the T14 Transmission and factory-installed PTOs feature a three-year, unlimited miles warranty. A selection of additional warranties and extended service contracts are also available.
