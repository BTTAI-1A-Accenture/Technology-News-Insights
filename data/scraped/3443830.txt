Outsourcing lead generation drives 43% better results than in-house lead generation, as shared by Cleverly. It is why Monterail, a Poland-based software development agency, looked for an online alternative to simplify its lead generation process and connect them with potential clients.     Hence, they decided to join the DesignRush Marketplace for better chances of getting quality leads. And they were successful in doing so. According to Blazej Cepil, digital marketing lead at Monterail, the Marketplace seemed like a good alternative because of the chance to bid on projects, a unique feature not found in other industry-relevant directories. “The Marketplace seemed like a good alternative for the more popular directories of software development agencies,” said Cepil. “With the directories, you need a passive approach — after you publish your company's profile, the most you can do is optimize it and wait for results. With bidding, you have more control, I feel. Yes, there's a monthly fee to be a part of the Marketplace, but it's lower than the most popular directories, and then you can decide how much you want to bid for a given lead and if it's a fit.” Monterail subscribed to the Marketplace in September 2022, and since then, the company got connected to three projects: Cepil believes the process of connecting with leads from DesignRush is smooth and the service itself is convenient and streamlined. About DesignRush: DesignRush.com is a B2B marketplace connecting businesses with agencies through expert reviews and agency ranking lists, awards, knowledge resources, and personalized agency recommendations for vetted projects. 

 It's great to see how Monterail was able to successfully connect with quality leads through DesignRush's Marketplace. Outsourcing lead generation can be a smart strategy for businesses looking to streamline their processes and focus on their core competencies. The unique feature of bidding on projects in the DesignRush Marketplace provides a level of control and flexibility that can be hard to find in other directories or platforms. Monterail's experience with DesignRush shows how this approach can lead to meaningful connections and opportunities for growth.
Another effective strategy for lead generation is to focus on building strong relationships with existing clients and leveraging those relationships to expand your network. This can be done by providing exceptional service and going above and beyond to meet the needs and expectations of your clients. By doing so, you can increase the likelihood that they will recommend you to others or even bring you new business directly. Additionally, consider offering referral incentives to incentivize current clients to refer others to your business. This approach can be highly effective and doesn't require a significant investment in advertising or marketing campaigns.  Top realtors and industry influencers.
