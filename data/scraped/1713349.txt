Ivy+ IT Academy classes will be free or low-cost. 
	Ivy Tech Community College will launch a new program this month called the Ivy+ IT Academy. The goal is to provide Hoosiers with IT skills and certificates needed for a career in the tech industry. 
	It’s part of a partnership with TechPoint, a local nonprofit that works to expand tech workforce across the state. 
	Matthew Etchison is the chief information officer with Ivy Tech. He said the academy will offer applicable tech skills that aren’t often taught in other programs. 
	“Traditionally, people go to school, and they get a degree in it, which is great and we certainly encourage that,” Etchison said. “But a lot of times people already have a degree and they want to get into it or they want to make a career pivot.” 
	He said strengthening the state’s tech industry will benefit the economy. 
	“We like to say that every company is a tech company,” Etchison said. “You'll rarely find any organization or company that doesn't have tech or IT needs.” 
	The classes are meant to give students the skills they need on an expedited timeline. Etchison said they will be low-cost or entirely free. 
	The program will launch at Ivy Tech’s Muncie campus on March 13 and statewide at the end of the month.
