A serial fintech entrepreneur, the Rand Afrikaans University IT graduate set up and sold on two other payment companies before founding Zilch in 2018. It raced to a $2 billion valuation in just two years, offering a transparent approach to buy-now-pay later services. Belamant’s experience in providing payment platforms in emerging markets – he helped Uber with a method of moving cash onto Mastercard accounts that took the ride-hailing app up a gear there – gave Zilch an edge. His own path began in a childhood spent in his father Serge’s Johannesburg office, where Belamant senior set up NET1 UEPS, to open channels for transactions between businesses and people without formal banking facilities.
