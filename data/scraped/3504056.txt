The Agricultural Price Index (API) is a monthly publication that measures the price changes in agricultural outputs and inputs for the UK. The output series reflects the price farmers receive for their products (referred to as the farm-gate price). Information is collected for all major crops (for example wheat and potatoes) and on livestock and livestock products (for example sheep, milk and eggs). The input series reflects the price farmers pay for goods and services. This is split into two groups: goods and services currently consumed; and goods and services contributing to investment. Goods and services currently consumed refer to items that are used up in the production process, for example fertiliser, or seed. Goods and services contributing to investment relate to items that are required but not consumed in the production process, such as tractors or buildings. A price index is a way of measuring relative price changes compared to a reference point or base year which is given a value of 100. The year used as the base year needs to be updated over time to reflect changing market trends. The latest data are presented with a base year of 2020 = 100. To maintain continuity with the current API time series, the UK continues to use standardised methodology adopted across the EU. Details of this internationally recognised methodology are described in the Handbook for EU agricultural price statistics.
Please note: The historical time series with base years 2000 = 100, 2005 = 100, 2010 = 100 and 2015 = 100 are not updated monthly and presented for archive purposes only.  Each file gives the date the series was last updated. For those commodities where farm-gate prices are currently unavailable we use the best proxy data that are available (for example wholesale prices). Similarly, calculations are based on UK prices where possible but sometimes we cannot obtain these. In such cases prices for Great Britain, England and Wales or England are used instead. The content of the publication has been produced to comply with accessibility standards WCAG2.1 in two formats, Portable Document Format (pdf) and Open Document Text (odt). The odt file allows you to make changes such as the size of the text and the colours used in images or charts. Next update: see the statistics release calendar. Defra statistics: prices
