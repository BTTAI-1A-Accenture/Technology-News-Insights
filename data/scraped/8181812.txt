 Poetry is one of the oldest and most universal forms of human expression. It has been used to convey emotions, stories, beliefs, and values across cultures and time periods. But what happens when poetry meets technology? How do poets use algorithms, data, and machine learning to create new forms of expression that challenge and expand our understanding of poetry? In this article, I will explore how poets use algorithms, data, and machine learning to create new forms of expression that are not only innovative but also authentic, meaningful, and engaging. I will also discuss some of the benefits and challenges of using technology as a poetic tool, as well as some of the ethical and aesthetic implications of this emerging genre. I will divide the article into four sections, each covering a different aspect or example of how poets use algorithms, data, and machine learning to create new forms of expression:   Algorithmic poetry is poetry that is generated or influenced by a set of rules or procedures that are executed by a computer or a human. It can be based on existing texts, such as found poetry or remix poetry, or on original words or phrases, such as generative poetry or code poetry. Algorithmic poetry can be seen as a form of experimentation and exploration of the possibilities and limitations of language, logic, and creativity. It can also be seen as a form of collaboration and interaction between the poet, the algorithm, and the reader. Some of the benefits of algorithmic poetry are: Some of the challenges of algorithmic poetry are: Here are some examples of algorithmic poetry and how they use algorithms to create poetic effects: Pentametron is an art project by Ranjit Bhatnagar that mines Twitter for tweets in iambic pentameter and pairs them into rhyming couplets. The result is a stream of unexpected and often humorous juxtapositions that reveal the poetic potential of everyday language. For example:  The algorithm behind Pentametron works as follows: Pentametron uses an algorithm to create poetic effects such as: Taroko Gorge is a generative poem by Nick Montfort that creates an endless sequence of verses based on a vocabulary related to nature. The poem uses a simple algorithm that randomly selects words from different lists and arranges them into lines according to a predefined structure. The result is a minimalist and meditative poem that evokes the beauty and diversity of nature. For example:  The algorithm behind Taroko Gorge works as follows: Taroko Gorge uses an algorithm to create poetic effects such as:   Data poetry is poetry that uses data as a source or a medium for poetic expression. It can be based on numerical data, such as statistics or measurements, or on textual data, such as social media posts or news articles. It can also use data visualization techniques, such as graphs or charts, to present or enhance the poetic message. Data poetry can be seen as a form of exploration and communication of the meaning and value of data, as well as a form of critique and reflection on the impact and implications of data in our society. It can also be seen as a form of collaboration and interaction between the poet, the data, and the reader. Some of the benefits of data poetry are: Some of the challenges of data poetry are: Here are some examples of data poetry and how they use data to create poetic effects: Say Their Names! is a web-based work by John Barber that generates a list from more than 5,000 names of Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans who have been killed by police officers in the United States from 2015 to the present day. Each name is spoken by a computerized voice in a random order. The result is a powerful and poignant poem that exposes the scale and impact of racial violence in America. The data behind Say Their Names! comes from several sources, such as The Washington Post’s Fatal Force database , The Guardian’s The Counted project , and Mapping Police Violence . The data includes information such as the name, age, gender, race, date, location, cause, and circumstance of each death. Say Their Names! uses data to create poetic effects such as: Instapoetry is a phenomenon that involves posting short poems on Instagram accompanied by images or videos. Instapoetry uses data in the form of hashtags, likes, comments, and followers to reach a large and diverse audience online. Instapoetry also uses data to create poetic effects, such as using emojis, fonts, colors, and layouts to convey tone, mood, and style. Some of the most popular Instapoets are Rupi Kaur , Lang Leav , and Atticus . The data behind Instapoetry comes from Instagram’s platform , which allows users to share photos and videos with filters, stickers, captions, hashtags, locations, tags, stories, reels, live streams, direct messages, comments, likes, saves, follows, insights, ads, shops, guides, reels remixes etc. The data includes information such as the number of posts, followers, likes etc. Instapoetry uses data to create poetic effects such as:   Machine learning poetry is poetry that is generated or influenced by a machine learning model, such as a neural network or a natural language processing system. Machine learning models are trained on large datasets of texts, such as poems, novels, or lyrics, and learn to produce new texts that mimic the style, structure, and content of the original texts. Machine learning poetry can be seen as a form of experimentation and exploration of the possibilities and limitations of artificial intelligence, as well as a form of collaboration and interaction between the poet, the machine, and the reader. Some of the benefits of machine learning poetry are: Some of the challenges of machine learning poetry are: Here are some examples of machine learning poetry and how they use machine learning to create poetic effects: Deep-speare is a neural network that was trained on 2,600 poems by Shakespeare and other poets. Deep-speare can generate new sonnets that follow the rhyme scheme and meter of Shakespearean sonnets, as well as use metaphors, imagery, and wordplay. The result is a convincing and creative imitation of Shakespeare’s style. For example:  The machine learning model behind Deep-speare works as follows: Deep-speare uses machine learning to create poetic effects such as: Poem Generator is a natural language processing system that can generate poems based on user input. The user can choose from different types of poems, such as haiku, limerick, or free verse, and provide some keywords or phrases to guide the generation process. The result is a customized and original poem that reflects the user’s preferences and interests. For example:  The natural language processing system behind Poem Generator works as follows: Poem Generator uses natural language processing to create poetic effects such as:   In this article, I have explored how poets use algorithms, data, and machine learning to create new forms of expression that are not only innovative but also authentic, meaningful, and engaging. I have shown how these technologies enable poets to experiment with different sources, mediums, and styles of poetry, as well as to reach new audiences and contexts. I have also discussed some of the benefits and challenges of using technology as a poetic tool, such as enhancing creativity, diversity, and accessibility, but also raising ethical and aesthetic questions about authorship, authenticity, and quality. Technology is changing the way we make and experience poetry. But what does this mean for the future of poetry? How will technology affect our understanding and appreciation of poetic expression? How will poets adapt and respond to the opportunities and challenges posed by technology? These are some of the questions that we need to ask ourselves as we enter a new era of poetic innovation. But these questions are not only relevant for poets. They are also relevant for anyone who cares about the power and beauty of language, the role and value of creativity, and the impact and responsibility of technology in our society. We are all poets in some way, whether we write poems or not. We all use language to express ourselves, to communicate with others, to shape our reality. We all have the potential to create something new, original, and meaningful with our words. We all have the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with technology to enhance our expression. Therefore, I invite you to join me in this journey of discovering the art of poetry in the age of technology. I invite you to read more poems that use algorithms, data, and machine learning to create new forms of expression. I invite you to write your own poems using these technologies or any other tools that inspire you. I invite you to share your poems with others on Linkedin or any other platform that suits you. I invite you to comment on this article or any other article that sparks your interest or curiosity.
