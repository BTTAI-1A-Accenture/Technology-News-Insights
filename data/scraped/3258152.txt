     FOX News’ Jennifer Griffin reports on how the potential government shutdown would impact the Department of Defense as well as U.S. foreign policy interests. Lawmakers are moving to protect U.S. troops’ pay as the clock ticks toward a potential government shutdown this weekend.  "We put provisions not just for active duty, it’s also for [Department of Defense] civilians and contractors, and for Coast Guard, so that they would get a paycheck no matter what happened," Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., a Navy veteran who is leading the measure in the House, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Wednesday.  "Obviously, we want to not shut the government down and that is something that we are still working hard late into the night to get done," Kiggans said. "But God forbid that doesn't happen, we need to have… that reassurance for people, a group of people that I care very passionately about and that the country needs to be prioritizing, and that's our military." Disagreements in the House and Senate over how to proceed with funding the government past the Sept. 30 fiscal year deadline are making lawmakers increasingly concerned about potential fallout. HERE'S HOW HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO FORCE BIDEN'S HAND ON BORDER SECURITY A group of the 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers from the USA seen taking a minute of silence during the ceremony. At the Waal Crossing Memorial (Waaloversteek-monument), a solemn ceremony took place to commemorate the heroic crossing of the Waal River by American soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division, during the Operation, which took place 79 years ago.   If the government shuts down without a defense funding bill in place — which has yet to pass in the House or Senate — members of the Armed Forces as well as non-military Pentagon staff will not get paychecks until funding is resolved. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told CNN on Tuesday that over one million troops and non-military personnel could go without pay until the government is funded. "It's just becoming almost, I think of it as almost like a political game. And using the military to play a game with that as a political pawn is certainly not right," Kiggans said. CONGRESS RETURNS TO DC WITH FIVE DAYS TO AVERT A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., is moving to ensure troops are paid in the event of a government shutdown  Kiggans, whose district has a heavy military presence, introduced the bill on Thursday night. It’s since seen bipartisan support. Her legislation is a companion bill to one being led by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, in the Senate.  But in those six days, Congress has not made much meaningful progress toward averting a shutdown. Asked if she was more worried now than before, Kiggans said bluntly: "It changes every 15 minutes."

"We're still very, very focused on what we're doing to ensure that funding doesn't stop. But if it did, God forbid, yes, we are next in line," Kiggans said.

That includes the defense spending bill, which some hardliners oppose over $300 million allocated to Ukraine among its provisions. On the eve of a 16-day government shutdown in 2013, lawmakers scrambled to pass legislation to keep troops paid for its duration, according to the Military Times.
