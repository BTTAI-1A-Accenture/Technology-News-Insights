Cristiano Ronaldo is currently earning $125 million more than any other player in world soccer. That is according to Forbes, who published a list of the 11 highest-paid soccer players this week. The list estimates how much each of those 11 players is expected to earn in 2023, both in terms of payments from their teams and off-field income, such as sponsorship deals. Ronaldo can apparently expect to bank $260m by the end of the year, with $200m of that coming directly from his club, Al Nassr.

Forbes explained: "Ronaldo's new Saudi employers haven't been shy about taking advantage of his prowess as a celebrity pitchman. "He appeared in a video posted by Al Nassr, wearing traditional Saudi attire, to promote the Kingdom's National Day, as well as one for the upcoming Tyson Fury vs Francis Ngannou boxing match in Riyadh. "He's also continued to plug his own partnerships, with spots for Clear, Herbalife and Binance, among others, appearing on his Instagram account over the past two months." Second behind Ronaldo on the list is Inter Miami captain Lionel Messi.

However, Messi - who rejected a move to Saudi Arabia earlier this year when he turned down an offer from Al-Hilal - is making more than his great rival when it comes to off-field income. Neymar, after saying yes to Al-Hilal in August - is third on the list, ahead of Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe in fourth. Another Saudi-based player is fifth in the shape of Al-Ittihad captain Karim Benzema. A list of the 11 highest-paid soccer players in 2023, according to Forbes. 1.
