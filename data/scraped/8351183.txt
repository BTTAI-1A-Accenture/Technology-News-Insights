The iPhone 15 will be available beginning Friday. It introduces new features including an upgraded camera and display, an action button and a move to kill off its Lightning charging cord and replace it with the universal standard USB-C. A similar switch in charging cables was made from the 30-pin connector to Lightning more than a decade ago, releasing a concern in customers that had already invested in cables and accessories. Apple leadership made the decision to make the move to Lightning with the iPhone 5, but unlike that switch, USB-C is one of necessity. European regulation requiring USB-C is set to take effect next year, in their effort to crack down on e-waste, they mandated a common charger for mobile devices by 2024. USB-C is not a new connector for consumers with tech. Consumers charge all their gadgets with a USB-C connector, including iPads, MacBooks, gaming devices, headphones, etc. Lighting is for iPhones and AirPods.Â The move to USB-C will eventually cut out all previous versions of charging cables making it easy to carry around one cable and not many.
