     The 'Outnumbered' panel discussed allegations the Biden administration colluded with Big Tech to censor COVID-19 information. Former President Obama’s attorney general on Wednesday condemned a federal judge’s recent order limiting the Biden administration from communicating with social media companies as part of alleged government efforts to suppress First Amendment-protected free speech.  "Well this is pretty stupid. And potentially dangerous," Eric Holder, who served as U.S. attorney general from 2009-2015, tweeted Wednesday.  Holder shared a New York Times article about the decision. The opening paragraph of the Times piece claims that the ruling "could curtail efforts to combat false and misleading narratives about the coronavirus pandemic and other issues." However, those alleged government efforts to crack down on free speech are precisely what the preliminary injunction takes issue with.  BIDEN TO APPEAL BIG TECH COLLUSION RULING BANNING ADMIN OFFICIALS MEETING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA FIRMS: REPORT Then-President Obama applauds outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27, 2015.

Doughty – who was appointed by former President Trump – restricts certain Biden administration officials from meeting, emailing, calling, sending letters, texting or engaging in any communication of any kind with social media companies for the purpose of "urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of content containing protected free speech posted on social-media platforms."  The preliminary injunction, however, does not restrict Biden administration officials from communicating with social media companies on postings involving criminal activity, national security threats, or criminal efforts to suppress voting, provide illegal campaign contributions, cyber-attacks against election infrastructure, or foreign attempts to influence elections.  Sen.
