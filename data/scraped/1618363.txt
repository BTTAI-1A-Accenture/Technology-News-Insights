As the global information technology revolution heats up and more and more companies embrace Cloud computing, AI, digital marketing, automation and web technologies for their business, the information technology services sector stands to benefit in the years to come. Bloomberg Intelligence in a survey of 3,038 executives across different industries found that businesses, small and large, are expected to keep increasing their IT spend as they plan to stay ahead in the technology race. A whopping 61% of respondents in the survey said that they plan to increase their tech spending. One of the biggest areas where companies plan to increase their spending is cybersecurity as companies resolve to protect their online assets and customer data. Because of this trend, as we will see later in the article, several small and big IT services companies have started offering cybersecurity services. Another important area where companies are planning to pour their dollars is Cloud computing, where Amazon and Microsoft will continue to take the lead, according to the survey. But in addition to these Cloud giants, several IT services companies thrive because of the Cloud industry as they help businesses migrate from on-premise infrastructure to Cloud systems and maintain their operations. Some notable companies in this domain are ServiceNow, Oracle and DXC. While companies are poised to increase IT spending, the sector wasn’t immune to the inflation surge and global economic crisis that wreaked havoc on the markets in 2022 and continue to hammer small and large companies in 2023. Gartner earlier this year estimated that worldwide IT spending will reach $4.5 trillion in 2023. This shows a 2.4% growth from the previous year, but was down from Gartner’s previous growth projections of 5.1%. Spending on business software and IT was expected to account for a whopping $2.16 trillion in projected IT spending in 2023, according to Gartner. This shows that importance of IT services. Despite difficult odds companies need IT services to scale and expand their operations and even to cut costs. Consulting is another area that is thriving withing the IT services industry. The Gartner report says within IT services, spending on consulting services was expected to reach $264 billion this year, up 6.7% from 2022. Gartner said that inflation was eroding the spending capabilities of companies and causing layoffs at several B2C companies. The Gartner report shows that companies are expected to spend more on software and IT and reduce spend dollars when it comes to devices and hardware. The software and IT services segments are expected to grow 9.3% and 5.5% in 2023, respectively, according to Gartner. Given all the hullaballoo around AI, IT services companies are not silent about this new trend. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet in the company’s earnings call with analysts in March talked about Accenture’s AI initiatives: “We are continuing to use AI in the way we run our business, for example, in how we look at our accounts payable and receivables and finding ways where we can optimize to have better efficiencies there. We are using it today in the way we are delivering our consulting services as well and definitely very much so in how we look at sales and being able to predict based on lots of factors. Should we be running after the sale or not, or can we show the data that these …. is not the right kind of sale, we are not the right fit. So, we have increasingly been using AI, both in how we deliver services as well as in how we run ourselves. Of course, our SynOps platform for operations is also AI-enabled. It’s one of the reasons why clients turn to us because it’s helping them digitize faster. They are not having to build these things. So, long-term, we see these technology changes, things like generative AI is playing to our strengths because to use these technologies, it requires deep understanding of the industry, the use cases, the process changes. When people talk about the new kinds of generative AI, which we are super excited about, being like a co-pilot to human beings, the entire process has to be changed in order to make that work. You have got to up-skill the people and you have to be able to do all of that in a very responsible way.” Photo by Science in HD on Unsplash Methodology We scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 12 IT services stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies.
