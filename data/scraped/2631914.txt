Published onFebruary 27, 2023  During Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event in early February, the company revealed its plans to work on extended reality devices. Although Samsung didn’t share any details back then, a freshly filed trademark hints that its first product may be AR glasses. And another trademark suggests those glasses may be joined by a smart ring. During all the commotion at MWC 2023, Samsung appears to have filed two new trademarks at Korea’s patent and trademark office — Korean Intellectual Property Right Information Service (KIPRIS). According to Wearable, one of the trademarks is for a product called the Galaxy Ring and the other is for a product called Galaxy Glasses. This isn’t the first time Samsung tried its hand at developing a smart ring. Back in 2015, the tech giant filed a patent for a smart ring that would let you control your phone, as well as your smart home devices. The recently discovered trademark for the Galaxy Ring describes the device as a “smart device for measuring health indicators and/or sleep in the form of a ring.” Outside of that, there isn’t much else to take away from the application. As for the Galaxy Glasses, there’s even less information to go on. However, it is tagged under the classification of “headset for virtual reality experience,” “headset for augmented reality experience,” ” smart glasses,” “smart phone,” and “headphone.” Will Samsung reveal either of these devices in 2023? We’ll have to wait to find out.
