Sascha Wil­son More than a decade af­ter he sued the State for ma­li­cious pros­e­cu­tion, a Mara­bel­la man has won his ap­peal at the Privy Coun­cil and is set to re­ceive $300,000 in dam­ages.  In a judge­ment yes­ter­day, the five Law Lords unan­i­mous­ly over­turned a de­ci­sion by the Court of Ap­peal and re­stored the orig­i­nal or­der that the state pay Kevin Stu­art dam­ages for ma­li­cious pros­e­cu­tion.  Stu­art, a labour­er, was charged with be­ing a gang mem­ber dur­ing the 2011 State of Emer­gency. He was ar­rest­ed at his home around mid­night on Au­gust 27, 2011, and tak­en to the Mara­bel­la Po­lice Sta­tion. He claimed he was locked in a cell with a toi­let in the ground that was clogged and had a foul stench and was forced to sleep on the floor. Two days lat­er, PC Nicholas Phillips charged Stu­art with be­ing a gang mem­ber and he was re­mand­ed in cus­tody af­ter ap­pear­ing in court. How­ev­er, on Sep­tem­ber 28, 2011, Di­rec­tor of Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tion Roger Gas­pard dis­con­tin­ued pro­ceed­ings against Stu­art and he was re­leased from cus­tody.  On Jan­u­ary 11, 2012,  through his at­tor­ney Kevin Rati­ram, Stu­art filed a law­suit against the At­tor­ney Gen­er­al for wrong­ful ar­rest, false im­pris­on­ment, and ma­li­cious pros­e­cu­tion. He claimed the charge was laid ma­li­cious­ly and with­out rea­son­able and prob­a­ble cause.  In his wit­ness state­ment, Phillips said he was in­formed by oth­er po­lice of­fi­cers that Stu­art had been ar­rest­ed sev­er­al times for nar­cotics and gang-re­lat­ed ac­tiv­i­ties. He al­so claimed he and oth­er of­fi­cers con­duct­ed sur­veil­lance close to Stu­art’s home and in Au­gust 2011 he re­ceived in­for­ma­tion from sev­er­al in­for­mants that Stu­art had sold drugs to them, and he was a gang mem­ber.  In her rul­ing in favour of Stu­art in Ju­ly 2015, Jus­tice Joan Charles point­ed out sev­er­al in­con­sis­ten­cies in Phillips’ ev­i­dence. She found that Phillips had act­ed with mal­ice.  “The fact that this of­fi­cer through­out his tes­ti­mo­ny at­tempt­ed to but­tress, strength­en and fab­ri­cate new ev­i­dence against the claimant is a strong ba­sis for con­clud­ing that he fab­ri­cat­ed the case against the claimant and that in fact he had no rea­son­able or prob­a­ble cause to charge him,” she said. The judge award­ed Stu­art $300,000 in gen­er­al dam­ages and $50,000 in ex­em­plary dam­ages plus le­gal costs. How­ev­er, the State ap­pealed her rul­ing. On Ju­ly 25, 2017, Jus­tices of Ap­peal Nolan Bereaux, Prakash Moo­sai, and Ju­dith Jones up­held Stu­art’s claim for wrong­ful ar­rest and false im­pris­on­ment and or­dered that he re­ceive $50,000 in dam­ages but up­held the State’s ap­peal on the is­sue of ma­li­cious pros­e­cu­tion.  Stu­art then filed an ap­peal at the Privy Coun­cil where he was rep­re­sent­ed by Ernest Koy­lass SC, Rati­ram, and Deb­bie Roopc­hand, in­struct­ed by Duke Street Cham­bers.  The Law Lords found the Court of Ap­peal’s crit­i­cism of Charles for not tak­ing in­to ac­count the en­tire­ty of the ev­i­dence was mis­placed. Lord Bor­rows stat­ed: “It was clear from his cross-ex­am­i­na­tion that PC Phillips’ wit­ness state­ment was in sev­er­al re­spects in­ac­cu­rate and in­com­plete and some of his ev­i­dence was plain­ly not cred­i­ble. There was no leap, let alone a quan­tum leap, in her (Charles) rea­son­ing.”   Thomas Roe KC, in­struct­ed by Charles Rus­sel Speechlys LLP, rep­re­sent­ed the State.
