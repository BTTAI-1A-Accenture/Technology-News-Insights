Two Letters of recommendation    "The MSBA program further widened my knowledge of how technology is harnessed to continue to advance the way we live and those of future generations. I also did not just learn from the very supportive mentors of faculty professors, but I also had the privilege of knowing and learning from my much younger cohorts (1st and 2nd)." - Marife Ramos, MSBA, SPHR/PHR, SHRM-CP Min Li, PhD (916) 538-2753 Tahoe Hall - Room 2056limin@csus.edu Claire Goldsby, M.A.Admissions Coordinatorgoldsby@csus.edu(916) 278-2895 Serena Hoffman, M.S.Academic Advisorjohnss@csus.edu(916) 278-6391 Maleeha KhanExecutive Director of Graduate Programsmaleeha.khan@csus.edu(916) 278-6464 California State University, SacramentoCollege of Business Tahoe Hall, Room 10206000 J StreetSacramento, CA 95819-6088 Students will have certain capabilities (knowledge, skills, abilities) that result from your business degree program. At the Sacramento State, we call these capabilities learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are measured and analyzed through a broad range of assessments, from class assignments to standardized exams, to provide assurance of learning in the degree program. From time to time, the College of Business (COB) or your instructors may ask or require you to participate in assessments. We use the information from assessments to reinforce what is working or to make changes to support student learning and success. For example, we may revise curriculum or hire additional staff and faculty to support the needs of our students. We document how our students perform and the actions that we take to continuously improve. This process helps to enhance the student experience and maintain our external accreditation with AACSB International. Speaking of accreditation, less than 5% of business schools worldwide are accredited by AACSB and thus this elite accreditation contributes greatly to the COB reputation. We hope that when you are asked to participate in assessment activities that you will accept the invitation and put your best effort forward.
