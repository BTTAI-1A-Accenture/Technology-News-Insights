By developing a network and community of more than 600,000 members and investors, Alumni is able to rely on the strength of numbers.  When a startup begins working with Alumni Ventures, they quickly recognize the power and versatility of the network the firm has curated. From investing and supplying capital to mentoring and developing customers and interpersonal connections, startups are given all the help and tools needed to create their own success.  Alumni Ventures works as hard to develop their investors as they do their startups, realizing that both camps should represent strength in order to maintain balance. As of 2022, they have raised in excess of $1 billion in capital and resources and work with over 9,000 active investors. As a result, they have equity in more than 1,000 portfolio companies.   Hailing from the West Coast, Chaac Ventures focuses on investing in technology emanating from Southern California,  specifically Princeton University. By looking for investment opportunities in a specific area or from a particular institution, like Princeton, Chaac Ventures is able to leverage the technological ecosystem existing in and around the institution or, in this case, the university.  As a result, Chaac is able to find greater opportunities for seed and early-stage venture investments. Plus,  working in and around a thriving technology ecosystem also provides its own set of benefits and available networking for both investors and startups.  Chaac Ventures consistently creates investments within the $250,000 to $1 million range for innovative companies and ideas. Some of their more notable investments include Hiki, GoodWork, and Golden.  Investing in technology definitely requires keeping a keen eye focused on the future. At Progression Fund, one of the primary motivations for the firm is to invest in the next generation of entrepreneurs and consumers.

Currently, Millennials are more than half the workforce. Progression Fund is working to position itself as a global leader and investor in online gaming, commerce and shopping, and lifestyle marketplaces for these growing populations. One of the greatest achievements of the internet is the connectivity and communication made available for a global community. By connecting people from all over the world, our planet has metaphorically become smaller and more like a village.  Lair East Labs understands that global and international thinking and planning are the next step in our collective development, both communally and commercially. Through their accelerator programs, entrepreneurs with an eye toward international commerce are able to receive the best networking and mentoring opportunities available to help them get started.  Over a four-month period, participants will gain valuable insight into how to maximize their business through successful fundraising and deftly navigating international financial markets.  Mercuri focuses on investment possibilities in early-stage ventures, specifically in the fields of media and technology. As these two industries become increasingly intertwined, it seems only logical to leverage the innovative ideas and plans which will emerge.  At Mercuri, their central focus is on providing more meaningful content and interactions between customers and companies, facilitating better methods for these communications, and developing sustainable businesses that can remain innovative and meaningful. Through their investments in companies like Kickstarter and Decoded, they are supporting the very innovation that will also help to keep them innovative and meaningful, as well.  Often, innovation arrives after some rules are broken and the status quo is shaken a bit. Some of the greatest achievements had to defy consensus thinking before becoming more widely accepted. Left Lane Capital understands this concept well. In fact, they’ve made it part of their mission statement. They’ve also made investing in life-changing ideas a standard business practice.  With investments spanning dozens of industries, some particular standouts in their portfolio include Hello Fresh, Delivery Hero, and Trivago. Recently listed as one of GrowthCap’s top 25 Growth Equity Firms, Left Lane seems to be on the right path to continued success.   Sometimes a market for a product or idea is not as developed as the product or idea itself. It may take professionally launching a company in order to actualize the associated market or economy.  CoVenture is comprised of investors who want to help startups to grow these burgeoning markets and economic ecosystems. They look to achieve these goals by supplying capital at critical steps and pinch points, often beyond just the needs of the startup. By helping startups through financing various strategies, CoVenture is able to assist these businesses in ways they may not have realized they needed.  As a result, these young companies and entrepreneurs are able to comprehend more of the overall process for supporting and growing a startup. In turn, they’ll hopefully impart the same wisdom to others down the line. With more than a few high-profile founders and successful companies and organizations in their resumé, RSE Ventures has learned how to pick a winner. Notable standouts include the International Champions Cup, VaynerMedia, Milk Bar and Pizza, and Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.  RSE Ventures tend to focus on late-stage capital investments, in which a company or organization is positioned at a critical juncture for success or expansion and needs a helping hand. Their continued success in vaulting businesses to new heights is an exceedingly optimistic sign for their future.  Some VC firms use metrics and data as their main determinants of success. For others, the successful businesses and relationships which are forged represent the real wins. At Backed VC, the desire to see investments prosper is as important as creating long-term working relationships between investors, entrepreneurs, and founders.   Backed VC views its connections with founders to be one which will last and grow throughout the life of a company. This kind of long-term relationship from a VC firm exemplifies the commitment Backed gives to startups.  Located in London, Backed has amassed a number of European investments, but their client list truly spans the globe. As they continue to promote their ‘’put people first” ethos, it’s expected Backed VC will continue to reach valuable entrepreneurs and investments for years to come.

Crosscut Ventures is a leading VC firm stationed in Los Angeles. They are currently the largest seed-stage VC firm in LA.  By choosing Southern California instead of Silicon Valley when starting out in 2008, Crosscut was able to amass a substantial client base and help to build a strong tech startup ecosystem.  Currently, they’re managing over $300 million in assets and investments.  Companies like Fabletics, BuzzFeed, and Ipsy have all benefited from partnerships with and guidance from this firm. Expect Crosscut to keep defying the odds and making an even stronger name for themselves and LA as an international technology hub. Another Midwest-based VC firm, Chicago Ventures has been a champion of overlooked opportunities and technological possibilities for over a decade. When initially starting their journey, Chicago Ventures realized that much of the seed money available for investments tended to be concentrated in known areas of success.  It became clear that other deserving startups were around but didn’t have the right connections or communications to procure the needed funds.  By actively engaging with overlooked groups in the seed stages, strong, long-lasting partnerships are formed. These became the basis for Chicago Venture’s initial portfolio and company success. Currently, they have nearly 80 clients listed in their portfolio. Redpoint Ventures helps clients get started by offering early-stage or seed funding and keep going with late-stage and debt funding. For the past two decades, the firm has successfully partnered with entrepreneurs and founders to help them find their footing and effectively launch their dreams.  Redpoint has also effectively helped to support entrepreneurs at much later stages, in which critical funds are needed to keep a business going strong. Companies like Sonos, Draft Kings, and even Netflix have successfully partnered with Redpoint over the years, both in their infancies and as established entities. Some VC firms choose to focus on specific stages of a startup’s life cycle to dedicate their time and resources. Seed and early stages look to get companies launched, whereas late-stage investments may be more relevant for buoyancy and stability.  With Greycroft, their approach involves remaining an integral part of a company’s financial and strategic planning for the life of the company. By remaining closely engaged with the startups they invest in, the firm is able to better manage their investments’ needs, often beyond just the financial concerns.  As a result, Greycroft is able to cultivate teamwork and integrity, both within their invested companies and within their own firm. As a global leader in VC firms, their commitment to partnerships and a sustainable marketplace benefits everyone involved.

With a focus on supplying initial strength and support, this firm believes in the power of early and often interactions through networking, active outbound research, and deciphering company analytics. By aggressively pursuing early investing opportunities, Social Starts is able to produce strong and reliable returns for investors. Early investing also helps to lock in the lowest cost basis possible for the most enticing startups. As part of an initiative to support more innovative startups, Google Ventures was founded and launched in 2009. Instead of looking to fund businesses at certain stages of development, GV decided to create methods for support that started at the earliest stages of development and then followed the company through its growth for decades.  By focusing on long-term commitments and guidance, GV was able to offer support by helping to develop inclusion, equity, and diversity, adding talent, and engineering prowess to their partner companies. As a result, GV has produced successes like Nest, Slack, and Uber. Additionally, Google Ventures is able to help startups to interface with Google, providing instant access to some of the most innovative technology and expertise available.  SVA is a long-term investor who champions the potential of a powerful and versatile network for support and knowledge, coupled with the ability to provide specific support in a company’s life cycle. Referred to as inflection points, these moments of singular connections or decisions can greatly impact the trajectory of a company.  Offering comprehensive support for startups and founders is key to building long-term success. By remaining partners with these same startups for many years, sometimes decades, SVA is able to more clearly understand where a company is going and what kinds of support will be most effective.  As a result, SVA can point to some highly impressive names in its portfolio, including DoorDash, Snapchat, Twitter, and Airbnb. At First Round Capital, they make it their mission to offer support early and often. When starting out over 15 years ago, though, there was much less focus on supplying financial and organizational support. Most investments only came when companies could prove their worth or potential.  For modern investing strategies, earlier is often better. First Round Capital also understands that beyond the financial help, successful VC firms must work with and partner with the founders for everyone to achieve success. Some of First Round’s success stories include names like Warby Parker, Splice, and Roblox. Focusing on companies that thrive at the intersection of media, technology, and entertainment, Advancit Capital looks to create pathways to success, both long and short-term.

Committing to partnering for an extended amount of time also helps Advancit to develop its investments for maximum success.  Since media and technology seem to be more inextricably linked by the day, it seems as if Advancit Capital has positioned itself to remain a substantial force among VC firms.  Recently, the buzz around AI technology has seemed too great to ignore, and rightly so. Advancements in the field of AI tech are poised to transform numerous aspects of our work and personal lives.  Investments in startups that feature AI technology are also poised to become more frequent and central to technological advancement. Betaworks is one such VC firm that focuses on AI technology, as well as Web3, NLP, LLMs, and applied machine learning.  Over the years, Betaworks has invested in more than 150 forward-thinking companies. Betaworks offers services as an accelerator for startups and seed-stage funding and is currently focusing on developing conversational interfaces for social networking.
