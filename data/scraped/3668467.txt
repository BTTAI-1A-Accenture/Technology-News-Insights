It also boosted Agoura’s record to 4-0 this season, already a huge accomplishment after the team won just one game last year.“It’s big for us, for these local rivalries,” Croick said. “Nobody is thinking Agoura is going to win football games this year after going 1-9, but they believe in themselves and they believe in what we’re doing. That’s the difference this year. They truly believe in the brotherhood, that familyship is everything, and that shows.”The game had the feeling of a heavyweight boxing match, as Agoura’s Harrison Novak and Calabasas’ Alonzo Contreras combined for more than 700 passing yards and 10 touchdown passes as the teams kept hitting each other with big play after big play.After Calabasas (1-3) got on the scoreboard first with a 3-yard touchdown pass from Contreras to Adam Geukens, Agoura answered with a 24-yard touchdown pass from Novak to Brady Dieffenbach.On the next play from scrimmage, Contreras connected with Arion Lang for a 48-yard touchdown pass.Agoura responded with a 9-yard touchdown run by Michael Longo, which was followed by a kickoff return for a touchdown by Calabasas’ Caleb Yang.

On and on it went as each team countered one another.A missed PAT in overtime, Calabasas’ third failed PAT of the night, proved to be the difference.“The snap was off, so I knew it was not going to go in,” Dieffenbach said.“I was not watching, I was too scared to watch,” Agoura wideout Miles Hull said with a laugh.Agoura wide receivers Brady Dieffenbach, left, and Miles Hull combined for 20 catches for 339 yards and six touchdowns in a victory over Calabasas 54-53 in overtime Friday, Sept. 8.
