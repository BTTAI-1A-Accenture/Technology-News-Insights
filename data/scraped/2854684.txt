			TRENDING:		 A new art program at Amherst Exempted Village Schools has broadened the availability of classes in the district, especially at Marion L. Steele High School.Led by art teacher Chad DiFranco, the program includes two ceramics classes for students to take in addition to the four art levels offered by Steele High.Principal Joseph Tellier said the classes there have evolved since he took over his position.Tellier was named principal in 2019.DiFranco, a veteran teacher of 25 years, earned his bachelor’s degree in art education at Ashland University and his master’s degree in the same subject at Cleveland State University before joining the district.“Kids need to work with their hands,” he said. “While the art classes in the past have included some form of ceramics work, these new classes envision it in a completely new way.”Currently in its second semester, the ceramics classes focus on first getting students used to working with clay before delving into more complex structures, DiFranco said.The class has filled up quickly with nearly 20 students in Ceramics II during the second period. The program has introduced more than 100 students to the craft since its beginning in August 2022. (Lauren Hoffman — The Morning Journal)As part of a final project in Ceramics II, students are tasked to build their own large-scale sculpture ranging anywhere from one to three feet.

The classes have been extremely well received, according to DiFranco, with slots filling up quickly.Related Articles

While the program still is new, he said classes have gone smoothly.“Next year, I think we will make Art I a prerequisite for the class because we have some students that have never done art being thrown into ceramics,” DiFranco said. “But they are learning the ropes quickly.”Talks also are underway to offer an advanced placement ceramics class where students can earn college credit for their work, he said.Meanwhile, opportunities to earn recognition for their pieces already exist, DiFranco said.“One of the bigger parts of what we do in these classes is our participation in the Scholastic Art awards show,” he said. “I let my students choose up to five pieces they can submit for the show that then go on to be judged in our region.“If students earn gold key awards for their work, it then moves on to the national show in New York.”Art teacher Chad DiFranco said he is proud of his students as well as the positive reviews the class has received by both students and peers. (Lauren Hoffman — The Morning Journal)In the past, both DiFranco and art teacher Tony Trunzo have had multiple students’ works move to the national level.But for most students, the class isn’t about the competition, but rather the creativity.“This class has been very important to me because it gives me time to let ideas run, and I don’t have to worry about the stress of tests,” said Kaitlyn Myers, a senior taking the ceramics II class. “Plus, we have the freedom to design what we want which is really nice.” Led by art teacher Chad DiFranco, the program includes two ceramics classes for students to take in addition to the four art levels offered by Steele High.
