Hershey Pride, a grassroots Pride event in Central Pennsylvania, took place in Chocolatetown Park, Hershey with many individuals, couples and families attending despite some early drizzle. Building on the success of the last two years, HersheyPride celebrates an inclusive and vibrant LGBTQIA+ community in central Pennsylvania. The family event included vendors, activities like face-painting and games, drag performers and a free live concert by GLAAD Award nominee Trey Pearson. The 2021 Pride gatherings were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic so a local group of individuals came together to create a Hershey Pride in the Park festival at Chocolatetown Park in downtown Hershey. Last year’s Pride Festival saw remarkable growth in attendance and the 2023 festival saw more vendors, entertainment and attendees.
