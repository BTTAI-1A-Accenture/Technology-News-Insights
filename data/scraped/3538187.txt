Louise Thomas Editor The Budapest World Championships are closing in and after a thrilling British Championships, attention turns to the London Diamond League. Keely Hodgkinson will headline the London Stadium event in the women's 800m, while Dina Asher-Smith and Daryll Neita will be looking to make a statement in a stacked women's 100m, with Shericka Jackson and Sha'Carri Richardson offering formidable competition in a race that could resemble the world final in Budapest later this summer.  Zharnel Hughes is the newly-crowned double British champion over 100m, where he recently broke Linford Christie's 30-year British record by running 9.83 seconds, and the 200m. The Briton will face off against two-time world champion Noah Lyles, which should provide insight into Hughes’ potential for Budapest.
