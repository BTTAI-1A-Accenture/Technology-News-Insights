SUN Racing tackles Tuesday's racing confident of landing some winners. Read on for our tips and back a horse by clicking their odds. LONGSHOT ST ANDREW’S CASTLE (6.30 Ayr) He didn’t get the run of the race at Hamilton last time and can finish a lot closer under 5lb claimer Jonny Peate today. THIEF MR FAYEZ (2.23 Brighton) He was a close-up fourth on his turf comeback at Yarmouth last time and looks in the mix. WHITE MIST (2.53 Brighton) She was just pipped on the all-weather last time and looks on a fair weight switching to turf. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.
