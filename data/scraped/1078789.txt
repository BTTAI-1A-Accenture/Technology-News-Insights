While their lips nearly touch, they refrain from actually smooching.  Still, the video proceeds to get steamier as they get in the kitchen and feed each other strawberries, whipped cream and sliced watermelon.  At the end of the video, however, Wade wakes up, indicating it was all just a dream that never happened.  In the final seconds, Richards appears at her door and walks in. Before closing it, Wade winks at the camera.  Leaning into the rumors: While the duo have remained coy about the nature of their relationship, the 54-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star openly daydreamed about a life with the Virginia native, 28 All a fantasy: The video proceeds to get steamier as they get in the kitchen and feed each other strawberries, whipped cream and sliced watermelon Intimate: The woman stood just mere inches from each other On Thursday, Richards and Wade wrote a joint caption, which read: 'It's campy and fun — but also important and representative of all kinds of love, even in the country space, in any space.

The documentary she is producing about the singer will reportedly focus on her swift rise to fame and her struggles with addiction, as well as her plans to soon have a double mastectomy to decrease her chances of developing breast cancer after she tested positive for the BRCA gene, which significantly increases one's likelihood of developing the disease. Last month, Kyle announced that she and her husband Mauricio were separating after 27 years of marriage, though they insisted at the time that there had been no 'wrongdoing on anyone's part.'
