The company estimates the aggregate cost of an impairment will range between $2.0 million and $3.2 million.
		  In addition, BigCommerce is reiterating its financial guidance, as outlined in the its third quarter earnings release issued on November 3, 2022, for both the fourth quarter and the full year 2022.  Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks
