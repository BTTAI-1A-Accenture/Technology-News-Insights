INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers battled but couldn't get enough second-half stops against the Utah Jazz and lost 123-117 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on Monday night. The Pacers dropped their fifth straight game and their 16th in their last 18, falling to 25-34. The Jazz improved to 29-30. Here are four observations. The Pacers had a strong defensive performance in the first half, especially by their recently low standards, but they ultimately couldn't slow down Jazz All-Star Lauri Markkanen or sharpshooter Jordan Clarkson. Markkanen finished with 29 points on 10 of 20 shooting and the Pacers simply couldn't handle his size while they were also dealing with big man Walker Kessler and with Myles Turner out of commission. Meanwhile Clarkson scored 29 points on 9-of-17 shooting and hit 6-of-8 3-pointers including some daggers to help put the game away. In large part because they were cooking, the Jazz shot 56.8% in the second half and made 11 of their 18 3-pointers after the break. Clarkson was particularly deadly after halftime, scoring 22 points on 6 of 8 shooting including a perfect 5 of 5 from 3-point range. "There was high-level shot-making down the stretch," Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton said. "I thought Jordan made some tough shots down the end there. They got to the free throw line and the start of that fourth really hurt us. I think they attacked us in different ways. Obviously Lauri and Jordan both had good games. I don't know what they did specifically, I gotta watch film, but they did a good job of getting their guys going." Tyrese Haliburton has struggled to get all the way back to his old self since his return from a left elbow sprain earlier this month. From the night he came back he's made some dazzling plays but never seemed to put together a complete performance. On Monday night he was still shaky in the first half, but put together a phenomenal second half, scoring 25 of his 30 points after the break. He also finished with 12 assists, including six in the second half but it wasn't quite enough with the Jazz making just a few too many shots. Haliburton was just 2 of 9 from the field, 1 of 2 from 3-point range in the first half, but he scored 13 points in the third, shooting 5 of 6, then 12 more in the fourth shooting 5 of 9. He finished 12 of 24 from the floor for the game, including 3 of 8 from 3. He committed just one turnover in nearly 35 minutes of action. Haliburton's 24 field goal attempts were the most he's had in a game since he took 24 in his first game back against the Lakers. He had 26 points in that game and has been putting an emphasis on trying to look for his shot more. "We just keep talking about it," Haliburton said. "It's trying to find that balance between being aggressive, getting guys involved and what's best for the team at that point in time. ... When I have it going, I gotta find ways to get myself shots. Coach lets me dictate a lot of the sets that we run. So trying to think of it that way. Sometimes, different games since I've come back, I've shot seven, eight, nine shots, that's selfish by not shooting enough. We talked about trading that off. Whatever the teams need at the time. Today I thought there were some favorable matchups for me." Jordan Nwora didn't expect to get jumped after starter's introductions and end up in the center of the Pacers' mosh-pit like pre-game ritual, but that was one of the few times the forward looked out of sorts in his first outing with the Pacers after being acquired from the Bucks last week. Nwora scored seven points on 3-of-8 shooting, including a 3-pointer, playing both forward positions and also providing some rebounding and defense. He grabbed three boards and two steal to go with those points in 17 minutes, 24 seconds. "I felt like it was decent," Nwora said. "Obviously, first game out there, learning in terms of just being in positions and being in the right spot. I think overall it was good. Obviously you want to always come out with the win. It happens. ... I felt like I was trying to let it come to me more. I was trying to play hard on defense. I can score the ball, I just have to lock in on defense." The veteran George Hill played 9:35, but Pacers fans were clearly thrilled to see him back in Gainbridge Fieldhouse. Hill, of course, starred at Broad Ripple High School and IUPUI and helped the Pacers reach the Eastern Conference finals in 2013 and 2014. He drew a massive ovation when he was welcomed back to "The Circle City." "It's good to be back," Hill said. "Haven't played in a while. Good to get back on the court and get your feet back. Gotta continue to work on things and my conditioning and be better." Myles Turner sat out Monday's game with lower back soreness which at least for a day allowed the Pacers to find more minutes to his backups who have been stuck in a log jam for minutes. Veteran Daniel Theis started the game and played 22 minutes, scoring 11 points on 5-of-13 shooting and grabbing five rebounds. Isaiah Jackson came off the bench and was arguably more impressive, finishing with 11 points, five rebounds and an impressive four blocks. "Daniel's got more experience," Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. "I knew Isaiah was going to get plenty of minutes. A veteran player in this situation has a better chance coming out of warm-ups to play his best. And Isaiah, he's like a Ferrari. You just turn a key and he's going. I thought both of those guys did some great things."
