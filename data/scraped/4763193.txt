Shahjalal University of Science and Technology on Monday celebrated its 32nd founding anniversary with different colourful programmes. The university vice-chancellor professor Farid Uddin Ahmed inaugurated the anniversary programmes at about 10:00am by hoisting the national flag and the university flag in front of Administrative Building-2 on the campus. SUST teachers and officials led by the vice-chancellor paid tribute to Bangladesh’s founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through placing a wreath in front of his mural at Bangabandhu Chattar on the campus. Later, a colourful procession was also brought out from the Bangabandhu Chattar after releasing balloons in the sky to mark the founding anniversary of the university. Parading main streets on the campus, the procession ended at the Muktamancha. A brief rally was held at the Muktamancha. At the rally, vice-chancellor Farid Uddin said that the SUST succeeded in playing a positive role at the national level. ‘We want to perform the best at the international level. We want cooperation from all quarters, including the SUST family members, to achieve our goal,’ he said. The university treasurer Md Anwarul Islam, Teachers Association president Md Kabir Hossain and business administration faculty dean Md Khayrul Islam also addressed the programme that was attended by huge numbers of teachers, officials and employees. At the end of the procession, the university administration also cut a cake marking its 32nd Birthday.  SUST started its journey in 1991 with three departments and 120 students. At present, about 11,000 students are studying at 28 departments under six faculties of the university.
