 [UPBEAT MUSIC] BILL WESTRATE, CEO, American Family Insurance: The American Family Insurance Championship champion
for 2023, Steve Stricker. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] STEVE STRICKER: Today was a difficult day,
fighting my nerves and the emotions
of trying to win a golf tournament,
especially here in Madison. BILL WESTRATE, CEO, American Family Insurance: You'll notice our trophy says,
right on it, Dream Achieved. STEVE STRICKER: 15 years ago, we had this dream together,
and look where we are today.
You know, I think where it really hits home to me
is just the impact that we're having here
in the community and the monies that we're raising
for the hospital and the charities.
And, you know, Nicki, love you.
 [AUDIENCE CHEERING] STEVE STRICKER: This one definitely means more than any tournament
throughout my whole career, really. JIM BUCHHEIM, Community & Social Impact Officer, American Family Insurance: How about one more round of applause
for our champion, Steve Stricker. [UPBEAT MUSIC]
