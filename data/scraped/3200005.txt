Grandpap was a world-champion steer roper," McEntire told CMT in 2011. "So we had champions in our family, and I consider my mama a champion for just putting up with all four of us kids." According to E! News, a young McEntire was taking driving lessons on her family's ranch at just 5 years old. She helped her dad drive their truck while he pushed hay off the back to feed the cattle on the ranch. McEntire has also been performing since she was a child, and always with the support of her beloved "mama."  "It was mama who encouraged us kids to sing, taught us how to sing, took us to our singing jobs," she told fellow country superstar Garth Brooks on TalkShopLive. "Thirteen years old playing beer joints and honky-tonks, Peg, Susie and I, getting up there and singing."  McEntire followed her father's rodeo footsteps and fell in love with barrel racing. Participants use their horses to attempt to complete a clover-leaf pattern around barrels as fast as possible. In 2011, McEntire revealed that her father was not sold on her future as a barrel racer and encouraged her to quit. Reba McEntire in 1985.

However, she later realized that she had a talent that was going to open new doors for her. "When I got good attention from the singing," McEntire told CMT in 2011. "I knew that was probably where I needed to land." It was not until 1974 that McEntire got her big break. She was hired to sing the national anthem at the National Rodeo in Oklahoma City. The performer caught Red Steagall's attention, which led to her being signed to Mercury Records. Reba McEntire got her big break in 1974.

Reba McEntire, who lost most of her band in a tragic plane accident in 1991, sang "I'm Checkin' Out" at the 63rd Academy Awards.

It's like losing part of your family." Days after the crash, McEntire put on a brave face and took the stage at the 63rd Academy Awards.

(Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images) "When we would play games or cards, I'd never let Shelby win," Reba told the outlet at the time. "He wouldn't have learned anything that way. I always told Shelby, 'I'll always love you, but I want other people to like you. So don't be a little jerk. Don't be a spoiled brat.'" It seems McEntire’s hard work has paid off. She notes people have told her they "would never know (he) had been blessed with the life he was given" had they not already known he was the country legend’s son. "I'm very proud of him," McEntire said. "He was a kid who had ADHD and could barely read in school, and now he's read 10 books this year. He's always trying to improve and do better. His daddy did a great job too." Reba McEntire is "proud" of the man Shelby grew up to be. (Lynn Goldsmith/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images) Despite all of her success, McEntire says welcoming Shelby changed her life for the better, opening her eyes to what is important in life and giving her a deeper purpose. "Shelby is a gift from God to me," she said. "We're very close. I was a very self-centered person to a degree before Shelby. But then there's a little character who you are given the job to protect and nurture and love and teach, so all the attention's not on you anymore."

"It was a very popular show in Holland, I'm pretty sure, and I watched the tape, and I said, 'No, I'm going to pass on that,' because I don't think I could ever be able to tell somebody that they're terrible or ‘Go find another job’ or ‘Hope you like your nighttime job.’ I couldn't do that day in and day out. I just couldn't do it. So I did pass on it."  Even though she originally passed on the coach role, McEntire still appeared in the first season of "The Voice" as a mentor to Team Blake and has subsequently appeared as a celebrity mentor over the years. At the time, the star noted that after seeing the show, she may have overestimated how much negativity she would have had to dish out.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "Oh sure!
