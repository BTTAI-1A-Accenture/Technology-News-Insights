 Popular online payment platform Stripe has recently acquired Okay, a San Francisco-based analytics platform that helps engineering teams monitor members’ productivity. Okay was founded 3 years ago in 2019 by CEO Antoine Boulanger and CTO Tomas Barreto. The two met at a tech firm called Box in San Francisco, where they were a senior director of engineering and VP of engineering, respectively. The two founders have an extensive understanding of the industry, especially engineers and how they work. Before their job at Box, Boulanger worked at Google as the senior engineer manager, and Barreto worked at Checkr as the vice president of product and engineering. Soon after they met, the idea of a coding-based performance monitoring tool blossomed. Talking further about their journey with Okay, they revealed that their work at Box played a crucial role in creating Okay. After all, they were working on building in-house tools that’ll help managers at their company manage the teams better. That’s when the idea struck— what if there was a subscription-based tool for all managers that could help them with team management? The company was doing fairly well in the initial years. In fact, in 2020, it participated in Y Combinator’s Winter cohort and, soon after, managed to raise a massive sum of $6.6 million in capital from renowned investors like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. Although we don’t have any official numbers about their revenue or growth, in February 2022, the co-founders commented that the company has grown over 10x in the last few years. Although the company will now be under Stripe, both founders will continue to be a crucial part of the team. It’s more like joining forces; the two companies with similar values with regard to engineering and engineer productivity are simply coming together to create something even better. The business will go on as usual with the only difference that instead of its other clients like Intercom and Brex, Okay will now be exclusively serving Stripe. Stripe remained unavailable for a comment on their new acquisition. However, CTO David Singleton tweeted to confirm the news and to welcome team Okay aboard. Prior to the acquisition, Okay had 7 employees. However, it is yet to be confirmed if those 7 employees will join Stripe as well. Many details about the acquisition, including the cost, have been kept under wraps. Reports suggest that this acquisition wasn’t all too sudden. In fact, Okay had been evaluating acquirers for quite some time now. However, it was Stripe that managed to stand out. In Boulanger’s words, “Stripe was really special” Krishi is an eager Tech Journalist and content writer for both B2B and B2C, with a focus on making the process of purchasing software easier for businesses and enhancing their online presence and SEO.
