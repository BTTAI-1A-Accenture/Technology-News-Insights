The first event of the PGA Tour’s new FedExCup fall is in the books. Sahith Theegala, No. 31 in points and already safely into every signature tournament in 2024, took home the Fortinet Championship trophy, his first career Tour title. But that wasn’t the only significant result from Sunday in Napa.  Nos. 51 and beyond in points – all but five players in the Fortinet field – are still playing for improved status next season. Nos. 51-60 after the fall will get into the first two signature events following The Sentry, the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am (Feb. 1-4) and Genesis Invitational (Feb. 15-18). Perhaps more importantly, players inside the top 125 will retain their full cards while Nos. 126-150 will get conditional status for 2024. The remaining fall slate: Here is a snapshot of the FedExCup picture with six fall tournaments remaining: 51. Mac Hughes52. Nick Hardy53. Taylor Montgomery54. Alex Smalley55. Thomas Detry56.

KimMovement: +26 (No. 83 to No. 57)What it means: He couldn’t catch Theegala, settling for a runner-up finish by two shots, but he did leap into the Next 10 picture. The second-place showing was the rookie’s first top-10 since the Shriners last fall. Troy MerrittMovement: +15 (No. 133 to No. 118)What it means: Veteran closed in 65 at Fortinet to tie for seventh and shoot up the points standings, inside the top 125 number. J.J. SpaunMovement: +2 (No. 62 to No. 60)What it means: Now in position for that Next 10 thanks to T-11 finish at Sliverado. Austin SmothermanMovement: -2 (No. 125 to No. 127)What it means: Missed cut in Napa – his sixth MC in his last eight starts – to get knocked from top 125 bubble. Davis RileyMovement: -3 (No. 59 to No. 62)What it means: Falls out of Next 10 for now. Missed 6 of 11 cuts after winning Zurich alongside Nick Hardy. Wasn’t in Fortinet field and hasn’t played since a T-43 in Memphis. Hayden BuckleyMovement: -4 (No. 60 to No. 64)What it means: No longer the last man into the Next 10.
