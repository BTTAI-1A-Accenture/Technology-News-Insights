DuckDuckGo, the privacy-focused search engine, has launched the first open beta version of its browser on Windows. Similar to the Android, iOS and Mac versions, DuckDuckGo for Windows brings several privacy-focused features like link tracking protection, Google AMP protection and 3rd party tracker loading protection. In a blog post, the developers said that the ‘DuckDuckGo for Windows’ comes with its own password manager, with users able to import their saved passwords and bookmarks from other browsers. The company also added that the functionality will be useful when it rolls out private syncing across devices. The Windows version is also getting the company’s alternative to ad-blockers, which works by blocking trackers before they load and removing whitespace left by ads for a clean look. For users who binge-watch on YouTube, the browser features a built-in video player called ‘Duck Player’ which prevents websites from tracking cookies and serving personalised ads. Videos you watch in Duck Player won’t be visible in your personalized recommendations or advertising profile. On the left side of the address bar, users can toggle different types of protection for individual pages in case the parts of the website they are visiting are being blocked by DuckDuckGo. Moreover, the browser also prevents the majority of ‘I accept’ pop-ups from loading in the first place. The company says DuckDuckGo for Windows is not a fork of any other browser and uses ‘Windows WebView2’ powered by the Blink engine to render web pages.
