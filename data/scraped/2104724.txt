NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Fred admits he is unsure over his future at Manchester United following interest from Fulham. The Brazil international has just one year left on his deal with United, who could sell this summer in order to avoid seeing the midfielder leave on a free transfer next year. Erik ten Hag is also looking to bolster his midfield options with at least one new signing and talks with Chelsea have begun over a £50 million deal for Mason Mount. Fred, meanwhile, has been linked with a move to Fulham and was pulled aside for a chat with manager Marco Silva outside Old Trafford on the final day of the Premier League season. When asked about his future after United’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday, Fred replied: ‘I still don’t know, I have to talk with my family, I still have one year left in my contract here. ‘Now it’s holidays’ time and a good opportunity to rest. ‘I’ll talk to my staff, to the club and see what is everyone’s decision. I do have to talk with Ten Hag as well, he’s the manager and the conversation has to involve everyone.
