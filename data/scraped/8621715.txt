1. Murder Mystery 2


Undoubtedly, Among Us is one of the most creative multiplayer games out there. Unfortunately, your entire friend group has to purchase the game to take part in its action. But, if you want the same thrilling experience without paying a buck then Roblox’s Murder Mystery 2 is made for you. Though, instead of creating a clone of the original, this game puts a new spin on it.



You spawn in a group of strangers, one of them is the murderer who is supposed to kill everyone and another person is the sheriff who is responsible for taking down the murderer. If you spawn as an innocent stranger, you not only have to survive the murderer but also help the sheriff find them. Meanwhile, as the murderer, much like an imposter, you have to kill everyone before the sheriff suspects you cunningly. Lastly, as the sheriff, you ultimately have to kill the imposter before everyone else dies.

3. BedWars


If you spend time on the best Minecraft servers, you are bound to come across a variety of Bedwars minigames. This free Roblox game uses its main concept and pushes it to another level. You spawn in a team of 5 inside a world that doesn’t look too different from Minecraft, thanks to its blocky and simple terrain. Then, much like the original Bedwars, you have to protect your bed (aka your spawn point) from the enemy team.



Once a team loses all of its beds, its members can’t respawn. The team with the last member standing wins the round. But it isn’t as simple as fighting and killing your opponents. Thanks to the diverse set of items in Roblox, you have to find a way to deal with a bunch of creative weapons too. From jetpacks to flame arrows, nothing option is out of reach. You just have to survive long enough to outlive your opponents.
