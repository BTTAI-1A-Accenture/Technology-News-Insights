Banijay Americas has purchased a majority stake in the Brazilian studio A Fábrica. Based in Rio de Janeiro, A Fábrica is behind Vai Que Cola, Brazil’s highest-rated pay-TV sitcom. In addition to the upcoming Netflix comedy series Sem Filtro, the studio is preparing to launch A Divisão, a co-production with Afroreggae Audiovisual that is set to debut on Globoplay in 2023. On the film side, A Fábrica has produced original titles for theatrical release, as well as for streaming platforms. It recently delivered Modo Avião, which charted the highest audience for a non-English-language film in Netflix’s history. A Fábrica was initially launched in January 2016 by partners Luiz Noronha (CEO), Renato Fagundes (chief content officer), Cecilia Grosso and Samanta Moraes (producers) and Alberto Elias (CFO). A Fábrica’s management team will remain in place, reporting to Laurens Drillich, president of Endemol Shine Latino. “When we look at potential new partnerships and or acquisitions, we always start with a search for talented storytellers and strong leadership and the team at A Fábrica was clearly at the top of that list,” said Ben Samek, president and COO of Banijay Americas. “They have quickly established A Fábrica as Brazil’s go-to studio for the best in film and scripted content, and we are thrilled to have their team join our roster of world-class production studios in the Americas.” Estrella Media and TV Azteca have struck up a content and programming partnership for the U.S. and Mexico.
