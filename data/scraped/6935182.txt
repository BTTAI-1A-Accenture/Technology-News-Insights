Knix just opened the doors to their warehouse sale, happening this weekend from February 24 to 26 at the Vancouver Convention Centre. The sale is on from 10 am to 8 pm and is truly massive. You’ve probably never seen so much underwear in one place. But it’s more than just bras and panties; you can shop for activewear, loungewear, swimwear, and layering pieces, too.

Some items for sale aren’t available on their website anymore, so it’s truly a treasure hunt when you find a style in your size in the perfect colour. They have an excellent range of sizes available as well, from XS to XXXL+. Here’s a look at what you’ll find with prices: There are no fitting rooms at the sale, so it’s a good idea to know your size in advance by checking out their size chart, or you can drop by the fitting station before you start shopping. For payment, the sale is debit and credit only, and all items are final sale.  When: February 24 to 26 from 10 am to 8 pm
