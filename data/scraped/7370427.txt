     Are you wanting to sell items you no longer need or use? Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson explains the pros and cons of selling your items on Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp. People love collecting stuff. Although you might call it junk, they'd like to refer to it as their treasures. There's a whole community of people who love going to garage or tag sales and searching to buy things on popular resale websites. Many Americans are looking for ways to spring clean and unload unwanted belongings to make some extra cash in this economy.  Online secondhand sales have grown in popularity, especially since the emergence of Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp, so let's discuss which app is the better platform to sell your things.

A con is that there is no buyer protection. (Meta) MORE: IS FACEBOOK LISTENING TO YOU?   iPhone: 4.8 stars (at the time of publishing)   Android: 4.4 stars (at the time of publishing)   A pro of listing on OfferUp is that it is free, while many sites and apps will charge you when you list a product. A con is that you cannot ship to some states. ( CyberGuy.com) So with all the pros and cons listed for each app, which one is better for selling your unwanted items? My opinion is if you’re selling something online, try both apps. Each one offers great benefits and has its challenges, so you can try both out and see which one better suits your needs. And if you're mostly concerned with the amount of money you'll get, you can even list on additional sites like Craigslist or Mercari and see where you’re going to get the most cash.  Try using both Facebook Marketplace and OfferUp to see which gives you the best-selling experience or try another site. (CyberGuy.com)  MORE: HOW TO CHANGE YOUR FACEBOOK PASSWORD  CHECK WASHING FRAUD IS THE LATEST SCAM AIMED AT YOU Beware of overly enthusiastic buyers showing interest in your listing, as they may be scammers trying to rush the transaction and move communication to a different messaging service. This can be risky as OfferUp won't be able to assist if any issues arise. Always stay within OfferUp's platform for buying or selling and avoid switching to other messaging services like Facebook Messenger.  Scammers frequently attempt to deceive you with counterfeit websites that are designed to mimic legitimate ones, such as OfferUp. However, by paying careful attention to the URL and visual cues on the webpage, you can spot the fraud. It's important to be vigilant and avoid making purchases on spoofed websites, as doing so may result in losing your money without receiving the item. To safeguard against spoofing scams, always conduct business exclusively on the official OfferUp website.  HOW SCAMMERS ARE SELLING COUNTERFEIT STAMPS ON FACEBOOK ADS This scam is highly sophisticated and can easily deceive anyone. The modus operandi involves a potential buyer expressing interest in your item for sale and requesting verification of your identity as a genuine seller. This may seem legitimate on the surface, prompting them to ask for your phone number to send a verification code. However, in reality, the code is not for verification purposes at all. Clicking on the link could result in your credentials and banking information being stolen, or your device being infected with malware. It's crucial to never click on links sent by individuals through OfferUp, as the platform has its own verification process that does not involve verification codes. If anyone demands this type of information, it's best to walk away to protect yourself from falling victim to this scam.  The empty box scam is as straightforward as it sounds - you make a purchase on OfferUp, but the seller deceives you by sending an empty box instead. To protect yourself from falling victim to such scams, it's best to conduct all your transactions through the OfferUp app. In case the seller fails to deliver the purchased item, you can file a complaint with OfferUp to seek a refund.  Additionally, it's crucial to check the seller's reviews before making a purchase. If they have a history of scamming others, their reviews are likely to reflect it. It's advisable to steer clear of sellers with negative reviews, and exercise caution when dealing with those who have no reviews at all.  This type of scam is pervasive across most online marketplaces. Here's how it typically unfolds: a buyer purchases an item from you, but instead of paying the agreed-upon price, they send an excess amount, claiming it was an innocent error. They then request that you return the overpaid amount to rectify the situation.  However, this is where the scam comes into play. In reality, the check they sent will eventually bounce, or if the payment was made electronically, they will falsely claim to their bank that the transaction was fraudulent and retract the payment from you. If you comply and return the overpaid amount, you'll end up losing not only the extra money they sent but also the original payment and the item you sold.  To protect yourself from falling victim to these scams, always ensure that the buyer's payment has cleared and is securely in your bank account before refunding any overpayment. Additionally, stick to using the original marketplace, such as OfferUp, to complete the transaction. Scammers may attempt to steer you toward a different payment platform that lacks proper protections for your money.  TIPS TO HELP YOU TELL IF AN ONLINE STORE IS REAL OR A SCAM While it may feel embarrassing if you are targeted and fall victim to a scam, know you are not alone. Don't be afraid to speak up and report any scam. There's a chance you can stop someone from scamming others, and you want to take these steps, so your personal information isn't compromised.  Identity theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. The great part of an identity theft company like my #1 pick is that you’re provided with your own personal case manager that will help you recover any losses.  See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft by visiting CyberGuy.com/IdentityTheft.

While Facebook Marketplace offers great exposure and is free to use, it does require a personal account attachment and lacks buyer protection. On the other hand, OfferUp has a verification system and pre-approved community meet-up stops, however, may have limitations on shipping and charges shipping fees. Ultimately, trying out both apps and even considering additional sites like Craigslist or Mercari can help you determine which platform better suits your needs when selling your items.  Have you tried selling on Facebook Marketplace or OfferUp?
