MSNBC is adding another notable news anchor to its dayside lineup. 
	Ana Cabrera, who left CNN at the end of last year, will anchor MSNBC’s 10 a.m. hour in a program called Ana Cabrera Reports.

 
	Jose Diaz-Balart most recently anchored the hour for MSNBC, but shifted to 11 a.m. as part of a larger shake-up earlier this year. 
	MSNBC has reworked its daytime lineup over the last few years under the “Reports” brand name, with news anchors like Diaz-Balart, Katy Tur, Chris Jansing, Andrea Mitchell and others hosting their own versions of the news-driven format. As with the other Reports shows, Cabrera’s program will include in-the-field reporting, interviews with newsmakers and discussions around current events.
