Sign In Register Netflix reality-dating show fans are familiar with Vancouver's Francesca Farago.  The local influencer and Netflix reality personality got her start on the first season of Too Hot To Handle, and recently reappeared on Perfect Match where the Vancouverite stirred up some drama.  Now, Farago is set to join a wild new dating show with language-learning app Duolingo called Love Language where 10 "confident and flirty singles" who don't speak the same language will attempt to find true love. The contestants must take daily language lessons and find a match or "face the consequences" from the show's host and TikTok personality Duo the Owl. In the end, only one couple will win a grand prize. However, it's all fake.  While the dating show, announced by NBCUniversal's Peacock, is an early April Fool's Day stunt, it's also a real deal, reports Variety. The "Love Language" promotion, which runs until April 19, includes a 50 per cent discount on three months of Peacock Premium (Peacock, alas, is not available in Canada). Duolingo is also offering one month of free access to Super Duolingo.    © 2024 Vancouver Is Awesome
