The paint job you see on this Audi isn’t something you will be able to get from you local dealer when this car goes on sale at the end of 2023. The reason for the gaudy Audi wrapping is to indicate that this is a prototype. And while we are used to getting early drives of new cars, this Q6 is especially interesting. It is the first car to use a collection of parts which will underpin a lot of posh new electric models from Audi and Porsche. Maybe even a Bentley.The Q6 is the same underneath as the new Porsche Macan and the all-electric A6. This is the first chance we’ve had to try this slice of the future. Audi says the bits underneath the Q6 will "redefine the industry’s benchmarks in terms of performance, range, and charging.The Q6 name probably gives away where this car fits in the Audi line up – it’s smaller than a Q8 e-tron but bigger than the Q4. It is due to go on sale at the end of 2023 with a price I’ve been promised will start with a five. That’s going to be decent value, since a BMW iX3 starts at £64,000.The figures we’ve seen for the Q6 make that 'redefining' claim look like a bit of an exaggeration, but the figures are certainly impressive. Join Tom as he takes a first drive of the new Q6 e-tron in prototype form. Is the future bright for Audi's next-generation electric cars?
