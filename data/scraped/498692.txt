A Nashville florist is refusing to serve a Republican National Committee fundraiser featuring Trump in protest lack of action on gun control laws. Via The Hill: In a statement posted on Instagram this week, FLWR Shop said it declined an inquiry from the RNC to provide floral design services for a fundraising event in Nashville this weekend. The florist also shared a letter it sent to the RNC declining the potential order. The shop said that it immediately declined the offer and hopes to encourage other Nashville businesses to refuse money from the RNC “until they begin to make the changes to gun laws that most Americans are calling for.” In the letter, the shop owners specifically call attention to the recent shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, which killed three students and three adult staff members. “Our community has just lost seven people, including three young children, to yet another school shooting. At this moment I cannot ignore the work that the RNC has done to create this tragedy and so many others like it,” the letter said. “The Republican Party has wasted taxpayer money and precious legislative will on banning drag shows, rather than assault rifles that are being used to murder children in their classrooms,” the letter added.
