We haven’t touched the taste, only the packaging, promises owner Coca-Cola The soft drink Lilt has vanished from the UK after 48 years and has been rebranded as a new type of Fanta. The tangy drink was launched in 1975 with the strapline “the totally tropical taste” and was sold only in the UK, Ireland, Gibraltar and Seychelles. The drink’s packaging and logo are being changed and it will now be known as Fanta Pineapple and Grapefruit, said the brand’s owner, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola said: “Keen Lilt fans may have spotted a gradual transition as the drink has made its way into the Fanta family over the past few months, with changes to its packaging and logo. “Some have even hypothesised on social media that Lilt may be becoming part of the Fanta brand, and one even went as far as producing their own news broadcast-style video.” The company’s GB vice-president of commercial development said that the drink itself was unchanged. Martin Attock said: “Our main priority with this announcement is to reassure Lilt’s loyal fanbase that absolutely nothing has changed when it comes to the iconic taste of the drink they know and love. It’s still bursting with tangy tropical flavours, it’s just got itself a new name.” Lilt became a feature of popular culture with its Lilt Man parody adverts in the late 1980s, and a decade later it was promoted by two Jamaican women known as the Lilt Ladies. Coca-Cola reduced the number of calories, sugar and artificial sweeteners in the drink between 2008 and 2014 as part of efforts to make healthier products in response to the government’s public health responsibility deal. The rebranded drink will be available from 14 February.
