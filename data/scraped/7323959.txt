 Happy World Creativity and Innovation Day! For today, I would like to highlight my pivot to innovation and how it has literally changed my life. For those who I have not talked to for a long time, yes, I recently finished my Master of Science in Innovation and Business (MSIB) at the Asian Institute of Management (AIM). What you see in the photo is my medal from AIM and my law school UP sablay. By the grace of God, I was able to finish as valedictorian and with High Distinction.  So what now? Well, things have been the same for some and completely different for other parts of my life.  When people ask me what I am doing now, I often use this branding: In law school, this was the dream. And now that I am living it, I feel immensely happy and privileged to have achieved this feat in such a short period of time. Friends are genuinely happy for me and are telling me to develop my skills further to become one of the best practitioners in the field. However, life has taken (or more accurately, I steered my own course to) a direction different from my original trajectory. I guess this is a result of me suppressing my tech and innovation desires that I have been putting in the back burner so that I can focus on my tax lawyering. Then add the fact that my human rights lawyering has opened my eyes to the cruel reality majority of Filipinos face on a daily basis, especially MSMEs. After some soul searching, networking, and a bit of meditation, I have come to realize that my true passion and calling is not in taxation but rather in this unconventional field of legal innovation and the creative industry. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy (and practice) tax lawyering and believe that I will be in this field in the years to come. It just so happened that this pandemic made me realize that my innovation mindset and craving for continuous improvement have always been the driving force behind all the successes and failures I have experienced. Special mention to Maki Mitsuhashi for being an enabler in the innovation field and to Carla Mae Leonor for dragging me into the creative industry. What makes me really excited about the future is how I have seen my multidisciplinary self make real and lasting impact on the lives of MSMEs, especially in the creative field. I never, ever thought that someone like me who does not have a very creative mind (in my traditional understanding of the term) would ever find myself enjoying what I am now doing. With Bughaw Creative Collective, I am able to fulfil my need to work on my passions and advocacy while maximizing my special skillset and knowledge of the law and innovation in a sustainable way. I have so many things that I want to share but let's end here for today. More posts to come about law, innovation, and the creative industry!  #TheFutureIsCreative #CreatePhilippines #FilipinoCreativesCAN #BughawCreativeCollective #LegalInnovation Director @ PINVEST | Coaching, New Business Development WTG!
