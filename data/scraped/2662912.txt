Home > Game Guides If you’re playing Anime Champions Simulator on Roblox and you’re on the hunt for the elusive Secret Scroll for Ninten, you’ve come to the right place. This guide will walk you through the steps to locate and claim this item so that you can complete the quest for Ninten in ACS. While you’re here, why not check out our Anime Champions Simulator Codes to get some free goodies? Learn more about the game via the Trello page. If you’re after the best Quirks, have a look at our Anime Champions Simulator Quirks Tier List & Guide. After you get the quest from Ninten to find the Secret Scroll, make your way to the Ninja Village; this is the fourth world in Anime Champions Simulator that you can head to. Once there, locate the green burning house near the Forsaken One enemy. From this point, take the path to the left of the burning house. Continue past a campfire until you spot a waterfall. Now, you must go through the waterfall to discover a hidden cave.  Inside the cave, walk, keep walking straight ahead, and you’ll eventually find the Secret Scroll, which will be hanging on a wall and glowing. Approach it, and the game will prompt you to hold the E button to acquire it. Once you do, the quest will mark itself as complete, and all you need to do is press Complete Quest to get your rewards. If you want, head back to Ninten to see if she has anything else to say about the Secret Scroll. If you are having trouble, I recommend you watch this YouTube video by NoobBlox to help you! The Secret Scroll in ACS is nothing more than a quest item for Ninten. It does not grant you incredible powers that boost your stats or anything of the sort. It’s purely a quest item located behind a hidden waterfall, and in my opinion, anything hidden in a cave behind a waterfall is awesome!
