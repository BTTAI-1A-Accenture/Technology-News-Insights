The average cost of renters insurance in Arizona is $156 annually (around $13 per month), based on data from Quadrant Information Services. However, the actual cost will depend on your location, the value of your items, your claims history, property details and other personal information.  Because every city faces a different level of risk, insurance providers significantly consider your location when determining your renters insurance premium. For instance, Phoenix residents pay a higher-than-average cost, which might be because it faces a higher crime rate and risks of severe weather events.  You can look for the cheapest renters insurance companies if you want to save on your policy. Keep in mind, though, that it’s more important that your chosen policy offers sufficient coverage against damages and caters to your unique situation. The cheapest renters insurance provider in Arizona is State Farm with an average monthly cost of around $9. You can save on renters insurance in Arizona by shopping around for a policy, improving your property’s security to prevent theft and vandalism, and taking steps to protect it against natural disasters such as wildfires.  Using data from Quadrant Information Services, we obtained multiple quotes for each provider in this article and compared them to the average annual premium in the United States. According to this data, the average cost of renters insurance is $179.19 annually. Read our full cost methodology below. For providers unavailable in Quadrantâs database, we calculated the average annual premiums using quotes we manually pulled from the providerâs website or representatives. Quotes include comparable policy details in ZIP codes across the U.S. Your cost may vary depending on your location, coverage and personal property needs. Arizona isn’t at risk for common natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes or tropical storms. However, Arizona has its own set of natural threats, including wildfires, extreme heat, earthquakes, monsoon storms and excessive flooding. As you search for renters insurance, make sure your policy covers these areas. In many cases, renters insurance policies won’t cover flooding. If you live in an area where flooding is a threat, consider adding a separate flood insurance policy. It’s usually available as an add-on, although some companies include it in their standard policies. If you have questions about your insurance company, you can always discuss the issue with the provider’s representatives. However, if you think your insurance company violated Arizona law, file a complaint with the Arizona Department of Insurance and Financial Institutions (DIFI). DIFI regulates insurance and financial providers within Arizona, so if you have concerns or complaints, bring them to their attention. Alternatively, you can contact the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which helps state insurance regulators. It’s worth purchasing renters insurance in Arizona because it protects your personal property against natural disasters and other damages, which can be costly to repair without coverage. Renters insurance is not required by law, but you might have to buy it to satisfy terms of your lease.  Regardless of whether it’s required, a renters insurance policy can help you save significantly in the long run when it comes to dealing with damage due to severe weather events or theft. To help you understand how much you can save, we’ve listed the repair cost with insurance for a policy with $30,000 in personal property coverage and a $500 deductible both with and without filing a renters insurance claim. *These figures reflect average costs. The actual amount you pay will differ based on the extent of the damage.  The average cost of renters insurance in Arizona is $156 per year — about $13 a month. However, because policy costs depend on personal and property details, you will likely pay different rates. Arizona does not require that renters buy renters insurance, but some landlords can make it mandatory through a lease agreement. Regardless of the requirement, getting coverage can be worth it because of its protection. Renters insurance covers your personal property, liability and additional living expenses in case your property becomes uninhabitable. However, the coverage depends on your policy.
