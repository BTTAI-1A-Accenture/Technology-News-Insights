On Sunday, Aug. 20, the 27-year-old reality TV star posted a series of intimate new selfies to her Instagram grid, and they instantly became a favorite with fans. Using the mirror in a dimly lit room, Jenner posed for her iPhone camera in four of the new photos wearing a black bodycon gown cut with a high neckline, ruffled sleeves and a square back. Styling her hair in a chic updo, she completed the look with a pair of small silver earrings, a mauve lip, and a Dior black canvas mini saddle bag featuring floral embroidery.

While her latest look has clearly been a huge hit with fans, it may also be one of the safest she's worn all summer. Just a few days ago, she posed for a magazine cover wearing an ornate pair of gold underwear. Weeks prior, she flaunted her long legs in a micro-romper.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others.
