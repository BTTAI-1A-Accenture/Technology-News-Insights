Amanda Rose lost 150+lbs and inspires a nation on TikTok to do the same. LOS ANGELES (PRWEB) December 16, 2022   The creator economy is the future economy, according to a recent article by Fast Company. As GenZ and Millenials ingest their information more and more in the form of video content on platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, the 55+ crowd is an often overlooked demographic. As this crowd defies ageist stereotypes, more and more of this population are turning to TikTok for information and inspiration from others who are in their same age group. In a paper written by Dr. Reuben Ng, Not Too Old for TikTok: How Older Adults are Reframing Ageing, the paper looked at 1,382 videos posted by TikTok users who were aged 60 or older and had between 100,000 and 5.3 million followers. In total, the videos had been viewed more than 3.5 billion times. Showing there is a growing need for content creators to serve this demographic.
