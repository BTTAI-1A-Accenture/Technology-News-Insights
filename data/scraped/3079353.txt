The owners warned that the incident could have caused "serious damage" The Volk's Electric Railway in Brighton has been forced to urge a warning to anyone who may consider trespassing on its tracks. The warning comes after an image was shared online of a woman posing on the tracks for her Tinder profile. Though the railway is closed over the winter months, some replies noted that the photo looked "summery", suggesting the railway may have been operational around that time. This could pose extreme danger to anyone who may enter the line, which runs using an electric-conductor rail to power the train. The image appeared in response to another Twitter picture which showed one man standing on a railway line. Yesterday (January 16), Volk's Electric Railway issued words of warning to prevent anyone from making the same mistake.

This very silly person is lucky we were closed, otherwise that electric conductor rail she's leaning on would have done her some serious damage." In response, several other users suggested the individual should be "punished" for her "absurd" decision. One suggested a Â£1,000 fine for "trespassing on a railway line" whilst others simply noted the stupidity. Volk's Electric Railway is the "oldest electric railway in the world" that is still in operation. First opened 135-years-ago, the line, which was built by Magnus Volk, runs along the Brighton seafront and offers incredible views over the coast. Whilst it is not a train in the usual sense, it does still possess many of the dangers of an active railway line. The line is closed over the winter months but will reopen in time for Easter.
