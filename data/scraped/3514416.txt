Lost Liverpool nightclubs, from Cream to Paradox can be seen in these old photos The 1990s were 30 years ago, but for many of us it feels like it was only yesterday.  These photos from our archives show some of the music and fashion trends from that decade as well how much parts of the city have changed. In one photo, Michael Starke, who played Sinbad in Brookside, can be seen turning on the Christmas lights in the city centre in November 1996. Meanwhile, on Christmas Eve that year hundreds of shoppers can be seen queuing around the corner at the Disney Store to try and get their hands on a Buzz Lightyear toy. READ MORE: Man played iconic Brookside character and nobody even knows it Cream, O51, Garlands and Paradox are just some of the lost Liverpool nightclubs that show what the city's nightlife was like during the 90s. Lost shops from HMV to the Rapid Hardware Store on Renshaw Street can also be seen in these old photos. If you recognise anyone pictured be sure to let us know in the comments below.
