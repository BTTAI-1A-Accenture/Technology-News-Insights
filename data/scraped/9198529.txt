Credit: DIGITIMES STMicroelectronocs (ST) and Airbus have signed an agreement on June 20 to cooperate on power electronics R&D to support more efficient and lighter power electronics, essential for future hybrid-powered aircraft and full-electric urban air vehicles. It will be a key enabler of the aerospace industry's transition to hybrid and full-electric system According to a jointly published press release, both ST and Airbus have already conducted evaluations to explore the benefits of wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor materials for aircraft electrification The co-operation will focus on developing SiC and GaN devices, packages, and modules adapted for Airbus' aerospace applications. The companies will assess these components by conducting advanced research and tests on demonstrators, such as e-motor control units, high and low voltage power converters, and wireless power transfer systems. This collaboration with ST will be key to support Airbus' electrification roadmap, according to Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer. "Aerospace is a highly demanding market with specific requirements. Cooperating with Airbus, a global leader in this industry, gives us the opportunity to define together new power technologies the industry needs to realise its decarbonisation goals," indicated Jerome Roux, ST's president for sales & marketing.
