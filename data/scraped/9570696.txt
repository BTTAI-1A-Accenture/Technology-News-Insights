Untold: Johnny Football dropped on Netflix, a look at Johnny Manziel’s rise from Texas A&M star and fall after being released from the Cleveland Browns. It reveals Manziel’s mental health struggles — a warning, there’s talk of a suicide attempt — allegations of misconduct and so much more. The clip that’s being shared the most is his former agent, Erik Burkhardt and Manziel himself discussing how much film he watched as an NFL QB. Apparently, the Cleveland GM at the time called Burkhardt and asked why Manziel had watched “0.00 hours” on the iPad he was given. Manziel confirmed it: “Zero” hours watched.
