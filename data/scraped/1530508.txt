From thrilling ski resorts and relaxing hot springs to vibrant winter festivals, there’s something for everyone. Mini-me’s mini-me is unlikely to actually participate in a Northern invasion as his army is even worse than the Russians and it would surely cause an insurrection by the Belarusian population. More likely he allows “his” country  to be used as a staging ground for an invasion and as a logistical hub/air space.  The problem with the dwarf midget’s “plan” (this doesn’t qualify as a strategy) is that it will rely on the same decimated units (or worse) using more inexperienced cannon fodder, with even worse equipment against a UA that has cut its teeth and is ready to fight on equal terms. Its function is not like a regular drone, so kamikaze is an adjective that describes its purpose. On the other hand, missiles are usually supposed to blow up something, so calling them kamikaze missiles is just a waste of typing. Or, it's a MSM conspiracy. Up to you to decide! I see a lot of word play in the media on this topic. What is the difference between a "kamikaze" drone and a cruise missile like a Tomahawk? Is the Tomahawk a "kamikaze" missile? What is the difference between a "kamikaze" drone and a cruise missile like a Tomahawk? Massive difference. A flying scooter drone that Russia uses was not designed to hit strategic targets, it was designed for terrorist to use to terrorise civilian population. It's not accurate, easily jammed with consumer grade drone hamming devices, and its very loud (you can hear it comin'). The Tomahawk is designed to hit strategic targets with precision. It's a strategic military missile. Any how, these drones are becoming very predictable. Every time Russia has a setback on the 'real' battlefield, Putin orders flying scooters to be sent to Kyiv, indiscriminately. Putin is such a bully! The Tomahawk is designed to hit strategic targets with precision. It's a strategic military missile. No, not true.  Tomahawk is a tactical weapon. In fact the current version is called TACtical TOMahawk, or TACTOM for short.  Strategic weapons are those that can fly from one continent to another and deliver nuclear weapons.  Even the old nuclear armed version of Tomahawk was considered a tactical weapons. Funny the kind of individual who considers accounts of a large nuclear armed nation attacking a much smaller one destroying their homes, schools, hospitals and electrical power infrastructure "liberal propaganda".  What kind of person says that?  It amazes me sometimes to think about who might be standing next to me in the grocery store check out line. If Lukashenko makes the fatal error of invading Ukrainian territory, NATO would have the perfect excuse of taking him and his henchmen out, a move that would knock over Putin's domino. Bring it on! More attrocities by Russia's aggressors and PUTAin! More destruction of civilian infrastructer and now even trying to pull Belarus into this insane war! The man definitely is desperate and running out of "supplies". Little man PUTAin will meet his destiny, hopefully sooner than later! Ukraine will prevail! Russia's terrorist actions in targeting power infrastructure should be getting a much bigger reaction from the international community.  The EU and Western backers need to be supplying long range missiles to hit deep inside Russian territory to hit military targets, military factories and fuel and ammunition storage dumps, until Russia stops hitting civilian infrastructure. The bridge from Russia to Ukraine needs to be completely destroyed in a number of places so it will never be rebuilt. Russia has proven beyond any doubt it is a terrorist nation. It must pay a high price for its actions. Sounds like Mr Putin has taken a look at Mr Hitler’s tactics t demoralise the British in WWII. The attacks on London during the Blitz were intended to have a negative effect on the citizens but in fact strengthened their resolve. Let’s see how it plays out as winter takes hold. Mini-me thinks that he will be safe from facing the consequences of his obvious war crimes.  He MAY be right but I hope not. I really hope that after Ukraine is no longer occupied by an aggressor over a made up bs lie, the dwarf midget faces a reckoning for this war and his ordering of it including war crimes that he specifically ordered.
