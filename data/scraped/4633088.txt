HomeNewsFull throttle for CARSOME's USD 150 mil growth engine Hans Â·  Jun 10, 2023 11:30 AM    In response to news reports alleging that CARSOME is seeking investment from the Malaysian Ministry of Finance, the online retailer of pre-owned cars said, âCARSOME Group seeks to clarify a recent news report and affirm that it has not solicited nor petitioned the Ministry of Finance for funding. It submitted a letter on 27 March 2023 in response to an engagement session with the Ministry of Finance to encourage and welcome the participation of Malaysian institutional investors in the companyâs growth journey. âThe Group frequently engages in discussions with various stakeholders on ecosystem building and in driving institutional engagements. As part of these routine engagements, CARSOME has always championed growth for the local start-up ecosystem which can positively contribute towards the nationâs economy and enhance the nationâs digital talent pool.â As for its path to profitability, CARSOME said: âIt is worth noting that the Groupâs liquidity position remains robust at over USD 150 million, offering the company sufficient runway beyond its break-even point, which the Group expects to achieve well ahead of its targeted deadline. âCARSOME said it was among the first regional start-ups to commit to an accelerated profitability plan to prepare the Group for more disruptions and challenges in the funding markets. This approach has borne fruit, delivering operational profitability as a group whilst enabling CARSOME to beat internal targets for gross margin growth and productivity improvements as of Q1 2023. âIn 2022, the Group grew 250% in revenue, with the newly established retail line CARSOME Certified contributing 35% of total revenue. In Q1 2023, the Group achieved its operational profitability milestone for the first time, primarily driven by a significant growth of trade margin, which doubled compared to the same period last year. Notably, more than 80% of the trade margin came from high-quality transaction margins, far ahead of most of its global peers.â CEO Eric Cheng said, âAs we navigate a rapidly changing industry, CARSOME has embraced adaptability and remained resilient. Through our commitment to operational excellence and our customer-centric approach, we are grateful to have exceeded our expectations, achieving notable growth whilst pursuing profitability. We are grateful for the Governmentâs support towards a homegrown brand such as ours as we scale regionally. âThe Groupâs internal measures for operational excellence, driven by strong capabilities in data and technology, continue to yield gross margin improvements, team productivity, marketing efficiencies, and inventory management across its markets. Coupled with this, CARSOME will take full advantage of its ecosystem strategy to redefine customer satisfaction in automotive ownership to serve its growing customer base and communities across Southeast Asia.â The e-commerce space is a very challenging one. CARSOME explained that it is one of the last few larger players in the used car e-commerce space in Southeast Asia. Some of its competitors are reported to be exiting prime growth markets like Indonesia and Thailand. Other peers are pivoting into capital-intensive financing operations. âCARSOMEâs focus remains on solving the pain points in high stake, high-complexity transactions and providing the ultimate customer experience in automotive ownership,â said the company.
