 Matteo Bocelli has had a very busy last year releasing singles Solo, Close and Dime. The 25-year-old also performed on the Bocelli family Christmas album with his father Andrea Bocelli and sister Virginia Bocelli. After a well-earned rest following concerts all around the world as a trio, he’s now gearing up to release his debut solo album later this year. Ahead of this, he’s put out a new single in a collaboration with Sukriti Kakar and Prakriti Kakar.

On his social media, he describes the track as “a heart-breaking song for this romantic time of the year. It's beautiful how languages and cultures blend together in one song. I thought it would be difficult to write English lyrics for a Hindi song, but the melody made it easy and romantic.
