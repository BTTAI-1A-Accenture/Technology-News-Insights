                 Order your next meal from Senheng’s new food delivery service S-Food and stand a chance to win amazing prizes. 
 THE joys of purchasing food we love online is not foreign and is a welcome addition as we grow into a digitalised lifestyle. As we see more apps mushrooming, picking one that is just right for you is crucial. A household name in electrical appliances, Senheng will be launching its new and enhanced Senheng app dubbed a super app, in stages. Kicking-off the launch recently is its food delivery platform, S-Food. During the virtual launch for S-Food, Senheng founder and chairman KH Lim said: “PlusOne members used to be able to only earn S-Coin cashback by shopping consumer electronic products and PlusOne members could only be recruited via Senheng retail. So we decided to outsource our customer relationship management (CRM) to S Ecosystem and a new super app could be born.” He shared that S-Coin is “as good as cash” – collect as many coins as you want to then make purchases at Senheng or senQ outlets nationwide. S Ecosystem general manager Lew Wai Hoong said: “We are partnering with Revenue Monster’s alacarte food ordering platform to provide food delivery service to our PlusOne members. There are almost one thousand merchants and more coming, including household names like Tealive, Empire Sushi, Kenny Rogers, Dragon-I, BMS Organics among others.” Revenue Monster chief commercial officer Ken Lim said: “We are working with third party delivery partners like Grab Express, PandaGo and Lalamove. Merchants would be able to choose who they want to work with.” According to S Ecosystem deputy general manager YY Lim, the Senheng App consists of 16 lifestyle products and services that incorporate the S-Coin Reward System such as S-Food, Senheng Official Store, Mobile Reloads, Ticketing, Home Fix, among others. He shared there is no limit to how much members can earn in S-Coin and the S-Coin has a validity of two years for PlusOne members to redeem. Earn as you spend If you are one of some three million PlusOne members, you can order food delivery from a wide range of food merchants and restaurants while earning high S-Coin cashback. Fret not if you are not a PlusOne member just yet, as it only takes a few simple steps to register yourself on the Senheng app, which would make you a PlusOne member instantly. For every S-Food order completed, PlusOne members will earn high S-Coin cashback of up to 20%. The app features multiple payment methods and options for you to make your orders like delivery, pick-up, drive-thru and contactless delivery. As part of the S-Food launching promotion, PlusOne members can earn up to 36% S-Coin Cashback, from Nov 1-4, 2021. The additional cashback reward is limited to the first order per PlusOne member only. How you can participate In addition, PlusOne members get to join the S-FOOD je! campaign from Nov 1-30, 2021. All you have to do is follow these simple steps: Step 1: Order food from S-FOOD in Senheng app. Step 2: Follow @senhengapp on both Facebook and Instagram.
