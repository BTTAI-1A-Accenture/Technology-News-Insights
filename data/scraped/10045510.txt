Los Angeles, CA (June 20, 2023) - Yanmar, a global innovator in a wide range of industrial
equipment, is delighted to announce its participation in Anime Expo 2023 (AX2023) from July
1 to 4, at the Los Angeles Convention Center. At this prestigious event, Yanmar will proudly
present its animation project, “未ル(Miru)”, an exciting tale where the main character embarks
on an epic adventure in a world where robots coexist, while nature faces a looming threat. The
anime also showcases a robot that originated from an original concept by Yanmar's own
designers. Yanmar will highlight its presence at AX2023 with a dynamic booth located in the entrance
area. At the booth, attendees will be captivated by a giant model of the heroic robot, providing
an immersive experience that brings Miru to life on a grand scale. To further engage with the
audience, Yanmar will host a compelling panel discussion led by Chief Branding Officer, Akihiro
Nagaya. “With Miru, we aim to inspire viewers and illustrate the profound connection between humans,
machines, and nature,” said Nagaya. “Miru is a testament to Yanmar's commitment to realizing
prosperous and exciting lifestyles in harmony with nature.” As a leading global manufacturer of industrial machinery, Yanmar is undergoing a
transformative journey by leveraging technology to become a provider of solutions in various
domains, including food production, energy, urban spaces, and excitement. Miru exemplifies
Yanmar's vision and represents the seamless integration of technology and human
experiences. Miru explores the theme of “confrontation and harmony between humans and nature” in the
context of a global movement towards a sustainable society. The protagonist will navigate
challenges and personal growth, striving to preserve the environment required for our
existence, while the presence of robots will be depicted alongside their journey. The anime
emphasizes the importance of finding balance between humanity and the natural world,
aligning with the global call for sustainable living. The name 未ル(Miru) is coined by combining the character for “future” (Mi) with the Japanese
character “Ru” to indicate positive action and initiative in creating the future. Yanmar looks
forward to joining its viewers in supporting the characters as they create their own future as
the series unfolds. Yanmar's participation in Anime Expo 2023 signifies its commitment to innovation, creative
storytelling, and connecting with diverse audiences. The company invites fans, media
representatives, and industry professionals to join them at AX2023, experience the
enchantment of Miru, and explore the limitless possibilities that Yanmar has to offer. Outline of Miru

awareness of Yanmar to a global audience. Furthermore, we aim to enhance understanding of

society into the story of the anime. Comment from Akihiro Nagaya, Director and Chief Branding Officer of Yanmar
Holdings
Anime is a medium that allows us to combine immersive storytelling and world-building with
the future as envisioned by Yanmar. The interactions between humans and machines, the
coexistence of humans and nature, and the story of the protagonist challenging themselves
and growing by believing in their own potential are all rooted in Yanmar's values of HANASAKA
and the underlying excitement (WAKUWAKU). The fictional world of anime and the real world
in which we exist influence each other to create a unified worldview. Through anime, we aim
to accomplish this ambitious endeavor. We hope that the excitement (WAKUWAKU) generated by Yanmar will resonate with everyone
who watches the anime, becoming a powerful catalyst for realizing a more prosperous society. Robot Design
Yanmar's in-house Design Office, which is involved in the design of Yanmar's agricultural and
construction machinery as well as various graphics, was responsible for the original concept
of the robot design. The Design Office looks to imagine situations where the products will be
used and how they interact with the customers, to create essential designs that truly resonate
with users. For this robot design, the team was conscious of incorporating a design with
essential meaning, just like the company's product designs. Based on the belief that robots
exist for the sake of humans, the design combines an organic form that embraces people and
a strong, functional component. Through the juxtaposition of contrasting elements, the design
expresses a unique sense of aesthetics. Anime Expo 2023
