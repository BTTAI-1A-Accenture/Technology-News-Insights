 Authored by Paige Baker Over the years, there has been a surge in venture funding in major cities like New York, Los Angeles, Miami and London, but the Midwest has often been overlooked as a booming tech scene. In the last year alone, the Midwest secured $16 billion in funding, $10.2 billion of that coming from Chicago, an increase of $6.6 billion from 2021. As Chicago gears up for another record year, we take a closer look at where the funding is being allocated and the trends emerging in this rapidly developing market.  In this installment of Spotlight On, we sat down with Sonia Sahney Nagar, General Partner at Pritzker Group, to gain insights into the Chicago/Midwest venture landscape. As a Michigan native, Sonia provides a unique perspective on why she chose to establish herself in this area and become a leading investor in some of the most sought-after consumer and commerce-enabling businesses like Wander Beauty, ShopThing, BACH, and Maisonette. She discusses how her experience as an entrepreneur informs her approach to identifying promising founders and startups, as well as her strategies for attracting top talent to their portfolios.  To start off, can you take us through your career journey and how you ended up in venture? I majored in Mechanical Engineering and taught myself how to program which helped me land my first job in the advanced engineering group at General Motors. But when I looked at who was at the top of the company, the ones making decisions on strategy and which direction the business would go, they all had MBAs. I wanted to be a decision-maker and decided that my next step would be to get my MBA, which is how I made my first pivot from engineering to business.  While in business school, I had a brief stint in investment banking where I got to work on the IPO team for a company in the payments space. Throughout that process, I got to know the founders and work directly with them in this monumental stage of their business, and felt like I was on the wrong side of the table. At that point, I had both an engineering and a business background, and decided I wanted to pivot into the founder space.  The issue was, I didn’t have an idea that I wanted to build quite yet. At that time, Amazon was in the process of launching their clothing category, and their pitch was that they would help emerging founders get the experience of building a business with their support, so I joined them in 2008 and helped launch the clothing category of the business.  But my dream to be a founder was still strong. When I left Amazon, I made the pivot to become a management consultant which was a real training ground to help me build my confidence in pitching to VCs and corporate partners. I negotiated a sabbatical from consulting and started my first startup called Pickie, which was later acquired by RetailMeNot, where I moved up to become the VP of Product. I left to move back to the Midwest to start a family intending to take a few months off, but started meeting with VCs in Chicago to build relationships with them because I knew I wanted to eventually build  another startup.  One of those conversations was with Pritzker Group Venture Capital who happened to be hiring, and I joined them as a VC, investing in consumer companies and marketplaces. How was your transition from founder/CEO to General Partner? And how has your experience as a founder influenced the operators you vet, back, and invest in today?   Being an investor is so different from being a founder, but having been in the founder seat, I am very empathetic to the founder experience and deeply understand how grueling it is. And I do think that founders like working with investors who have the experience of being a founder, which definitely helps me when selling my experience. On the flip side, having been a founder has also helped me make decisions as an investor. One of the biggest things I look for is whether the founder is mission-driven and if they have, what I call, “founder-market fit”. Can they convince me that they are the best person to solve the problem they are looking to solve and that their life experiences to date have given them some advantage in this endeavor? Relatedly, do they have the grit to withstand all of the economic uncertainty, the setbacks, the potential to fail? We need to believe that the company can get to a billion-dollar outcome, and that’s usually a 10+ year tumultuous journey with lots of ups and downs, so I look for people who I believe can not only make the journey, but also have the selling and storytelling skills to build a team and bring investors and customers with them. The Midwest, Chicago specifically, is not a “new” area for innovative startups and Tech companies, as we’ve seen nearly $10B in VC dollars deployed here in 2022 alone. Yet, it is not as well known as Silicon Beach or Silicon Valley which have seen explosive growth for decades now. Why Chicago and what do you think the roadmap looks like in 5 years from now?  There are so many businesses being built that make the most sense to build in the Midwest, as we are still the heart of manufacturing, supply chain & logistics, agriculture tech, food tech and more. One of our regions’ weaknesses also drives our strength, as we have lower median round sizes and fewer earlier stage funds than on the coasts, but that means Midwest founders are typically more capital efficient and push to build real businesses with good business fundamentals earlier. On the talent front, there is a growing population here who have boomeranged from the coasts where they initially built their careers, and have come back to the Midwest because they want a different quality of life and to make an impact.  Looking ahead to the next 5 years, we definitely need more capital. We already have a pretty strong ecosystem here, and I think COVID has actually helped the Midwest in the sense that businesses are now being built remotely so teams can be distributed. If people choose to live in the Midwest for family or personal reasons, they are able to do so while also getting job experiences with startups in other areas, or vice versa, companies are being built in the Midwest and can hire from other areas of the country without filtering talent based on geography. COVID has unlocked a lot of talent access, so it’s a great time to build, and it’s especially a good time to build in the Midwest.  The narrative for the industry is changing as companies take on a more defensive stance in response to market volatility. How should founders position themselves to weather the economic storm and set themselves up for success? I would say that we probably have about 12 to 18 months of uncertainty here where people are going to be more conservative, so capital efficiency is key. Being able to stretch your runway without relying on outside capital and making strides to break even faster is being rewarded more so now than ever.  If you’ve already raised some money, continuing to build great relationships with your investors is a key strategy to weather this storm. If you hit hard times or you need a couple of more months to get your series A or series B metrics, your investors will be motivated to help you if you build strong relationships. And you build that by having transparency and building trust. So sharing more frequent updates, being transparent about your KPIs and your metrics, what’s going well and what’s not. That is how you build relationships in peacetime and wartime, and given the uncertainty around whether we’re going to be in  wartime for a longer period of time, it is more important than ever to build those relationships now with investors or even with people you don’t know yet but would like to raise money from.  You’re focused mainly in the consumer and commerce enablement worlds – are there any new technology or sub sectors that you feel will emerge as “leaders” in their space? There’s a lot of hype right now around AI which has been around forever, but hasn’t necessarily been understandable to the general public before ChatGPT. So I think a lot of folks are starting to think about how AI is going to impact their jobs, what they do, and who they hire. For my purposes, I'm mostly focused on AI and how that's going to impact experiences and products and the enterprise software platforms that support selling products that we invest in.  Being on both the business side and now the venture side, how important is having top talent versus just a good business model? Talent is everything. The thing that I've realized more than anything is that having the right hire, especially as a startup, is one of the most important assets you need, and the ability to hire well is probably one of the most important qualities you need to have as a founder. Especially in the early days since you get to make so few hires, you’re going to have a super small team, and you want to be sure that you have the right people on your side to be able to scale your business.
