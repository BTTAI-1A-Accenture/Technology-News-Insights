CHICAGO, July 10, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The laboratory information system (LIS) industry is set to witness significant growth and transformation in the near future. With the increasing demand for integrated and streamlined healthcare solutions, LIS is expected to play a vital role in optimizing laboratory operations, enhancing data management, and improving patient care. Advancements in technology, such as cloud computing, interoperability, and data analytics, will revolutionize the LIS landscape, enabling seamless integration with electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine platforms, and other healthcare systems. This integration will facilitate efficient data exchange, enhance communication between healthcare professionals, and support evidence-based decision-making. Furthermore, the emergence of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will enable automated data interpretation, quality control, and predictive analytics, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy, faster turnaround times, and enhanced patient outcomes. The LIS industry will also witness increased emphasis on cybersecurity and data privacy to safeguard patient information. Overall, the future of the LIS industry holds tremendous potential to revolutionize laboratory workflows, enhance healthcare delivery, and drive innovation in diagnostic medicine. Laboratory Information System (LIS) Market in terms of revenue was estimated to be worth $2.4 billion in 2023 and is poised to reach $4.0 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 10.8% from 2023 to 2028 according to a new report by MarketsandMarkets. Factors such as the need for laboratory automation, the development of integrated LIS, and growing investments in the adoption of EHR systems and subsequent integration with LIS primarily drive the growth of this market. Furthermore, the rising emergence of AI and advanced analytics, growing demand for LIS in biobanks and biorepositories, and rising demand for personalized medicine would provide lucrative opportunities to solution providers. AI-powered algorithms can automate routine tasks in the laboratory, such as sample handling, data entry, and result validation. AI can analyze images from laboratory tests, such as histopathology slides or radiology scans, to aid in the diagnosis and detection of abnormalities. Machine learning algorithms can learn from large datasets and provide accurate interpretations, assisting pathologists and radiologists in their evaluations. This reduces manual errors, improves turnaround times, and frees up laboratory staff for more complex tasks.
