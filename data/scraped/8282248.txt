With concerns mounting over the impact AI-generated books are having on the e-book market, Amazon has created some new guidelines. Specifically, in a post late yesterday in the KDP Community Forum, the company introduced new AI guidelines for those using the Kindle Direct Publishing platform. The most significant change is that Amazon will now require users to “inform us of AI-generated content (text, images, or translations) when you publish a new book or make edits to and republish an existing book through KDP.” The post goes on to say that even if a user made substantial edits after initially creating the content using AI, that would be considered AI-generated. The guidelines draw a distinction between AI-generated content and AI-assisted content, with Amazon saying that anyone who created content themselves using AI-based tools to “edit, refine, error-check, or otherwise improve that content” does not need to report that usage. Regardless of how a book is created, KDP stressed that users are expected to follow all guidelines: “You are responsible for verifying that all AI-generated and/or AI-assisted content adheres to all content guidelines. For example, to confirm an AI-based tool did not create content based on copyrighted works, you're required to review and edit any AI tool outputs.” It isn’t clear what Amazon will do with the information it receives. In the post, the company states that “we are actively monitoring the rapid evolution of generative AI and the impact it is having on reading, writing, and publishing, and we remain committed to providing the best possible shopping, reading, and publishing experience for our authors and customers. “ At least for the time being, the company does not intend to publicly identify what books have been wholly created by AI, but a source said that could change in the future. The post closes by noting that KDP “will continue to keep the interests of our authors, publishers, and readers at the forefront of our thinking and decision-making.” The Authors Guild and others have raised concerns about AI-generated books flooding the market. The issue generated considerable attention last month when author and consultant Jane Friedman wrote about books being sold on Amazon under her name that she did not write.  Loading... Password
