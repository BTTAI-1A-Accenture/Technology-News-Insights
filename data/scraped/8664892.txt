 We’ve just survived a once-in-a-generation freeze, so my advice may be a little late. But since it’s only December, we have plenty of cold weather running to look forward to in the coming months. How cold is too cold? That’s a question I’m often asked by those who know I run. After all my decades of winters, I still haven’t come up with a solid answer. I once ran a 10k in Penn Township when a sudden snowstorm blew through as we waited for the race start at Butler Airport. I wisely kept my warm-up clothes on to fight a howling wind and almost zero visibility in blinding snow. From that race, I learned that one key to surviving winter running is to block the wind. An outer layer of windproof jacket, mittens and in brutal cold, wind pants, act as a magic shield against that howling maelstrom. Look for a jacket that not only blocks the wind but allows excess heat to escape. Dress in layers. That helps whether you’re running, hiking or jogging your dog Buddy through the park in January. Start with a moisture-wicking base layer because even in the coldest temperatures, your body produces heat and sweat. Add insulating middle layers as needed under your final wind block, but avoid cotton since it retains moisture. Contrary to urban myth, you can’t freeze your lungs by running in severe cold. But cold winter is dry and inhaling deeply can dry the throat and bronchial tubes and leave you coughing. To pre-warm your breath, wear a scarf or buff loosely over your mouth. And stick to an easy running pace so you don’t have to gulp air so deeply. If you’re not used to running in the extreme cold or suffer from asthma, ease into it. Cold can induce an asthma attack in susceptible individuals. I learned to play in the cold long before running was a popular thing. Mom dressed my sister and I like Randy in “A Christmas Story” and sent us out to build snow forts and zoom down the front yard on our aluminum flying saucers. We could barely move in boots over double socks and mittens as big as oven mitts and could hardly see with scarves wrapped over our noses. You don’t have to dress like a classic movie character to run in the cold, but in blustery weather, it helps to double-insulate appendages like noses, fingers, toes, and private parts. My mom also smeared a coating of Vaseline on our cheeks and forehead as a barrier against the wind and wet snow. When I was a kid, every snow day was like Christmas, and I never wanted it to end. We’d stay outside until our toes and fingers were numb, then endure the pain of thawing frozen parts in warm water. When running outside, even if you’ve prepared, recognize the dangers of the cold. You can experience frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes. You may be in serious trouble if you’re five miles and 50 minutes from home. Instead of an out-and-back that leaves you far away from warmth, run several short loops. You can swing by the house, warm up and swap out any damp clothing, then continue your run. Also, recognize the signs of hypothermia. If you experience shivering, drowsiness, slow pulse or slurred speech, seek warmth immediately. Don’t try to tough it out or you may end up in the ER — or worse! Even on the coldest days, it is possible to overdress and over-sweat. A good rule of thumb is to dress as if it’s 20 degrees warmer. You can also use your hat as a heat regulator — on when you’re cold, off when you begin to sweat. If you just can’t face that chill of the first few minutes of running before you’re warmed up, toss your running clothes in the dryer for a few minutes and they’ll be cozy when you step out the door. And do your pre-run stretches indoors so you’ll be ready when your feet first hit the road. In extreme weather, it’s extremely important to plan. Check the weather report for predictions of sudden snow squalls or ice storms moving in. And as always, if you run alone, be sure to notify someone of your plans before you go. Better yet, invite someone to join you for a few frosty miles.
