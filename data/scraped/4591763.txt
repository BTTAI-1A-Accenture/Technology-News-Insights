According to this tech giant, players will need an AMD Ryzen™ 7 7800X3D CPU, an AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XT GPU, and an AMD X670 motherboard to run Starfield with 4K resolution.
                         AMD’s system requirements come in three tiers: Legendary, Epic, and Heroic, with each offering a different performance.

                         AMD A620
      Starfield’s partnership with AMD has caused many controversies, as players believe the suggested bundle is more of a marketing attempt than an actual spec recommendation. Experts claim that AMD’s system requirements include newly released items that—although powerful—are expensive.
                         On top of the partnership controversies, Bethesda’s secrecy and ambiguity surrounding the game’s 60FPS performance have caused complaints. Even in AMD’s specifications for the game, the Epic setting offers “higher FPS” without specifying the actual frame rate.
      Starfield will be available on September 6, 2023, for PC and Xbox Series X/S.
