In the next round of the Wuhan Open snooker event, Ricky Walden and Ian Burns will compete against each other at the Wuhan Sports Center. This match has Ricky Walden pegged as the favorite, and the Englishman will be looking to capitalize on any opportunities that present itself. Ricky Walden did pick up three victories in his prior encounters, with those victories coming against Lukas Kleckers, Jamie Jones, and Michael White in matches with respective scores of 5-3, 3-5, and 5-4. However, he was defeated in the qualification round for the British Open by Xu Si and in the first round of the European Masters by Ashley Carty. Both of these losses came at the hands of their respective opponents. We have no choice but to anticipate a strong showing from the Englishman here, despite the fact that he will be hoping he can get back to being at his best and win the competition. The last two matches that Ian Burns has played have both resulted in defeat. His most recent losses were at the hands of Noppon Saengkham and Ma Hailong, and they were decided by scores of 5-2 and 4-2, respectively. However, despite the fact that his recent performances have been erratic, Ian Burns will still believe that he can take something away from this battle, as it is anticipated that he will continue to fight until the very end of this one. When looking at the results of Ian Burns's most recent six matches, we see that he has only one victory to show for them, while the other five matches resulted in either a tie or a loss. Because of their high level of play and extensive experience, both of these players are sure to put on a show for the crowd during this match, so we have another exciting encounter to look forward to. Even though Ricky Walden has a better chance of winning this, it will be extremely difficult to get rid of Ian Burns as well. In the meantime, I believe that I will have to go along with the bookies and put my money on Ricky Walden to win this match since I believe that he is the better player in this match overall.
