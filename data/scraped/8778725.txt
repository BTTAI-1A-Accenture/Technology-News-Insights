         CHICAGO (CBS) -- Chicago Executive Airport in northwest suburban Wheeling had to shut down suddenly Monday afternoon, when a plane went off the runway. Just after 1 p.m., a plane slid off the runway and onto the grass.  No one was hurt. The airport was closed for about three hours until they removed the aircraft. The plane was a Gulfstream G100, which can fly long distances and typically seats up to nine passengers.
