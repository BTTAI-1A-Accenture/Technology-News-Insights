Share Cloudera, the hybrid data company, has unveiled an expansion of its Open Data Lakehouse offerings, allowing users to harness the power of analytics and AI capabilities for all their data within their enterprises, whether it resides in the cloud or on-premises. This move builds upon Cloudera’s previous introduction of support for Apache Iceberg V2 in its CDP-Public Cloud offering last year, enabling seamless access to emerging technologies like large language models (LLMs) and real-time self-service analytics at scale. Notably, Cloudera stands apart as the sole provider of an open data lakehouse that spans multiple public clouds and on-premises environments, retaining their data where it is best suited. Moreover, the unified security and governance offered by CDP ensures consistent data access and protection, irrespective of its structure or format. Ram Venkatesh, Cloudera’s Chief Technology Officer, expressed enthusiasm about the enhancement, stating, “Large enterprises want to extract business value from all their data using AI and data analytics. Our announcement today of Apache Iceberg support on private clouds means our best-in-class Open Data Lake House just continues to get better.” He further emphasised that customers can now leverage the power of Iceberg “everywhere” they need it to be. Mayank Baid, Regional Vice President, India, Cloudera, highlighted the challenges faced by businesses in centralising their structured and unstructured data and the growing demand for actionable insights. Baid remarked, “To stay ahead of the curve, we are expanding our best-in-class Open Data Lakehouse and announcing support for Apache Iceberg for CDP-Private Cloud, which enables organisations to fully utilise the value of their data and delivers Iceberg ‘everywhere’ the customers need it to be.” Cloudera’s latest development reflects the increasing need for businesses to unlock the potential of their data through advanced analytics and AI, catering to the evolving demands of enterprises striving for centralised data management and agility in generating valuable insights. With its Open Data Lakehouse and Apache Iceberg integration, Cloudera aims to provide organisations with a comprehensive solution for maximising the value of their data assets. 📣 Want to advertise in AIM?
