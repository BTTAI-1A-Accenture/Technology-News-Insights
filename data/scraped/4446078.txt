ExpandInside, the large dining space is split between tables for larger parties and reservations and a standing room bar for walk-in diners who may just want to grab a drink or have a cocktail before dinner.

Diners can peer directly into the large kitchen, a model that can be found at other Joey locations as well. Art from local artists lines on of the walls and a unique Bocci light installation hangs above the tables in front of the kitchen.The space, which previously housed Hawaiian and Japanese fusion restaurant Roy’s, was completely re-done.“We had to re-do everything, we can’t just put on a new coat of paint for the type of work we want to do here,” Executive Director of Culinary for the Joey Restaurant Group Matthew Stowe said.The new opening is less nerve-wracking because Joey has already made itself known in Southern California, Stowe said.Related Articles
