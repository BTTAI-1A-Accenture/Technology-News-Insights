Investors are closely monitoring the new Pepe-related token‚Äôs impressive price rally, hoping for a potential recovery after the setback with Pepe Coin.  In April, a separate project emerged, closely associated with the well-known Pepe, and was subsequently listed on Binance in May under the same ticker symbol, PEPE. However, it wasn‚Äôt until August 25 that the new Pepe Community token made its debut on Uniswap. This revitalized $PEPE aims to adhere to the core principles of DeFi and memecoins, fostering an open market where all participants enjoy equal treatment, enabling them to transact freely without restrictions or tax burdens. The #PepeCommunity has demonstrated incredible resilience and determination. Together, we are turning the $Pepe project into a vibrant community which embraces the DeFi ethics. This in turn empowers each and all individuals.  So #PepeArmy, let's continue building a future where‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/vIzKZYJ5RY ‚Äî Pepe Community üê∏ (@PepeCommunity_) August 30, 2023  Importantly, $PEPE operates without centralized ownership, and its liquidity pair has been intentionally removed to protect the community from potential harm. This authentic $PEPE represents a community-driven initiative focused on memetic warfare against normies while upholding the principles of financial freedom integral to DeFi. The development of the new Pepe coin was a reaction to the larger market cap of Pepe, which currently stands at $314 million, a significant decline from its peak of nearly $2 billion, partly due to the blacklisting of certain wallet addresses on its launch day and the facing of insider trading allegations following a significant price crash last week. The Pepe Coin team announced on Twitter that certain team members had been able to steal about 16 trillion tokens from the multisig CEX wallet. These tokens were then sold on the market, causing the price of Pepe Coin to plummet. However, the Pepe Coin team has since regained control of the tokens and plans to burn the remaining tokens in the multisig wallet. Pepe Community has experienced a remarkable ascent since its inception. Launching at a price of $0.0032, the token reached an all-time high of $0.0451 on August 28th, marking an astounding price surge of over 1000%.  This impressive price increase occurred amid a correction of nearly 40% in the past month for Pepe Coin. The token‚Äôs surge commenced on August 28th, rapidly gaining momentum. In less than six hours, its price surged from $0.004 to $0.027, briefly encountering resistance at $0.03, momentarily halting its ascent. Although the token faced a minor setback, dropping to $0.019, it demonstrated resilience by rebounding and surpassing the previous resistance at $0.03. On the day following August 29th, the token nearly reached $0.04 but encountered substantial resistance, compelling it to retreat after reaching $0.0369. As the day concluded, $PEPE experienced a final surge, breaking through all previous resistance levels and reaching $0.045, only to lose momentum and witness a sharp price decline to $0.0156. Earlier that day, it had reached this level but swiftly rebounded to nearly $0.03. However, it encountered resistance once more, pushing it down to approximately $0.02. The token underwent another drop before establishing a new support level at $0.025. From there, it made another attempt to surge, yielding similar outcomes. At the time of writing, the token is trading at the $0.01 mark. Given its favorable initial performance, there is potential for further price increases in the coming weeks and months. Pepe Community‚Äôs promising start has attracted traders who are shifting their investments from heavyweight meme coins like Pepe and HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu to explore lesser-known projects with the potential for substantial returns. Despite the information presented on CoinMarketCap, Pepe Community is reported to currently possess a blacklist function, as indicated in the audit scan section on DEXTools. This discovery references sources like GoPlus, TokenSniffer, and Hapi.  A blacklist function serves as a tool that developers can employ to restrict specific wallets from engaging in regular trading activities, such as selling their holdings to capitalize on profits. Additionally, Pepe Community allegedly incorporates other features like ‚Äòtrading cooldown‚Äô and ‚Äòantiwhale‚Äô mechanisms, which can control the timing between buy or sell transactions or impose limits on the maximum token holdings within wallets. Notably, TokenSniffer has assigned Pepe Community a perfect score of 100/100, DEXTScore rates it at 99/99, and its community trust rating stands at 95.9% based on 293 votes.  It‚Äôs worth noting that some new Uniswap tokens have experienced rug pulls without any prior audit warnings, while others have received audit warnings yet investors encountered no issues while trading them. Emerging meme coins are now being considered as alternatives to $PEPE, raising questions about potential investments. While $PEPE‚Äôs declining price prompted some cryptocurrency users to withdraw, the spotlight shifted to Pepe Community this week, yet traders continue to explore other opportunities.
