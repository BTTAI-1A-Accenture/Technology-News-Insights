Discrimination against employees because of their health — including mental health — is illegal. While HR can make sure the right supports are in place, managers should also make sure that stigma isn’t impacting their day-to-day decisions about their teams. For example, how can a manager prevent their personal views on mental health from biasing their task assignment or performance reviews of an employee who’s disclosed a mental health challenge? To reduce the impact of stigma after a mental health disclosure, managers should acknowledge their biases, lead with curiosity, solve collaboratively, and promote a supportive work culture. Since the pandemic began, more employees have been experiencing mental health challenges and talking about their mental health at work. This means more managers have insight into their team members’ mental health. While that insight is helpful in providing support, it also raises an important question: How can managers make fair decisions after an employee shares a mental health challenge?
