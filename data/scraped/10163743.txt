	 YEREVAN, November 1. /ARKA/. Wildberrries, the largest online retailer in Russia, has announced the launch of a project designed to open branded partner order pick-up points in Armenia.


	 The company said now entrepreneurs in Armenia can independently open order pick-up points and receive income for delivery of goods: their average turnover per year increased 1.5 times to 4-5 million rubles (27-35 million drams) in month, and the Wildberries subsidy project will allow to quickly recoup their investment.


	 Since October 2021, entrepreneurs from Armenia have had the opportunity not only to sell their goods through Wildberries, but also to receive additional earnings in the form of commission from orders.


	 The Russian company said anyone can open an affiliate order pick-up point with Wildberries if they are a legal entity. To do this, entrepreneurs just need to register with the WBPoint mobile application based on iOS or Android and provide information about their premises.


	 The order pick-up point management is carried out using the WBPoint mobile application with all features available to entrepreneurs to work with orders and customers. The partner does not even need a cash register, since all settlements between buyers and sellers are carried out online. In the updated version, registration of several legal entities with one phone number of the owner is also available.


	 “Wildberries launched sales in Armenia in 2018. We see that the popularity of online shopping in the country continues to grow at a rapid pace, so we plan to significantly expand the network of Wildberries order pick-up points in cooperation with local businesses. Having become the owner of a partner point, entrepreneurs receive a stable income thanks to the large consumer traffic of Wildberries. Every day we have over 2.3 million orders and customer activity continues to grow,” the Wildberries said.


	 As support for their future partners, Wildberries provides subsidies in the form of increased remuneration from the turnover of the point in the first 4 months of work. Also, entrepreneurs will be able to purchase furniture from Wildberries in installments for the improvement of their premises.


	 The company hopes that such a subsidy program will allow entrepreneurs to quickly recoup investments in opening an order pick-up point, since the average payback period is about 3 months.


	 Wildberries now has more than 8.5 thousand order pick-up points in Russia. --0--
