Award-winning global remittance company TapTap Send carried out its corporate social responsibility with a $10,000 donation to help educate brilliant and needy students in Ghana. TapTap Send made the donation to Citi Fm/TV Foundation’s the Citi Opportunity Project on Education (COPE). Africa Growth Director of TapTap Send, Darryl Koku Mawutor Abraham, made the donation on behalf of the company. According to him, it forms part of their CSR obligations to help make society better. “This is our first contribution to education, but will definitely not be the last,” he said. COPE is a Corporate Social Responsibility initiative under the Citi Foundation in support of Ghanaians in need of support.

The project has over the years expended over GH¢250,000.00 yearly on an average of 65 tertiary students, who have benefited from the scheme.
