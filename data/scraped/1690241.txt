In Warren County, the Southeast Warren school district dismissed classes at 1:30 p.m. on Monday and canceled classes for Tuesday because so many kids are out sick. Families received an email alerting them of the changes. "Right now, we're seeing a lot of strep throat and some RSV in children and unfortunately the supply for these antibiotics and over-the-counter products are in very short supply," said John Forbes, the owner of Medicap Pharmacy. Forbes says the shortage is putting them in a tough position. Typically, his pharmacy fills multiple Amoxicillin prescriptions every day. "Right now we have just one bottle left in the pharmacy," Forbes said. Forbes says this is the first time he's seen a shortage this severe. His wholesalers tell him it'll be more than a week before they will be getting these critical medications. And keeping that in mind, Forbes says it's important to get your vaccinations to help stop the spread of illness. "By you getting the vaccines, you also protect yourself but you also protect people around you. So you can reduce the risk of spreading this virus to other people," Forbes said.
