A new maritime center on the coast of Esbjerg, Denmark, developed by Danish design firm WERK Arkitekter and Oslo-based Snøhetta has now opened to the public.  The collaborative duo was granted the opportunity to create the communal space after being crowned the winners of the maritime center competition in 2019. The structural project boasts an uneven wooden design and acts as a gathering hub for watersports clubs and casual harbor visitants. In addition, the coastal town’s residents can currently visit the interactive space, dubbed “The Lantern.”  The 2,800-square-meter structure sees mismatched windows throughout its perimeter that deliver angelic lighting inside and out, while a theatre-like staircase is directed toward the ocean for an enchanting view. Inspired by marine craftsmanship, the center features a vertical paneled design that represents the effect of light against water under the moonlight. 
Inside, you will find a range of multifaceted facilities and clubs alongside advanced boat storage, training areas, and workshops for social gatherings and learning opportunities.
