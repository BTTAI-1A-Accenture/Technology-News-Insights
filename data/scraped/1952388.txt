 What is a SaaS agreement?  “SaaS” stands for Software as a Service. SaaS agreements are legal contracts for software licensing of software applications or services managed by or for the SaaS provider and shared by multiple customers of the provider. How does this relate to cannabis?  As more and more states open their doors across the United States to legalizing medicinal and adult use marijuana, there are a rising number of third-party service providers in the software space interested in providing services to cannabis operators, including data analytics, customer management systems platforms, and HR or payroll software services to name a few. And many of these third parties do so via SaaS Agreements, linkable terms and conditions, or terms of service. How can your SaaS agreement be cannabis compliant?  On the operator side, these may seem like boilerplate terms of service. But many can require onerous terms and conditions that simply just don’t hold water to the complex regulatory environment that the cannabis industry brings. To ensure full compliance with your state’s cannabis laws, it’s prudent to send these terms and conditions over to your legal counsel for confirmation. Below are the top five legal issues that you should look out for in your software services agreements.
