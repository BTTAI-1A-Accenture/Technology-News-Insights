Department
of
Applied
Mathematics
has
30
faculty
members
and
over
100
graduate
students.
We
offer
undergraduate
plans
in
Applied
Mathematics
and
Mathematical
Physics
that
attract
outstanding
students.
The

discussing
how
their
work
helps
to

The Department of Applied Mathematics presented six Outstanding Teaching Assistant Awards and three Graduate Research Paper Awards in recognition of the exceptional work of our graduate students.  The Faculty of Mathematics Research Office recently announced its 2024 recipients of the Golden Jubilee Research Excellence Award. Graeme Smith, an associate professor in Applied Mathematics, was one of this year’s winners. The $10,000 Mehta-Jenner Scholarship is awarded to female graduate students in a Faculty of Mathematics master’s program who are conducting research on the assessment and/or mitigation of climate change. Investigating the distribution of dark matter in the universe has always been a crucial task. One approach to achieve this is by examining its astrophysical tracers, which provide not only insight into matter distribution but also hold rich information regarding the astrophysical processes involved in their formation and evolution.
