Craigslist allows a limited amount of HTML in its listing editor. You can use the HTML to enhance the styling of your Craigslist advertisement. When you use the "Bold" tag to change a line of text to bold style, the font size stays the same. If you want to bold the text and make it larger so it stands out, you can easily add the appropriate tags. Craigslist allows a limited amount of HTML in its listing editor.
