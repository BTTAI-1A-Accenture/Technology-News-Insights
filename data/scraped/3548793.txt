July 2023 – ABM, a leading provider of  integrated facility and aviation services, has secured a three-year cabin  cleaning contract with one of South America’s largest carriers - LATAM  Airlines. The partnership deepens ABM’s presence at London Heathrow Airport,  now serving 27 airlines and cleaning eight million seats every year. With over a decade of experience  working with Heathrow Airport and the airlines which operate there, the new  contract will see the ABM team cleaning a 150,000 seats annually for the  airline. Having recently announced seven new routes and a 26.5 percent increase in  passengers in June compared with 2022, LATAM Group’s growth plans very much  align with ABM’s.   ABM recently, doubled its cabin  cleaning presence at Manchester Airport, increasing headcount by 163 percent.
