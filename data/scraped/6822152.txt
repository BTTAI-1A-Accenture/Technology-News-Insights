Juniper Networks has revealed that Payments Network Malaysia (PayNet) has chosen Juniper’s campus solutions powered by Mist AI to enhance its networking capabilities.
The upgrade encompasses Juniper Networks EX Series and Wireless Access Points, Wired and Wi-Fi Assurance services, and Marvis Virtual Network Assistant, all driven by Mist AI, bolstering networking efficiency across PayNet’s campus sites and remote command center. As Malaysia’s principal financial market utility, PayNet facilitated MYR$1 trillion in consumer, business, and financial market transactions in 2022. Handling cross-border international payment linkages and providing a comprehensive array of services such as cashless payments (DuitNow), bill payments (FPX), inter-bank transfers (IBG), and the nationwide shared ATM network, PayNet serves a digital-savvy population exceeding 33 million individuals. Anticipating an increase in transaction volumes, PayNet recognized the necessity for a campus network upgrade to improve in-office digital experiences for its 500+ staff at the modern headquarters, especially in light of the shift towards a hybrid work model. Juniper’s campus network solutions were identified as the ideal fit, offering a future-proof and automation-rich solution with AIOps, ensuring performance, consistency, ease of management, and seamless scalability to accommodate growth. Powered by the Juniper Mist Cloud, Juniper’s AP32 and AP43 provide Wi-Fi 6 accessibility via an EVPN-VXLAN topology, guaranteeing consistency, longevity, and scalability supported by EX3400 and EX4650 switches. The upgrades enabled PayNet to simplify connectivity, remove complicated command-line interfaces and on-premises setups, and seamlessly integrate various IoT devices, including CCTVs and smart TVs, into the new network. Furthermore, Wired and Wi-Fi Assurance services driven by Mist AI have automated and streamlined network operations for PayNet’s engineers. The Marvis Juniper Network Assistant aids in identifying root causes of issues, providing proactive insights and prescriptive actions—an invaluable asset as they operate from a remote command center. Since implementing Juniper’s upgrades, PayNet has observed a significant reduction in connectivity-related tickets, enhancing user experiences across the network. As PayNet prepares for local and regional expansion, they eagerly anticipate further integration with Juniper’s Mist AI solutions. The strategic network refresh by Juniper has enabled PayNet to enhance the on-campus experience for employees and guests, positioning PayNet for future growth in both local and regional payment infrastructures. Preman Padmanabhan, Head of Networks, PayNet: “Our partnership with Juniper Networks has provided the networking foundations to allow us to focus on delivering our range of services without worrying about the backend.” Latest News website for Camera, AI, CIO, Cloud, Devices, Digital, Gaming, Network, Software, and Security. © 2024 Kizhakedath Media Services.
