 CLEMSON – The Clemson edge rushers are a group that’s split very oddly with ages, and it presents questions about the position’s future. At the top, it’s graduate seniors Xavier Thomas and Justin Mascoll. This season, the Tigers were fortunate to hit on freshman T.J. Parker, who leads the team in sacks with four. Besides him, Cade Denhoff is another younger player in the depth chart but it’s not a deep room for production. Where the difference lies is there’s a lot of talent still developing. Those players have to pan out, because Clemson will be losing their starters after 2023. Who’s gone Xavier Thomas (graduate) Justin Mascoll (graduate) Who’s likely returning T.J. Parker (freshman Cade Denhoff (redshirt sophomore) A.J. Hoffler (freshman) Vic Burley (freshman) David Ojiegbe (freshman) 2024 recruiting class Four-star Darien Mayo (commit) Three-star Adam Kissayi (commit) 2025 recruiting class Four-star Bryce Davis (offered) Four-star Ari Watford (offered Four-star London Merritt (offered) As we pivot to the coming seasons, it’s all underclassmen that will take over the position. While Parker is the spearhead, the return of Vic Burley looms large after his freshman season was delayed by injury. David Ojiegbe is another player to keep an eye on for 2024 and looking at the recruiting classes, the Tigers made a conscious effort to add on the edge. Adam Kissayi was a late addition to the class, and his size at 6-foot-7 makes him an interesting prospect. It’ll be impossible to instantly replace what Thomas and Mascoll bring to Clemson, but the Tigers are young and that’s a reason for optimism on the edge. 2023 season, Clemson Tigers football, defensive end, Looking Ahead, Football
