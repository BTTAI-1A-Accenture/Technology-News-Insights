Android Headlines / Smartphone Carriers News / Delta announces free Wi-Fi for all SkyMiles members At CES 2023, Delta and T-Mobile announced that all members of Delta’s SkyMiles program will have access to free in-flight Wi-Fi on Delta flights starting February 1st. This service, which was previously only available to T-Mobile subscribers, will now be available to all passengers, regardless of their mobile carrier. Initially, the service will be available on “most” of Delta’s mainline domestic flights, with plans to expand to international and regional routes in 2024. Delta CEO Ed Bastian stated that the company’s goal is to offer passengers an experience at 30,000 feet that is similar to what they have available on the ground. Therefore, to ensure that the free Wi-Fi service can handle the expected increase in demand, Delta worked with Viasat. Additionally, Paramount+ will also be partnering with Delta to offer their streaming service for free on Delta flights, adding to the in-flight entertainment options. T-Mobile SVP, Kevin McLaughlin, confirmed that there will be “no session limits” and the free Wi-Fi will be available on as many devices as the passenger has with them, not just a single phone or laptop. To use the service, passengers will need to be members of Delta’s SkyMiles program, but they can even sign up for an account while on the flight. “We didn’t just want free Wi-Fi to offer base-level service — we wanted it to be transformative for the entire onboard experience,” said Bastian. “It is imperative all customers onboard can enjoy their favourite content just as they would at home, and we’ve put this system through meticulous tests to make that possible.” In addition to the free Wi-Fi, Delta is launching Delta Sync, a unified brand for its software, connectivity, and in-flight entertainment offerings. It will include a personalized seatback entertainment system that is similar to a smart TV, food and beverage ordering in first class, a journey planner, content recommendations, and real-time notifications. Delta will roll some of the initial features of Delta Sync out by the end of the year, with more personalization features to come. “Delta Sync elevates what it means to be a Delta SkyMiles Member by enabling a journey that fits you perfectly and grows more rewarding the more you travel,” said Bastian. “The future of travel is one where your digital and physical experiences come together in a seamless, warm and personal way, making those human travel connections even more meaningful.” Copyright ©2023 Android Headlines.
