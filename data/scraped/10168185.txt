Here are spots to see California wildflowers this spring.  Do you want to find California wildflowers near you or hope to visit a superbloom site?  Our partners with the Hearst Newspapers DevHub team have put together a map of more than 25,000 wildflower sightings across the state. Learn more about the map here. (Video above: People flock to see superbloom in Southern California.)  The map is based on data from the social networking site iNaturalist and charts where the wildflowers were sighted by common superbloom flower types: California poppy, lupines, fiddlenecks, blue dicks, Western blue-eyed grass and more. There are plenty of wildflowers to see in our coverage area of Northern California, including the North Table Mountain Ecological Reserve north of Oroville in Butte County. But the biggest superblooms have been in Southern California and parts of the Bay Area and Central Coast.
