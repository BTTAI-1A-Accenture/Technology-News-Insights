The city of Salinas is making more progress toward sustainable energy by adding zero-emission vehicles to its fleet. The medium-duty vehicles include one flatbed truck and two cargo trucks. All trucks were originally gas-powered, but were converted to fully electric by Phoenix Motorcars.  The trucks supplied to Salinas were funded in part by the Monterey Bay Air Resources District Clean Air Management program and the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project program. "We're proud to be a recipient of this grant from the Monterey Bay Air Resources District," said Salinas City Councilman Steve McShane. “I think what we're going to see is a lot more electrification of our fleet for the benefit of saving money and being a good steward of the environment." Salinas Mayor Kimbley Craig is also committed to adding more green energy to the city. “Agriculture is the foundation of our local economy, so the air quality and climate in our community matter,” said Craig. “Replacing three large fleet vehicles helps protect our environment and also significantly reduces operational and maintenance costs."The new electric trucks will reduce atmospheric emissions by approximately 61 tons, maintenance costs by 75% and fuel costs by 80% annually. As for performance, the trucks offer a driving range of up to 110 miles, with the ability to be fully charged within two to three hours with a 50-kW Level III charger.
