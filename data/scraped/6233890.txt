(CNN) - If you run out of candy for trick-or-treaters this Halloween, M&M’s has you covered with a new promotion. It’s called Halloween Rescue Squad, a service that promises to deliver free Mars candy to your neighborhood in under an hour if you think you might run out. That’s right, M&M’s will come to the rescue if you’re low. M&M’s parent company Mars is teaming up with the delivery service Gopuff to facilitate the one-day operation on Oct. 31. Starting at 3 p.m. Eastern, you can hit up the Halloween Rescue Squad website for candy reinforcements if you’re running low. A backup supply of candy should be there within an hour, while supplies last. Important note: You must live in a Gopuff delivery area — more than 500 cities across the U.S. and counting — to be eligible for the offer. Copyright 2023 CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.
