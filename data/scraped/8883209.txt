 NATIONAL Lottery players have been urged to check their tickets after one lucky winner bagged more than £1million - but hasn't come forward for three weeks. The victor matched all six balls in the April 29th Lotto draw. The winning ticket was purchased in West Yorkshire - with the jaw dropping winnings amounting to £1,054,214.      But three weeks on, the prize is yet to be claimed - and will only be kept aside until the end of October. If not, the money will be donated to charities across the UK. The winning numbers were 12, 31, 35, 41, 44 and 56. The all-important bonus ball was 59. There are currently four £1 million prizes that have not been claimed - and the ticket holders don't have long to cash in their life-changing prize.  It comes after one lucky punter bagged himself an eye-watering £8 million jackpot after buying his first ever lotto ticket. Elsewhere, one man was so glued to the TV that he didn't realise he had just scooped a powerball lottery win of £5million. The newly-crowned millionaire was so taken aback that he kept the news a secret from his wife and kids. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.
