The Miami Heat‘s football counterparts are the Miami Dolphins. But while they may be connected in terms of location, they may not compare in terms of team structure and play style. In fact, the Heat may have more similarities with the Pittsburgh Steelers than the Dolphins. The Dolphins are an offensively explosive team, while the Heat ranked near the bottom in the league in several categories on offense. This is similar to Pittsburgh, whose inefficient offense is frowned upon by fans nearly every week. Both are teams that despite their arguably boring styles of play, ultimately end up sustaining success. The Heat were the No. 8 seed last season but ended up going all the way to the NBA Finals. The Steelers, despite their lowly offensive rankings, have still never had a losing season under head coach Mike Tomlin. There are always calls for improvements, but ultimately neither teams make significant changes because of the favorable results. Jayden Armant is a contributor to Inside the Heat.
