 After a year of teasing the League of Legends community, Riot Games has revealed the art and sustainability update for Runeterra’s favorite nine-tailed fox, Ahri. The swift-moving mage has been one of the most popular champions in the game and has gained even more traction since her gameplay changes at the start of 2022. The developers have spruced up Ahri’s look for the new year, giving her some flashy new animations, sound effects, voice lines, and splash arts. A majority of her skins have gotten small updates to their art, but a handful of splashes were completely reimagined by the art team to reflect a more modern take on an older skin line. Here are all of Ahri’s updated splash arts. You can try out Ahri’s ASU on League‘s PBE server now.
