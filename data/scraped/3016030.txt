                 Spectators enjoying the World Cup Final on Souled Out Kuala Lumpur’s giant screen as well as smaller screens scattered around the outlet. AFTER a month of cheers, tears and jeers, the Soccerfest 2022 campaign drew to a close in true inimitable Souled Out style. The Finale Street Party on Dec 18 drew a crowd of almost 2,000 football fans to its flagship outlet in Sri Hartamas in Kuala Lumpur. Since the late 1990s, Souled Out has always been the place for sports lovers to gather and cheer on their team. The atmosphere was electrifying with droves of fans geared up in their team’s jerseys arriving as early as 6pm to secure front row seats. They revelled in the atmosphere with plenty to eat, drink and loads of entertainment until the kick-off at 11pm. Emcee Ben Ibrahim kept the crowd entertained with trivia challenges, as did percussionist Calvin Clark and guest DJ Discfunktion. Elevating the mood even more was the cheerleading performance with acrobatic throws and precision manoeuvres, a specially customised Laser Mapping spectacle as well as moves and grooves from the So Gaya Dancers. Fans celebrate as Argentina takes the lead in the first half of the match. They went on to win the World Cup on penalties. The night ended on a high note where seven winners walked away with a cumulative prize worth RM10,000 in the Who Will Be Champion Contest. “The entire month was pretty challenging logistically. We had numerous areas for viewing – indoors, outdoors and we really had to put pedal to the metal to ensure returns were maximised especially for the 3am games even when there were only three to four tables,” said Soul Society Group executive director Mark Choo. “Personally, it was extremely heart-warming to feel and experience such a diverse crowd this past month. “One Korean friend told me that she felt like she was back home because she didn’t feel alone supporting South Korea at Souled Out. “And this example really epitomises and encapsulates our philosophy of family, inclusivity, diversity and speaks volumes of our mantra of being a home away from home for many expatriate customers,” he added. “We cannot wait for the next World Cup in four years time, but that’s going to be a challenge due to the time difference as it will be hosted in North America,” said Choo. Now Souled Out is preparing for the next festivities – Christmas and New Year. Joy To The World is the theme for Christmas Eve and the famous Brazilian Carnaval is the theme that will herald in 2023.
