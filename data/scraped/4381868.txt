Musician and rapper, Odumodu Blvck is under heat after he made a tweet yesterday, disclosing the title of his new song, “Mc Oluomo.” This song title did not sit well with many Nigerians, especially the Igbos on the X platform, who immediately criticised him.  It is worth noting that Mc Oluomo allegedly refused Igbos to vote at the recently concluded 2023 general elections. Following the backlash, he made a follow-up tweet calling those criticizing his song’s title “big fools” and labelled them “stupid”. The rapper has also warned Nigerians in the comment section who tried to make it about the tribe.   “WHEN I NO GO PERFORM FOR INAUGURATION YORUBA PEOPLE INSULT ME. WHEN I SING MC OLUOMO IGBO PEOPLE INSULT ME. WAHALA 😂😂#MCOLUOMO,” he wrote.  Netizens’ reactions below:  @oluwatofunmii_ said: The irony of an Igbo musician releasing a song titled…..MC Oluomo. Like there’s not a whole video where he’s threatening your people and warning ‘Mama Chukwudi not to come out to vote. Make it make sense please. @BestTokoniEver said: It’s not even about the message, it’s about the principle. most Nigerian artistes stand for nothing and I think him using MC Oluomo in a song is just sensationalizing/baiting. neither of them deserve to be platformed and in the coming days, we should prepare to be sick of it. @Heavy0Makain said: Why will anybody want to listen to a song that promotes MC OLUOMO. There is absolutely nothing worth emulating is that useless thug. @elrheymusic said: Lmao… You literally gave a speech about the MC Oluomo fighting spirit. 😂Next song go be “Adolf Hitler” but e no go be about Adolf Hitler, e go be about “strong leadership” 😂🙏🏾 @josephanyaa said: wetin be oluomo? christ in me the hope of glory abeg 😂😂😂 @191Introvert said: BABA BIG KALA NA AGBERO YOU WAN DY USE MOTIVATE US LIKE THIS?
