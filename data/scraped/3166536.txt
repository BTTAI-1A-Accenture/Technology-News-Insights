February 8, 2023 By Nik Roseveare The long much-anticipayed Hogwarts Legacy video game, set in the Harry Potter world, is offiically released on February 10th – but early access was granted on February 7th to those who pre-ordered the deluxe editon of the game, and it has already set a record on streaming platform Twitch. During the first day of early access, live streams of the game were watched by over 1.25 million Twitch users according to Twitchtracker, breaking the platform’s record of most live viewers for a single-player game. The record was previously held by Cyberpunk 2077 which attracked some 1.14 million simultaneous viewers in December 2020. Most Harry Potter fans tuned into the channel of xQc, a popular user, to follow his Hogwarts Legacy stream, which had in excess of 100,000 live viewers at peak times. Hogwarts Legacy comes a decade after the release of last Harry Potter book, but is set in the 1890s as players take on the role of a student starting at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the fifth year.
