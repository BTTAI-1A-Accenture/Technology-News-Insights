The UH Institute for Global Engagement leads UH’s efforts to educate, engage, and lead from a global perspective. The Institute promotes international collaborations, faculty and student exchange, research collaborations, learning abroad, global learning programs, and strategic partnerships to internationalize the campus and increase the global knowledge, skills, and engagement of the UH community. We strive to maximize opportunities for our students to learn globally – abroad and right here at home. We create and support opportunities for all types of global events, on campus, in Houston, and beyond. We link UH to the world, through targeted strategic partnerships and active participation in leading international education organizations.           In fall 2023, IGE proudly recognized the outstanding achievements of students who have seized opportunities to expand their horizons on the global stage, including Gilman Scholarship winners, Global Citizen Credential Graduates and International Education Scholarship Recipients.
