Sign In Register It's the start of another speed-filled week at the Whistler Sliding Centre (WSC)! Three of the community's youngest athletes, accompanied by WSC staff members, will be travelling to Korea at the end of this week to race in qualifiers for the Youth Olympic Games next year. Noah and Talia Melun will be gaining valuable experience as monobob pilots, while Payton Spence continues to build upon a promising skeleton career.  Passenger bobsled sessions will be offered Tuesday through Sunday, where members of the public experience speeds of up to 125 km/h and 4 g-forces of acceleration as they hurtle down a world-class track, driven by a trained pilot. I've had the opportunity to ride one for myself and it's unlike anything else you could experience.  Young resident luge athletes and their peers from Alberta Luge are training from Wednesday through Saturday. The BC Sliding Development Centre bobsleigh squad is also practicing their skills from Wednesday to Friday. On Sunday, Feb. 19 from 2 to 3 p.m., local skeleton racers will battle for medals at the BC Championships.  Later on Sunday at 7 p.m. check out the next BC Cup Luge race and cheer on the young athletes. Spectating is free for both races.
