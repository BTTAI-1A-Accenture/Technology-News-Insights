 Michael Harradence / April 5, 2023  According to a report on Insider-Gaming, Sony Interactive Entertainment is working on a brand new handheld platform and it’s not the previously-rumored cloud-streaming device. This new handheld is apparently the new hardware that Sony has been reportedly working on that is unrelated to the PS5 Pro. It’ll feature Remote Play with the PS5 and is currently going by the codename Q Lite, and requires a constant Internet connection. Furthermore, Insider-Gaming claims that the Q Lite will allow for adaptive streaming of up to 1080/60 FPS, and will apparently look like a PS5 controller and features an 8-inch LCD touchscreen. In addition, Sony’s new handheld will reportedly include adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, plus the usual handheld staples such as volume, speakers, audio input jack and such features.
