A casual Facebook post to telecommunications company Safaricom PLC landed a mother and her children a fully paid flight ticket from Kisumu to Nairobi during the festive period.  The lady identified as Carren Chepkorir reached out to the company through a Facebook post dated Sunday, December 11, requesting a reward for her loyalty to the telco giant over the past 15 years.  According to the post seen by Kenyans.co.ke, Carren narrated how she had exclusively used Safaricom services for over a decade, opting to use one card in an era when mobile phones come with dual sim slots.  “Since I have been faithful to you for the last 15 years( never had any other line), treat me to a plane flight experience from Kisumu to Nairobi and back with my 3 kids as I have never cheated on you,” she wittily stated in the Facebook post.  Responding to her post, Safaricom PLC thanked her for her loyalty and promised to act on her request.  “Dear Carren, thank you for staying with us. We will see what to do about it," the reply read. On Tuesday, December 27, Safaricom posted a screenshot of the Facebook post by Carren and a video of herself and her children preparing to catch a flight at the airport.  The post has since sparked reactions from other users who also sought rewards from Safaricom.  All this time, the company's main handle engaged the social media users to respond to the various concerns raised.  One user requested a review of his overdraft limit arguing that his transactions had surpassed Ksh1 million for more than two months.  "My request is to have my Fuliza limit increased, I  have made transactions of more than Ksh1 million in more than two months yet my limit is Ksh500," a user identified as Shednand Savage posted.  Also among the request sent were birthday gifts, while a couple of tweets commended Safaricom for its gesture to appreciate brand loyalty.
