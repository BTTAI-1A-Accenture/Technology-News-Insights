Information management technology (IMT) refers to the processes, systems, hardware, and software a company uses to conduct its day-to-day operations. Information management technology is also considered a professional discipline where a student learns to manage the selection, distribution, and organization of all the technology and related process in a business environment.
  The budget line encompassing all those systems and the costs of setting them up and maintaining them is referred to as information management technology. Information management technology is also referred to as information technology (IT), and information management and technology.
  Information management technology is a critical part of every business. It enables the big data type insights that drive business strategies, the precision underlying retail supply chain management, the records retention policy for compliance, and much more. There are very few business processes that do not depend or cannot benefit from information management technology.
  Since information comes in both tangible, physical forms as well as electronically—and therefore, intangibly—companies need a way to manage all their data. That's where information management technology comes into play. It gives companies a way to manage their data regardless of its form. To get the most out of IMT, companies must keep their business strategies in line with the technology that they put into place.
  IMT is commonly found in financial management, service management, as well as configuration management. But any company that relies on IMT must ensure its technology is safe and secure. Without taking the proper precautions, systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks by hackers. For example, organizations such as retailers must put safeguards in place so their customers' information such as names and credit card numbers aren't stolen.
  By centralizing the process and equipment, companies can function more efficiently, by allowing employees to concentrate on their own jobs without having the need to tend to data management. Although IMT does, it can lead to the redundancy and elimination of certain positions within the workforce. That's because some of the tasks that were once done by human labor may be replaced by computers and network systems.
  Information technology management usually falls under the responsibility of a company's Chief Information Officer or Chief Technology Officer. Employees in this department are responsible for ensuring that the company's data and computational resources are reliably accessible and secure from outside adversaries.
  IT management tasks include maintaining databases and cloud storage systems, system and network security, and providing technical support to other employees. They may also be responsible for securing customer data, and ensuring that the company's IT policies are in compliance with local or national laws.
  Information management technology is, as mentioned above, a discipline as well as a corporate function. It is often housed under a science program, but it can be part of a disciplinary specialty like a bachelor of health administration with a major in information management technology. Generally speaking, these programs cover:
  There are also many specialties within information management and technology when it is considered as a career. Data scientists, for example, work with different data sources and sets to create insights, metrics, and key performance indicators.
  Information management technology is often considered to be a driver of organizational efficiency as technology has traditionally helped workers to be more productive with it than without it. As the applications of technology in business have multiplied, information management technology has been further segmented into more meaningful categories that capture the function of the technology being used. This includes the enterprise-class IMT like enterprise resource management, enterprise relationship management, and enterprise records management.
  Any one of these sub-categories refers to a functional system that depends on hardware—computers, terminals, sensors, etc.—processes such as training, auditing, enforcement, and software. A large corporation will be running many of these systems, some of which will be purchased and some which are proprietary.
 Workers in information management technology are considered part of the highly skilled workforce and are sometimes referred to as knowledge workers.  Computer network architects handle the creation and maintenance of a business's network, including administering remote access. Computer hardware engineers design hardware and configure machines in ways that optimize them for their specific function.
 In addition to the typical IT skillset, a career in ITM requires strong interpersonal skills, management ability, and collaborative problem-solving skills.  There are several paths to a career in information management technology, most of which require technical or computer skills. The following are common roles at major technology firms.
  At the most entry level, developers occupy one of the most common roles in information technology, creating the applications and services used by a company's employees or consumers. They may also be responsible for designing a company's website, or securing customer data to prevent leaks. Most software developers must be proficient in one or more programming languages.
  Larger companies are also likely to employ specialized administrators and analysts to maintain their data and network security. Database administrators use specialized software to store and organize data, with redundant backups to prevent accidental loss. Systems analysts are responsible for finding bottlenecks and weak points in a company's processing systems, and enhancing compatibility so that information can easily be shared.
  Information security analysts occupy one of the most important roles in a modern enterprise–protecting the data of a company and its customers. They do this by probing computer systems for potential weaknesses and investigating any possible breach. They are also responsible for establishing safeguards and ensuring that the company's policies are in compliance with local laws.
  It is important to understand the distinction between information systems and the more commonly-used expression of information technology. Information technology refers to the machines and algorithms used to organize and process data, including computers, data storage, or cloud systems.
  Information systems is an umbrella term referring to any means of organizing and sharing information. Although this umbrella includes information technology, it can also include less sophisticated systems, such as card catalogs or paper filing systems. While modern-day information systems are largely computer-driven, IS specialists are largely oriented towards reaching a company's business goals, whereas IT specialists are more focused on maintaining software and hardware systems.
 In addition to the normal toolset of an IT specialist, an IT manager requires strong problem-solving and interpersonal skills. Modern IT systems require coordination among a team of specialists, so the IT manager will have to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their team, as well as resolve interpersonal conflicts and set attainable goals. There are several important qualifications that can help develop a career in IT Management. A certified associate of project management (CAPM) certification provides useful skills in project management, while an IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) certification provides the necessary know-how for running information processing systems. Information technology skills can be very difficult to learn, unless you are already very skilled with computers. IT requires strong analytical and problem-solving skills, as well as abilities in logic and mathematical reasoning. It also requires strong determination and time management, since many IT problems require long hours and deep focus in order to solve.
