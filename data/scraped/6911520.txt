 A kite surfer inadvertently sparked a search on Saturday after he was seen going out to sea and not coming back. According to an incident report, RCC Bermuda and police were contacted by a member of the public at Clearwater Beach in St David’s. “The caller was concerned for a kite surfer who he watched go out to sea and has not yet seen him return,” the incident report said. “The kite surfer had left his bike next to the beach and police COMOPS were trying to find the contact details for the bike owner from the licence plate. “A police land unit was dispatched to investigate further with the reporting source. Unfortunately, the telephone numbers found from the bike registration were not up to date and a police land unit was sent to the owner’s address.” RCC Bermuda reached out to contacts involved with kite surfing in Bermuda and managed to find the telephone number of the bike owner and called him, confirming that he was safe and on land. “He had travelled from Clearwater Beach to Grotto Bay by kite surfing and walked home from Grotto Bay,” the report said. “He intended to collect the bike the following day. “RCC Bermuda requested that if the surfer was not intending to return to the same beach he left from, it would be good practice to telephone RCC Bermuda and file a float plan before leaving.” You must be Registered or Signed in to post comment or to vote.
