Living near the Jersy Shore means a few things; the beach is right in our backyard, there are so many great restaurants to check out, and there's always something to do. Even if you do have to fight some crazy traffic for a few months out of the year, it's totally worth it. I'm coming up on my first full year, and am still so excited to call Ocean County home, and am really looking forward to everything another summer has to offer. There are a ton of free events that happen throughout the summer around the Shore. Like movies on the Bay in Lavallette. Or Seaside Heights' free concerts on the beach series that starts in July. Or movies on the beach in Point Pleasant, there really is a lot to do! As much as we all love summer, there are a ton of cool events that have been announced just after summer that are pretty exciting. Not that I want to rush summer, but details about this year's Italian Festival and Columbus Day Parade in Seaside Heights were announced, and I'm already counting down the days. The three-day festival was an absolute blast last year, and this year should be just as fun! This year, According to Exit 82,Â  Italian Fest will take place between October 6th and October 8th and is going to take over Grant Street in Seaside Heights. Friday the festival is from 4:00 pm to 10:00 pm, and on Saturday and Sunday, it starts at 10:00 am. Like in years past the festival will feature a wide variety of vendors, musical acts, and food. You've got to have food! You can follow the 32nd Annual Italian Festival and Columbus Day Parade on Facebook. In the meantime, here are all the fun fairs happening this summer around New Jersey!
