Login Follow ENTITIES backed by Singapore’s Temasek and Chinese investment firm HighLight Capital agreed to a deal worth 1.06 billion yuan (S$199.4 million) for stakes in a unit of Viva Biotech Holdings, the pharmaceutical service company said late on Sunday (Jun 11). The deal, which will dilute Viva Biotech’s stake in Viva Shanghai to about 75.79 per cent from 100 per cent, comes as the Chinese drug discovery and manufacturing service provider plans to restructure its businesses and list the Shanghai firm on an onshore stock exchange. Viva Biotech said it will use the proceeds to redeem convertible bonds, which will help it to “settle its outstanding liabilities without occupying its internal resources”. The deal included capital injection into Viva Shanghai by new investors and sale of existing interest in the Shanghai firm, the filing showed. Daxue Investments, Temasek Holdings’ indirect unit, and True Light P, held by Temasek-owned True Light Capital GP, will altogether hold 17.55 per cent stake in Viva Shanghai after the deal, according to the filing. HLC SPV and Qingdao Hongyi, both linked to HighLight Capital, will obtain a total of 6.66 per cent stake from the transaction. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox.
