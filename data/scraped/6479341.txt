Cumberland County's struggles with water contamination from toxic chemicals will be part of a WRAL documentary airing Wednesday that features the work of a geo-environmental student from Gray's Creek.  In the documentary, "Forever Chemicals: North Carolina's Toxic Tap Water," which airs at 7:30 p.m., UNC Pembroke student Ashley Cashwell Barez will discuss her years-long research on the impact of major storms on groundwater quality and quantity in southeastern North Carolina, specifically along the Cape Fear River basin “Since the fall of 2022, I’ve been monitoring long-term groundwater levels in the Black Creek aquifer,” Barez said in a news release from UNC-Pembroke.  The documentary details the nearly 7,000 residential wells in Cumberland, Robeson and Sampson counties that have been found to contain GenX and other man-made chemical compounds called PFAS, or per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, the release said. It was revealed publicly in 2017 that the Fayetteville chemical plant Chemours had been dumping PFAS into the Cape Fear River for decades.   Barez has been conducting the research alongside geology professor Dr. Madan Maharjan, according to the release. Together they've monitored two wells — dug 150 meters and 50 meters –– from the Cape Fear River while studying the aquifer's groundwater and the river's surface water.  “We are collecting (water) samples and comparing the GenX samples that we find and examining the extent of groundwater and surface water interactions at different stream stages,” Barez said.  Barez said in the release she hopes her studies will lead to policy changes regarding groundwater usage.
