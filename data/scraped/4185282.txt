By Nicky Carter - Reporter • 12 Aug 2023 THE ongoing battle to stop the spread of an invasive plant introduced to the UK by the Victorians saw a group of volunteers head to the riverside in Barnard Castle. Members of the town’s volunteer workers group removed Himalayan balsam as part of their ongoing activities. Volunteer Geoff King said that although the situation wasn’t too bad at the moment, it needed to be kept under control. “Like many invasive species, it was brought over by the Victorians. Unlike giant hogweed, Himalayan balsam is benign and edible.

 “You never get to the end of it. We did get on top of it about four or five years ago, but you only have to leave a few seeds lying about and it grows again.” He added: “This year is the first time for a long while we have been out.” In previous years, organisations such as the Tees Rivers Trust, the Heart of Teesdale Landscape Partnership and Groundworks have organised Himalayan balsam “bashing” activities, but now it has been taken on by the volunteer workers. “It would be really useful to come out every couple of weeks in the summer to tackle it,” added Mr King.
