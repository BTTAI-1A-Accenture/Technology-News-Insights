College Baseball Foundation LUBBOCK, Texas – The College Baseball Foundation is proud to announce its fourth annual All-American team. Thanks to the growth and success of the CBF’s three staple awards – the National Pitcher of the Year Award, the Brooks Wallace Award recognizing the top shortstop in the game and the John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year Award – the CBF is once again honoring the top players from 2023 with its All-American team. These players brought great success and attention to themselves and their teams and have proven to be outstanding ambassadors for the college game. Leading the way for this year’s team is national player of the year winner and 2023 National Pitcher of the Year winner Paul Skenes of LSU who also captured the 2022 John Olerud Two-Way Player of the Year honor. The team also features Brooks Wallace Award winner Matt Shaw from Maryland and Olerud Award winner Caden Grice from Clemson. Those three, along with West Virginia second baseman JJ Wetherholt, LSU outfielder Dylan Crews, Florida outfielder Wyatt Langford, Oral Roberts outfielder Jonah Cox and Wake Forest pitcher Rhett Lowder, were all unanimous selections. The players were chosen from voting done by the Foundation’s award committees.
