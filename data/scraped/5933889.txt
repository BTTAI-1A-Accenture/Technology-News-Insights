                 IN conjunction with Ramadan, Coca-Cola Malaysia invites people to give back to the community, especially the less privileged. Coca-Cola, in collaboration with foodpanda Malaysia, has launched an initiative to donate meals to those in need in Kuala Lumpur. Coca-Cola frontline marketing director Rina Surya said in a press statement that helping those in need was especially significant during Ramadan. “We wish all Malaysians will participate in this initiative to support the underprivileged community,” she said. Until April 21, for every order placed through the foodpanda mobile app using the promo code “PANDA”, one meal will be donated, inclusive of Coca Cola Malaysia’s drinks. The meals will be donated through Pertiwi Soup Kitchen, an organisation in the Klang Valley that is known for providing food to the underprivileged people. Besides the campaign with foodpanda, Coca-Cola Malaysia has joined the Absolut Bazaar X Festival Gaya Raya 2023 as an exclusive beverage partner. “All the activities done during this month are in line with our ‘Real Magic’ brand philosophy, which holds that magic exists everywhere,” said Rina. “Especially during the Ramadan month, we feel fortunate to be able to contribute and be part of the community,” she added. More than 500 local business owners will be present at the festival, presenting a variety of deals for the upcoming Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebration. The festival will be held at Malaysian International Trade and Exhibition Centre (Mitec) from April 14 to 17.
