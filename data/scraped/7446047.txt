 In 2014 Bill Gates said we have to put a lot of money into miracle energy technologies. Today we all know that “we don’t, because we already have the innovations that we need”. The assessment comes from Stanford University Climatologist Mark Jacobson, who has just published the book “No miracle needed – How today’s technology can save our climate and clean our air”, released by Cambrigde University Press. In the book, Prof. Mark Jacobson, co-founder of the 100% Clean, Renewable Energy Movement - claims that our planet already has 95 per cent of the necessary technologies and can quickly transition to 100 per cent renewable energy from sources such as wind, water, and solar without needing any "miracles". The challenge is to accelerate the deploying available technologies as fast as possible. And the answer is, says Jacobson, energy storage. He believes that energy storage, managing grid demand and connecting renewable sources over larger areas will provide a solution for the continuous supply of renewable energy. Storage technologies currently available include batteries, pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed air, or raising and lowering heavy weights. Whilst Jacobson states that batteries will be the main contributor to enable the energy transition, a new cluster known as Long Duraion Energy Storage (LDES) is emerging and can compete for cost and performance efficiency, greater grid stability and lower prices in energy bills. MTES - Magaldi Green Thermal Energy Storage - the first worldwide patented sand-based energy storage - is part of the innovative LDES cluster and plays a key role in the road towards climate neutrality and industrial decarbonization with energy security and energy independence conditions.
