Because the upward movement was taking place at the end of expiry, one could not rule out the element of short covering. If one looks a bit deeper in the trend in IT stocks, two things have become clear. That while the news and opinion has been negative, the price action has not been so bad as has been painted. Now let's look at what happened in the IT sector and why there could be a case for contrarian buying. Yes, the sector has some headwinds which not many had thought would appear two years back. But the bigger question is whether this phase of underperformance is about to get over or not. It might be time to shed the bias of negativity around large IT players.

It is not only that nifty it has been changing color in every second day, In the last two days FMCG stocks have seen a strong price action and a couple of up-grades have also come. There is literally a 360 degree change in the narrative about the sector and its fortune that was being heard . What happens in reality will be known later but this just highlights two things. First a business which has survived for long, there are phases where they are ignored by the street and then make sudden come back, just due to reason that they have size. Second, never write off a good balance sheet. Now the same thing applies to the IT sector, they have been ignored by the street for a good reason, lower growth and business challenges which AI is bringing to table. But the fact is that they also have strong balance sheets and the fact that they cater to demand where the market size is big and is global in nature and have a track record of adapting well to changes.

Four questions need to be asked; first, what is a defensive stock? Second, is a stock which was considered a defensive in 1994 when the Indian economy was just opening, still a defensive stock in 2024 ? Third, should there be a new definition of defensive stock in 2024 ? Last but not the least, what are the new defensive sectors or stocks? Please find the attached Newspaper publication.
