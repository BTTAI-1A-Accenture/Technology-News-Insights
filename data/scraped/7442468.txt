We view Accenture as a resilient, high-quality business with consistent earnings and cash flow, a strong balance sheet and very attractive returns on capital. Secular drivers like cloud migration and digital transformation, as well as new, innovative technology deployments like data security, block chain, AI and machine learning position Accenture well for continued growth.

The key drivers of improved growth come from the company’s Software-as-a-Service applications and the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle’s software applications power the Enterprise Resource Planning and Human Capital Management functions of large and small-to-medium sized businesses and are growing in the mid-teens. OCI is a differentiated cloud infrastructure provider that is gaining share due to its strong value proposition in speed, performance, and security. In addition, we believe that the company’s operating margins will improve from scale benefits in OCI and cost efficiencies from its recent acquisition of Cerner.” Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 Cisco Systems, Inc.

Polen Global Growth Strategy made the following comment about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2023 investor letter: “We raised our position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). During 2022, Amazon’s business experienced revenue deceleration from pre-pandemic levels combined with higher expenses resulting from inflation pressures as well as costs in their fulfillment segment. The fulfillment costs were set in motion during the pandemic when demand overwhelmed their network. More recently, AWS – along with Azure and GCP – experienced a deceleration in growth as customers globally feel pressure to optimize their usage in this tough macroeconomic environment. We don’t expect this deceleration to persist for the long-term given the secular trend of companies transitioning to the cloud. For long-term investors, we believe this combination provides an opportunity and that Amazon is now poised to re-accelerate revenue growth, of which we are already seeing signs, while expanding margins and free cash flow. With respect to margins, given the fast growth in AWS and advertising, the latter generating almost $40 Billion in sales and growing at greater than 30% recently, the resulting mix-shift could result in operating margins of 10% or higher over time. This level would represent a 5x increase over 2022 levels. In sum, we are capitalizing on what we believe is arguably one of the most competitively advantaged business in the world, which is growing well, poised to accelerate that growth and expand margins, and is trading at an attractive price.” You can also take a peek at 10 Most Profitable Small Businesses in 2023 and 10 Best April Dividend Stocks To Buy.
