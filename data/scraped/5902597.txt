 Motive packs so many features into its fleet management software that it’s essentially an all-in-one monitoring, tracking and compliance system. The automated compliance via an electronic logging device (ELD) makes it easy to ensure your fleet is up to date for inspection reports and hours of service (HOS) records. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, likes Motive’s camera system: “Motive is known for their in-cab camera systems. Adding vehicle tracking to the lineup offers you more visibility into your fleet and operations management and easily exonerates or validates complaints and violations.” To start, installing a vehicle gateway is easy with the Motive Fleet app. I didn’t do it personally, but Motive’s demo shows that it’s as easy as scanning codes on the device and your vehicle’s VIN. I found the safety features promising because it uses a dashcam to determine whether a driver is distracted, speeding or generally operating a vehicle in an unsafe manner. However, there are lots of reports from users that the technology isn’t always right and a driver was not speeding or hard braking. One of the ways Motive uses AI to help reduce your work is through its Smart Load Board. This feature takes the guesswork out of pairing drivers with specific loads. It automatically assigns work to drivers based on safety scores and hours available. I also liked how easy it is to maintain records for maintenance and the alerts that signal when it’s time for oil changes, inspections or axle greasing. Using Motive’s app to track fleet health is easy due to its automation and simple forms to fill out. I was able to track tire pressure, overall mileage and coolant temperature. I reached out to Motive to confirm its starting pricing and I got a call from a representative only minutes after filling out a contact form on the website. The person I spoke to confirmed that the cost would be approximately $150 per ELD, plus $25 per vehicle per month. However, this same person also refused to transfer me to a representative who could confirm pricing information. There is a landing page that offers free hardware from Motive, but dashcams are not included in the deal. Before Motive rebranded, dashcams cost $15 per vehicle per month. To get an actual quote, you need to provide information about your business and fleet and speak with a sales representative. See MoreSee Less I wasn’t able to test Motive’s support, but I did speak with a “front desk” representative who refused to transfer me to anyone else for information. According to many user reviews, support isn’t always helpful. In older reviews, customers were happy with how quickly the company replaced hardware that wasn’t working (back when Motive was known as KeepTruckin), but now customers say it’s difficult to get support to replace equipment. There were also reviews about Motive taking more money than agreed upon in contracts. Motive is an all-inclusive fleet management solution with options for hardware and software, making it a great choice for any company with any size fleet to track vehicles and assets.

 Azuga is one of the best fleet management software choices because it offers an almost fully inclusive system for tracking and monitoring drivers and fleets with an easy-to-use platform. It’s also an affordable option for smaller fleets, with a starting price of $25 per vehicle per month. To get the best set of features, you may want to opt for Azuga CompleteFleet, the highest plan Azuga offers. I used the mobile app and sat through a demo of the hardware and platform; all of it was intuitive to use. While not all drivers are fans of the GPS tracking features because it can feel like a violation of privacy (many of the app reviews are negative), they’re incredibly helpful as a fleet manager or owner. You can see where a driver is on a map and speed. The alerts are useful if there’s ever a safety incident, though I’d say the tracker’s sensitivity seems a bit high. Multiple reports from users say speeding and hard braking aren’t always happening when the tracker claims. The refresh on location is about 30 seconds, which is sufficient if it’s working, but some customers say it lags at times. I didn’t test the tracker, but the software itself can be slow sometimes when searching for a vehicle. I like that Azuga includes a fuel card integration, which is common for most fleet management software. And there’s a feature for locating the cheapest gas station near a driver (much like Google Maps offers), so that helps with fuel savings. My favorite features are the unique ones: driver rewards and fleet sustainability. The driver rewards program lets you reward your safest drivers whenever you want. It’s a nice incentive that motivates drivers to operate vehicles safely and it can help with retention. Azuga offers an emissions offset program that can net you a carbon-neutral certification. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, also likes the app and driver rewards system: “Azuga has a full line of products for managing your fleet. I find the phone app useful to communicate between dispatch and driver. Make sure to demo how the routes are input into the system. The driver rewards are new to fleet management software, which makes implemetation of a tracking system fun for drivers.” Azuga offers plans that are average for the industry, with a range of $25 per vehicle per month to $35 per vehicle per month. All plans come with GPS trackers, but the dual-facing camera costs $29.99 per month each. For a fleet of 10 vehicles all equipped with cameras, you’re looking to spend about $550 to $650 per month. See MoreSee Less Azuga has a helpbot on its website, but using it won’t put you in contact with a live chat support agent. The bot did help direct me to an answer to one of my questions, so it’s useful. Support is available by phone or email. Customer support hours are 24/7. I called mid-morning on a Wednesday and had no problem getting a hold of someone right away. The agent was helpful and made sure I didn’t have any follow-up questions before ending the call. My experience with support is just one example. When I read some user reviews, I found that support gets a mixed bag of positive and negative feedback, though mostly positive. Some of the frustrations have more to do with billing, cancellation policies or slow-to-respond customer service. Azuga’s fleet management software is ideal for owners and drivers who want an easy-to-use platform and app with unique features, such as driver rewards. Learn more: Read our Azuga review.

 IntelliShift is comprehensive fleet management software primarily serving as a real-time fleet tracking system and driver safety management program. Through GPS devices and AI-assisted in-cab cameras, IntelliShift helps you locate where your vehicles are, what the health of those vehicles are and how your drivers are doing out on the road. One way IntelliShift is using AI positively is through its in-cab cameras. Drivers get voice notifications from the system if they’re following another vehicle too closely, if they’re distracted or if they’re drifting into another lane. Some users say that the sensors are a bit too sensitive, and they get unnecessary alerts about possible collision hazards, so it isn’t a perfect system. Though many of IntelliShift’s competitors offer self-installation options for equipment, IntelliShift offers a more hands-on approach to onboarding its new customers. You still have the option to install a GPS tracker yourself, though. I like that a representative comes to a client’s location to install the GPS trackers and cameras and walks through the platform to ensure everyone gets up to speed quickly. I wasn’t able to test the platform personally because no one would grant me access, but I was able to see the software and equipment in action. I find the platform intuitive with its drag-and-drop functionality and easy navigation. IntelliShift’s app for operators is easy to use, too. You can turn on or off driver status, access certifications, create driver logs and send inspection and HOS sheets. The GPS tracks more than location of your vehicles; it also tracks diagnostics, fuel, temperature, distance and speed. The only metric I couldn’t find was tire pressure. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, commented on the platform as well: “Intellshift’s reporting and dashboard look easy to navigate and review collected data. With the longer contract periods, make sure you fully understand how the system works and that it will meet your current and future needs.” I couldn’t get confirmation on pricing from IntelliShift. The company doesn’t disclose pricing because it only offers custom quotes, though I’m not sure why when there seems to be a base plan for most fleets. It does make clear that you need a minimum of 10 vehicles in your fleet and contracts are for 36 to 60 months. See MoreSee Less IntelliShift offers excellent customer support, according to many of its customers. I found countless user reviews praising the support from IntelliShift’s account managers and representatives. I wasn’t able to test customer service because you must have an account to access support. You can get in touch with support via email or phone. IntelliShift is a great pick for tracking, monitoring and managing your fleet and drivers, especially with its AI-powered driver coaching via the in-cab camera.

 GPS Insight (formerly Rhino Fleet Tracking) is primarily a GPS tracking system for your fleet and that’s what you should expect from the publicly available pricing. For more management of your drivers and vehicle diagnostics, you’ll have to upgrade to the ELD package, which costs more, but the pricing is undisclosed. Still, for location tracking services, GPS Insight is an affordable option and doesn’t require you to have a vehicle minimum. As I mentioned above, GPS Insight is a location-tracking service at its core. The platform integrates with Alexa, which makes for a nice shortcut when you’re dispatching a driver to a specific vehicle. The company offers short-term (read: monthly) contracts, which could be a relief for smaller businesses that aren’t ready to sign 36- or 60-month contracts. With accurate location tracking data, you can find inefficiencies in fuel consumption and confirm drivers’ timesheets. I found the mobile app easy to use for tracking vehicles and where they’ve been. The map option with all of your vehicles on one screen makes it easy to dispatch or even offer an ETA for customers. I didn’t get a chance to use the GPS Insight platform myself, but through demos I was able to get a good idea of how to use the features. I like how the vehicle maintenance feature works with a dynamic search feature in the filtering option. It’s easy to see which of your vehicles need, say, oil changes or air filters. The dashboard shows cost reports and overdue and current tickets. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, shared his thoughts on GPS Insight: “GPS Insight has a full tracking system. In addition, they offer work order management for the trades fleet with a signature capture—this provides not only a date stamp but also adds in the location.” As is the case with most per-vehicle pricing, GPS Insight offers a discount to companies with bigger fleets. The $21.95 per vehicle cost applies to those who need tracking service for at least 20 vehicles. There is no public pricing for smaller fleets, but unlike most other fleet management software, GPS Insight does not require long-term contracts, so it could still be a valuable choice for your company. It’s also worth noting that only the GPS tracker is included with the published price, not a dashcam. And, more importantly, the ELD package is required for the ELD logs and many of the features listed. It seems the published price is for tracking only. See MoreSee Less Both of my calls to sales and support were pleasant and helpful interactions. As soon as my call was routed, I was greeted quickly by representatives who were more than willing to answer my questions. In my experience, this is uncommon in the industry; other fleet management company representatives have been less than forthcoming about pricing or how their platforms work. I was able to get demos, some pricing information and help with configuring the software to track specific diagnostics. Businesses with smaller fleets (and budgets) should do well with GPS Insight thanks to no long-term contracts and a low starting price. Learn more: Read our GPS Insight review.

 There are a couple of reasons why AUTOsist stands out among competitors: It has a low learning curve and provides most of the tools you need to track and manage fleet maintenance at an affordable price. AUTOsist is one of the few fleet management companies that provides plans and transparent pricing for its software. To be clear though, AUTOsist is not a complete solution for companies that need to manage ELD compliance, but that’s really the only feature lacking. I tested the platform and found it instantly intuitive. It took a while to input all the vehicle data, but that’s to be expected. I like that there’s an option to add custom fields to the form (plus an option to apply the custom field to all assets you add). The same goes for adding services to vehicles. Halfway through the process, I found myself wishing for an import option. Turns out, there is a bulk import option (it’s in the right-hand menu). Reminders are an expected feature so you can easily manage services for your vehicles. Trip logs are also easy to use, with just a form to fill out (also with custom fields as an option). In fact, that’s how everything in AUTOsist works: via forms. It was all easy to do but a bit tedious because nothing was automated (at least, not in the entry-level plan). The biggest benefit of using AUTOsist is to digitize your inventory and inspections and manage your fleet’s maintenance schedule. This is a great way to get you off pen-and-paper or Excel methods. The most I can say about GPS tracking and dash cams is that you’ll have automation here when it comes to work orders and reports on telematics and driver behavior. You can track all the telematics you’d expect, from fuel and tire pressure to temperature and mileage. I couldn’t immediately locate incident reports as an option, but I was informed that most users create these in the work order section. With that said, the company can create a custom option specifically for reports. There’s also an option to create categories for fleets and create role permissions to reduce what users see. For example, if you have multiple departments with separate fleets and specific people in charge of each department, you can prevent users from feeling overwhelmed with options by limiting what they see on their dashboards. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, shared his thoughts on the software: “AUTOsist provides a simple format for small fleets to get started tracking their maintenance and repair records and move away from paper or spreadsheets. AUTOsist mentions inventory management—make sure to inquire in a demo if this is a requirement for your operations.” It’s rare that I get to talk about actual pricing, so I give props to AUTOsist for being transparent about its plan pricing. The entry-level plan costs only $5 per asset or vehicle per month if you pay annually. If you want to add GPS tracking, it costs $27 per vehicle per month (billed annually), and this includes the hardware. For GPS tracking and an in-cab dash cam, you’ll pay $57 per vehicle per month (billed annually), and this includes the tracker and cam. There is a free option available for mobile app users who only need to track maintenance for a single vehicle. I’m probably going to continue using it myself because it’s better than that sticker they put on your windshield to remind you of your next oil change. You can get a 14-day free trial or demo and it only requires your contact information. Maintenance: $5 (annually) / $6 (month-to-month)Maintenance + GPS: $27 (annually) / $30 (month-to-month)Maintenance + GPS + Cams: $54 (annually) / $60 (month-to-month)  See MoreSee Less Support is available by phone, email and live chat. The team tries to answer every call or message on a 24/7 basis, but it doesn’t always work out. You should get a call back soon, though. I tried live chat and didn’t get a live agent, but I got a call minutes later. The person I spoke with answered every question I had and confirmed that clients typically work with account managers directly for custom solutions. AUTOsist specializes in fleet maintenance management. It’s an ideal choice for small businesses that want to track maintenance, driver behavior and telematics in a simple, unfettered way.

 What I like most about Samsara is that it’s possible to build a custom fleet management and asset security solution and only pay for the features you need. I’m not sure Samsara is the best choice for businesses with smaller fleets because my research shows that you have to pay for a full year of service up front (and sign at least a three-year contract). Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, agrees that it may not be best for smaller fleets: “Samsara is for mid-size to larger fleets, with a full range of options to select for your operational needs. For fleets with reefer trailers, Samsara has a solution for tracking trailer locations and inside temperature.” It may be easier to list features that Samsara doesn’t offer (inventory management is the only one that comes to mind). That’s the beauty of Samsara though. There are so many options for your customized solution. Use GPS trackers and ELD devices to digitally maintain compliance, create driver safety scores and send roadside inspection reports. As technology has improved, so has Samsara’s devices and platform. Some dash cams come with built-in AI to watch for distracted driving and then notify drivers to turn their attention back to the road. Although I wasn’t able to test Samsara myself, I did go through multiple demos to better understand what using Samsara is like as an admin and driver. The platform’s dashboard has a clean interface that’s easy to navigate. The map has smooth movement and locating vehicles is easy. I’m also a fan of the built-in messaging feature, which saves time contacting drivers when dispatching or updating a job. I honestly couldn’t find a missing feature with the exception of inventory management, but Samsara offers an open API, so you would be able to connect your system. It’s worth mentioning that Samsara is a full solution, and you cannot bring your own devices; you have to use Samsara cameras and trackers. Also, Samsara stores an infinite amount of data in its cloud storage so you can access any of it at any time (at no additional cost). There’s no publicly available pricing for Samsara’s packages, but this is mostly because every plan is custom built for your needs. Midmarket to enterprise businesses are the focus for Samsara, but they do offer options for small businesses. It costs $1,500 up front for a three-year license for the vehicle gateway and hardware is sold separately. If you need ELD support, that is a separate cost. So, if your needs are minimal, Samsara can be an affordable option, but pricing adds up quickly as you tack on additional features. See MoreSee Less Despite my multiple attempts, I couldn’t get a hold of support at all. You have to be a customer and log in to contact any customer service representative. The sales rep I spoke with was friendly and helpful. At no point did she refuse to give me information or pressure me in any way. Users have mostly positive reviews regarding customer support, but there are a handful of customers who have had difficulty contacting support or feel that it was unhelpful. Samsara is a full-featured fleet management software, but it’s also customizable, so you can get only the tools and hardware you need. It is a little pricey, so it’s best suited for an enterprise-level company with large fleets. Learn more: Read our Samsara review. See MoreSee Less Starting Price  $25 per vehicle per month

 Linxup is one of the most versatile fleet management solutions available. You can purchase trackers for vehicles or assets, add on an ELD compliance solution and even track power take-off events with sensors. The base features of Linxup is GPS tracking of vehicles with its plug-in tracker. It refreshes every 60 seconds while a vehicle is running and every hour when the vehicle isn’t on. You can see where the vehicle is heading and the speed at which it is traveling. For more tracking and monitoring features, you’ll have to subscribe to the ELD solution, which costs extra. Like other fleet management software, the Linxup’s ELD logs helps facilitate inspection reports, monitors driver behavior and driver duty status and warns of potential violations. The Linxup platform is easy to use, though I find it a bit cluttered. I like that I’m able to send a message to any driver from the platform without having to find someone’s phone number. If you choose to have a dashcam, you can easily tap into any driver’s POV or see inside the cab. The map view is a great way to check in on the route vehicles are taking; I was able to see stops along a route with red arrows. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, mentioned Linxup’s non-vehicle tracking: “Linxup’s tracking for non-vehicle assets will appeal to construction and heavy equipment organizations. They offer rugged devices and solar-powered devices for stationary and non-stationary assets.” Linxup provides GPS tracking for fleets with basic features for $25 per vehicle per month. There’s also an option for asset tracking that starts at $15 per asset per month. The devices vary in price, depending on whether you choose a three- or two-year contract. Three-year contracts for service come with free GPS trackers for vehicles. The ELD solution from Linxup starts at $30 per vehicle per month, but that’s without GPS tracking. Add GPS tracking and the price bumps up to $40 per vehicle per month. For full IFTA compliance, you can track mileage for fuel-tax reporting at $50 per vehicle per month. See MoreSee Less Rather than detail my own experience with support (it was fine), it’s probably best to relay what I learned from several user reviews online. Many customers say the GPS trackers don’t work or break quickly. Linxup only offers support from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. CT on weekdays, but there are reports that it took days to hear back from support. On the flip side, there are many satisfied customers who say that support representatives have been helpful and they’ve had no issues. Linxup offers a versatile solution for you to track vehicles in a fleet, assets and PTO events, so you have tight security on your valuables. Additionally, there’s an affordable ELD solution for you to maintain compliance. Learn more: Read our Linxup review. See MoreSee Less Starting Price  Not disclosed

 It makes sense for a company like Verizon to jump into the fleet management software pool, given the need for GPS tracking. Verizon Connect offers nearly all the features you need to manage the health of your fleet, drivers’ behavior, estimated delivery of goods and necessary compliance. What’s best about Verizon Connect is that it scales easily for small to midsize businesses that need a platform and tools to support growth. My favorite feature of Verizon Connect is the platform itself. The browser-based app is designed with a clean interface, easy-to-read map and intuitive navigation. Icons that represent vehicles in motion, at rest or idling are easy to identify. Routing and dispatch tools are also well designed and make it simple to plan the best route for each driver. It works a bit like Google Maps in that it presents the optimal route for less traffic or faster speed limits to ensure deliveries make it on time. Geofencing is a common feature of the best fleet management software and Verizon Connect includes it. This feature lets you see assets or vehicles in a specific location that you set. You can create the boundaries you want to monitor, which lets you see the various stops a driver makes or if they drive outside of the parameters. Fleet maintenance scheduling is a big part of fleet management. Verizon Connect includes tools that let you record work or service orders, send reminders for the next needed service and send alerts to managers, mechanics and others responsible. As long as you keep records updated, you can view service history, cost reports and more. Aimee Gascon, Vice President of Blue Septic Tank Service, shared with us what she likes about using Verizon Connect at her company: “We chose Verizon Connect to streamline our operations, as it tracks mileage and fleet maintenance in one program. Switching from our previous GPS company to Reveal was seamless and easy to learn. I can monitor all our drivers from home, even during emergencies, without being in the office. The affordability and convenience of integrated video, along with having everything in sync under one program, were key reasons we went with Verizon Connect. Their dashcams are also more affordable for both forward-facing and driver-facing cameras.” Like many of Verizon Connect competitors, it doesn’t reveal pricing for its plans. After reading several reviews, I’ve found that you can expect a range of $20 to $40 per vehicle per month, but this is an estimate and every client is different, so you need to get a custom quote. There is a 36-month contract required and according to many users, the early termination fee is high (one user reported $3,000 to cancel). See MoreSee Less Despite seeming to offer every avenue of support possible (phone, email and live chat), Verizon Connect does not offer live chat support to existing customers. I was able to contact a sales representative, who was helpful in answering questions. Many user reviews show that customer support is subpar, at best. What I found most useful were the videos and articles in the knowledge base. Verizon Connect has excellent coverage across the United States and it offers two plans with most of the features you’d need for scaling your business. Learn more: Read our Verizon Connect review.

 Fleetio’s pricing is more affordable than most fleet management software and it includes automated features, time tracking for technicians and inventory management. I found several unique features that aren’t offered on the bigger names in fleet management. It seems that Fleetio goes beyond the basic features of a fleet maintenance or management app. Yes, you can track information about your fleet and drivers, create work orders and schedule servicing. But on top of these standard features, you can import information about your vehicles using a VIN lookup, track parts inventory, get low stock alerts and set up time tracking for technicians. These are features any company with in-house mechanics would need. I tested the software myself, and oh my goodness, do I love the VIN decoder. I simply entered a vehicle’s VIN, and the software automatically populated more than 50 fields. I doubt I need to express to you just how much of a time saving that is. I want to also note how easy it is to get started with Fleetio; the software includes a guided setup, so I didn’t have to figure out which step was next. Setting up a service reminder was simple. I chose the vehicle I wanted to schedule, chose one of literally hundreds of tasks and set the interval (oil and filter change every three months). Recalls show up automatically if a manufacturer has issued one and you can read the details in the vehicle record. Each vehicle record also has a report to show the cost of ownership, which helps you decide whether it’s time to retire an old clunker. There’s so much data Fleetio gathers that the dashboard can be a bit overwhelming at first. I found myself hiding many of the charts that weren’t relevant to me and it was easier to consume data that way. Also, you can customize the look of your dashboard; drag and drop one chart lower, higher, left or right to put the most important metrics front and center. I wasn’t able to test the GPS tracking or other telematics that Fleetio reports because I didn’t have the hardware or software to integrate. Fleetio doesn’t handle that side of things, so this software is more for those who want service and maintenance management for fleets. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, commented on some of the features he likes: “Fleetio is a full-featured fleet management information system (FMIS) for tracking asset lifecycles, costs, maintenance, inventory, repairs and performing data analysis. The system is easy to use and has great dashboard graphics. I liked the VIN decoding feature for adding details for new assets. They offer integrations for GPS tracking, in-cab cameras, fuel and more.” Fleetio is one of the more affordable options on the market. Pricing ranges from $4 per vehicle per month to $10 per vehicle per month, billed annually. Given that pricing, Fleetio is an incredible value. It isn’t the traditional fleet management software that includes hardware for tracking fuel, temperature or driver behavior, though. To get a complete solution, you’ll have to integrate other hardware and tools, which will inevitably end up costing more. Essential: $4 (annual) / $5 (month-to-month)Professional: $7 (annual)Premium: $10 (annual) See MoreSee Less It seems that Fleetio’s support options are by phone and email. You can call Fleetio’s team from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET weekdays. Otherwise, you can use a contact form on its website or through the platform. The window I opened looked like a live chat option, but it just emailed support. This was after hours, so I didn’t hear back from them until the following day. The representative who emailed me did so about 12 hours after I made first contact, so I’d call that responsive. Also, the answer was satisfactory (it was regarding how Fleetio works with third-party telematics and GPS providers). Businesses that need a nuts-and-bolts view of their fleet with the help of automated processes and integrated data sources would do well with Fleetio, especially if fleet maintenance is handled in house.

 Whip Around is affordable fleet management software that focuses on service alerts and document management. The result is an easy way to ensure your fleet stays healthy and your drivers can produce documents for compliance with DVIR and DOT. Jim Schmidt, our advisory board member and Assistant Director for the Enterprise Services Department with the City of Salem, shared the features he likes: “Whip Around focuses on tracking operational transactions like maintenance, fuel and repairs. They have integrations for GPS tracking and other needs. They have an app for daily vehicle inspections (DVIR) for drivers to report issues.” One of the best features of Whip Around is how it handles digital document management. Drivers can easily produce documents needed for inspections when on the road via the mobile app. You can also add photos for documentation, track mileage and fuel in the app and access reports anywhere. I’m also a fan of Whip Around’s service alerts and work orders because it’s an easy and automated process. With that said, Whip Around is missing a lot of features that are only possible to get through integrations. In fact, Whip Around integrates with many of its competitors that offer a lot of the same features Whip Around offers, so it seems redundant. I could see a business wanting to use Whip Around specifically for tracking service needs for vehicles and assets and documents for drivers. There are also helpful cost reports so you can see which vehicles are more expensive to maintain or drive based on service costs, fuel costs and mileage reports. By far, Whip Around is the most affordable options for fleet maintenance in the industry. There’s a free version that allows you to track fuel and defects, keep digital records for inspections and store documents for one vehicle. The Standard plan costs $5 per vehicle or asset per month (billed annually) and allows you to manage up to 250 assets. It offers complete features for inspections and reporting. Upgrading to the Pro plan costs $10 per vehicle per month (billed annually) and includes every feature of Whip Around. Basic: Free (one vehicle or asset)Standard: $5 (annual)Pro: $10 (annual) See MoreSee Less Although Whip Around offers live chat, I wasn’t able to connect with anyone when I tried messaging on the website. My expectation was for someone to be with me in less than three minutes (that’s what the chat window claimed). No one responded and I didn’t get an email. So, all I can tell you is that users who have left reviews claim support is typically responsive and helpful. In fact, most reviews are fairly positive for Whip Around’s support. Whip Around is best for businesses that need an easy way to access documentation, reports and service schedules at an affordable price. Learn more: Read our Whip Around review. See MoreSee Less 
 Fleet management is the management of commercial vehicles owned by an organization to improve productivity and cost-effectiveness without compromising on safety and customer satisfaction. Software can provide a single real-time dashboard to fleet managers to manage performance and maintenance, so that fleet operations run smoothly. Fleet management apps enable fleet managers to have a real-time view of vehicle movement and location, driver performance, fuel consumption and potential delays. Fleet management software can ensure: When shopping for the best software for managing your fleet, ensure that the option you choose has these core features: Driver management refers to monitoring and measuring essential driving parameters such as acceleration, harsh braking, speeding and over-idling. When you share feedback on them with the drivers, they can take corrective measures to help: When you invest in developing good driving habits, driver retention also increases. In addition to keeping your fleet up to snuff, it’s a good idea to choose software that also helps keep your drivers safe—and compliant with their hours of service (HOS). Getting goods where they need to go on time is important, but it’s also vital that drivers take mandatory rests after driving for long periods. HOS compliance ensures drivers take those breaks to help prevent accidents. Many fleet management apps track driver data, such as engine run time and driver speed. Your drivers should also be able to record the times they drive along with DVIRs, which contribute to your HOS compliance. If you aren’t tracking this data and ensuring drivers are taking breaks, you could be charged a fine or lose your license. Vehicle management may include a GPS vehicle tracking system and a fleet alarm system: Fleet operations management features include route planning and monitoring, fuel management and task management: Fleets do not operate in isolation. They must fully integrate with all other business activities. Your software should be capable of integrating seamlessly with other business tools such as CRM and inventory management. Other software integrations you should look for include: Fleet management can make it easier to manage inventory for you, be it parts needed for fleet maintenance or products being delivered. Mobile apps for drivers can be directly linked to inventory levels so that the status is updated as parts are used or products are delivered. In some cases, a platform can even file orders for you automatically once stock on certain items reaches a low enough level. Obviously, you want your fleet management tools to have real-time tracking, maintenance reminders and driver data, but there are other less talked-about needs, too. Keep these criteria in mind: Through two easy steps: complete the form and get matched with suppliers.  Ask an expert Amy Smith Staff Reviewer Jim Schmidt Forbes Advisor Advisory Board Member There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, so start by assessing your needs to figure out what’s most important to you. Some businesses just want to move from spreadsheets to a unified system for data and reports, while others may need to prioritize GPS tracking and an ELD system. An all-in-one solution is going to be more expensive, but you shouldn’t need to integrate too many other apps for your small business. Staff Reviewer Fleets of all sizes will find many valuable features with any of these systems. Know what your needs are before contacting for a demonstration. Ask for references in your area of operation and type of operation. Once you have selected one or two top candidates, ask for a pilot project to install devices on several vehicles to try for 30-60 days before committing to purchasing. For larger operations that bill internal departments or external customers, these systems may need enhanced integrations. Forbes Advisor Advisory Board Member For a complete fleet management solution, you have to consider everything that goes into the total cost. From GPS tracking hardware to licensing, it can get pricey even for a small fleet. The average cost of fleet management software has a wide range depending on your needs, whether you pay monthly or annually and how many assets you have in your fleet. Here’s a breakdown of average costs for a fleet of 10 vehicles: Forbes Advisor set out to determine the best fleet management software by comparing each company on a variety of factors, including cost, must-have features and value for the money. We scored each software on a five-star ranking system, with the highest score being five out of five stars. Here’s what we considered for each category in our ranking: AUTOsist, Fleetio and Azuga are Forbes Advisor picks for the best fleet management software for different reasons. AUTOsist is the best overall for its affordable plans and flexible features. Fleetio is excellent for process automation, saving you time on operations. Azuga is popular for easy tracking and a great mobile app. Typically, you’ll install hardware that includes GPS tracking on each of the vehicles in your fleet. It can track location, speed and routes, which can help you know where your vehicles are and give drivers direction on where they need to go. You should also look for fleet management software that lets you digitally track service history, registration of vehicles and maintenance needs. A fleet fuel card is essentially a gas credit card but meant for large fleets of vehicles. They usually deliver real-time reports with fuel costs, mileage and driver numbers. Finding the best fleet fuel card comes down to which one covers the region your fleet travels, among other features. Learn more about fleet fuel cards here. Any business that relies on cars, trucks, vans or other vehicles needs fleet management. The management of a fleet requires a business to track everything from maintenance and registration of each vehicle, location, fuel costs, parts―if they handle in-house maintenance―and management of the drivers of the vehicles. Fleet management is important because it helps in smooth fleet operations, irrespective of fleet size. Fleet management helps in route optimization, fuel cost optimization, lowering driver turnover, scheduling vehicle maintenance and otherwise helping businesses foster more efficient fleets. A solid fleet management system should have core features that allow you to manage your drivers, vehicles, operations and, if you have any, inventory. You want to look for a fleet management system that integrates with other business software tools including inventory management and CRMs. The vehicle management portion of the system should allow you to track your drivers and vehicles, such as through a GPS tracking system. It should also make operations management run smoother by helping you manage fuel and labor costs and provide proper trip planning for your drivers and customers. One of the best ways to improve fleet management is to implement software with process automation, fuel card integration and data collection to track driver behavior. All these features can reduce cost and prevent loss and accidents. To reduce costs, optimize your drivers’ routes, upgrade your vehicles’ equipment and install fleet tracking software and hardware. Keep an eye on fuel cards to find the best cost available.
