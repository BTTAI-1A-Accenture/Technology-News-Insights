The update said harvest has finished in Central Queensland, with many growers enjoying record yields in the biggest harvest they have seen in more than a decade. The focus is now on southern Queensland, with the majority of receivals coming from the Goondiwindi region. Northern New South Wales sites are well into harvest now, with the majority of receivals coming from Moree, Dubbo and Burren Junction regions. Canola deliveries have been strong, with the cool, wet spring bringing in good yields and oil levels. In southern NSW, harvest is now under way in all regions, thanks to improved weather conditions over the week. Sites are receiving predominantly canola, but wheat receivals are increasing as growers access drying fields. Victoria’s harvest is now building momentum, with growers harvesting canola and barley across most areas. Clear weather and rising temperatures for the next few weeks will allow for further progress across the state and should bring in more cereals. GrainCorp said it has continued to see the “full spectrum of grades”, including milling wheat and malting barley, delivered to its network, and its teams are actively assessing requirements for segregations as needed.
