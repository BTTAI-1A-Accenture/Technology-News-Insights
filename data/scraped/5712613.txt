Don't know your CC box number? Log on to Banner at coloradocollege.edu/ssb. Click on "Student." Click on "Addresses." Your CC box information will be listed under "Addresses and Phones." Do not use your student housing address. This will slow the processing and delivery of mail and packages. Delivery drivers are not allowed in secure buildings. If you (the student) are off campus for a year for any reason, your CC box will be reassigned to a new student. A new CC Box will be assigned upon return. Bring a photo ID during mailroom hours (M-F 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m.) to pick up any mail & packages. Mail Services urges caution when sending perishables (i.e., food) to students. If you do mail a perishable item, please notify the student that the item will be delivered to their CC Box address. Colorado College is not responsible for perishable items sent to students. There is no refrigeration in the mailroom. We can only keep perishable packages for one to two days before they must be thrown out. Most perishables cannot be held over the weekend. show all / hide all
