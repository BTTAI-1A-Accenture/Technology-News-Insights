 Can you tell me what motivates each member of your team? Can you immediately state who is most motivated by learning, by money, by building relationships? I'm not asking you to guess, I'm wondering when you last asked them. For the first three years proSapient, I am ashamed to say that I had no idea what motivated my team. We were an early-stage start-up and I was all consumed with growth at all costs. I'd foolishly assumed that my team had the same goals as I had! What a terrible assumption. If you want to be what Liz Wiseman calls a Multiplier, if you want to get the maximum performance out of your team you need to understand what drives them. This isn't a collective understanding but the drivers of each individual  Motivation Motivation comes in two forms. Intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. The latter is the most common and means that individuals are driven to gain a reward (a bonus) or to avoid punishment (a bad performance review). Intrinsic motivation is when you perform well for the sake of performing well or to achieve a goal that you yourself have set as opposed to another person. Sometimes they go together. Set big, punchy bonuses and some members of your team will push hard to achieve those bonuses. For those team members, while the bonus is an extrinsic goal, the ability to earn good money may also be an intrinsic motivator. For those who don't have money as an intrinsic motivator, the promise of a large bonus may not lead to the behavioural changes that a money-motivated individual may expect.  What drives your team? After my first three years at proSapient, I was determined to become a better manager. Each member of my team was at the company to achieve certain things, some of which aligned with my ambitions, others were totally unrelated. I felt that in order to be a good manager, I had to first understand what drove each member of my team and then make it my duty to ensure those ambitions were coming true, even if they didn't impact my own ambitions. I now run this exercise every 6 months: There is nothing better than a manager who not only understands what you want from your career (even if it's totally unrelated to the current mission) and goes out of their way to ensure those dreams come true. Be that manager!  Want more tips on how to make a high-performing team?
