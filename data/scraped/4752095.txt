 2000*  That‚Äôs how many days I‚Äôve been working at Chargebee and what a journey it has been!¬†  ¬†From being one of the first SDRs in the company and learning the basics of the business, being part of the team to build the customer success function to leading a global team, it has been very easily THE MOST enriching and fulfilling experience in my professional life so far. One only gets lucky to be at the right place, at the right place with the right people doing the right things. Chargebee turned out to be that for me for all the right reasons.¬†  Growth opportunities - Check ‚úÖ Leaders and Mentors to look up to and guide you - Check ‚úÖ People who genuinely care about you and your work - Check ‚úÖ Empathetic, approachable, and employee-friendly leadership - Check ‚úÖ  Chargebee was my first foray into the SaaS world and boy was I surprised (pleasantly!) about the awesomeness and the impact of the industry. I‚Äôve had the good fortune to learn from folks who are best at what they do and through them learn not just about the company but also about the industry as a whole. I wouldn‚Äôt be here at this stage in my career without others sharing their knowledge and wisdom.¬†  There has been so much learning through my career at Chargebee that I can write a small book! But here are some of the top learnings that have shaped my trajectory from an SDR to Global head of account management at Chargebee:   Towards the next 2000 days!!    General Manager at Prasad Organics P Ltd To many more successful days of learning and teaching ahead:) Very nice article RK!!
