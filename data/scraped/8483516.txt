					 After a dramatic season 10, the “Vanderpump Rules” cast reunited for a highly anticipated 11th season. It seems that fans of the Bravo series can expect the upcoming season to have some intense moments. According to Reality Blurb, Tom Sandoval, who received backlash after having a romantic relationship with his castmate Raquel Leviss in season 10, had an uncomfortable interaction during jeweler Kyle Chan’s San Francisco party while filming the season 11 finale. The publication reported social media videos showed an unidentified individual flinging a glass with liquid inside toward Sandoval and later grabbing a chair. The Schwartz & Sandy’s co-owner seemed to attempt to remove the chair before someone else, presumably a member of security, intervened.  “Vanderpump Rules” star Lala Kent shared information about filming the season 11 finale during a September 7 Amazon Live. She described the event as a “weird night” that “ended awesome.” Kent also stated that she enjoyed herself at Chan’s party until the interaction between Sandoval and the unnamed guest.  “I did have a good time. Until I didn’t and glass was being thrown, which was a complete shock,” said the 33-year-old.  She explained the situation “became chaotic very quickly.”  “[It] ended with me hiding behind a curtain, sobbing my eyes out after they called wrap,” said Kent.   She revealed that she also had heated interactions with her castmates. The mother of one shared, “There was kind of a moment in time where [she] was kind of yelling at everybody.”  “I lost my mind too, veins in my neck popping out, all this pent up energy where I was like a fire-breathing dragon,” shared the Bravo star.   She stated that after she aired her grievances, she was comforted by her co-stars.     A post shared by kristendoute 🦋🤟🏽 (@kristendoute)  Former “Vanderpump Rules” star Kristen Doute and her boyfriend, Luke Broderick, were also in attendance at Chan’s event. While recording the September 7 episode of her podcast, “Sex, Love, and What Else Matters,” Doute and Broderick shared information about what happened during the “Vanderpump Rules” season 11 finale. Doute said she was unaware of what led to the unnamed individual throwing a drink. She stated, however, that the guest was one of Chan’s friends and appeared to be inebriated. “I’m pretty sure he was just super drunk, and he threw a champagne bottle, then a glass of water and then a chair was picked up … Homeboy was just wild, maybe just drunk, I don’t know if he had a vendetta,” said Doute.  She also stated that she was informed that the guest seemed to want to be featured on “Vanderpump Rules.”  “I did hear rumblings of him trying to kind of like grab — like be in front of the camera, go up to cast members on ‘Vanderpump.’ So I think he was kind of an annoyance but maybe he was just a little overserved,” said the former “Vanderpump Rules” star.  Doute also asserted that the moment was authentic and was not “staged for the show.”  “It was not a set up but it was f***** wild,” said the 40-year-old.     A post shared by Katie Maloney (@musickillskate)  Kent, who joined “Vanderpump Rules” in 2016, teased she had some difficulty filming the show’s 11th season in an August 8 Amazon Live. She seemed to reference the aftermath of Sandoval and Leviss’ affair. She explained that the cast has had “a shift in the dynamic” following Sandoval’s March 2023 breakup from Ariana Madix.   “It is the funkiest season I have ever filmed in my life,” said Kent.
