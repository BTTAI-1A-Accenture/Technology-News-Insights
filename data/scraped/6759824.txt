When Boeing rolled out the double-decker jet more than five decades ago, the aviation industry was fascinated by its sheer size. The idea of having two floors of seating at a height approaching six stories was new. According to the manufacturer:
                     "The historic 747, dubbed the ‘Queen of the Skies,’ revolutionized air travel as the world’s first twin-aisle airplane and enabled more people to fly farther, faster and more affordably than ever before. Marked by its distinctively recognizable hump, this iconic airplane is a symbol of great engineering, innovation and often noted as an outstanding work of architecture."
                         "Since production began in 1967, and the first 747-100 completed its first test flight in 1969, more than 100 customers have purchased 1,574 aircraft, logging more than 118 million flight hours and nearly 23 million flight cycles."
                         The Boeing 747's most notable and talked-about feature is its semi-upper deck, which provides exclusive space for select passengers. But why can't passengers board this area directly? Let's find out.

                         Readers lucky enough to travel on the upper deck of the Boeing 747 will know how the boarding routine pans out. Having entered the aircraft on its lower deck, such passengers can climb the stairs to that forbidden realm atop the main cabin. This is an enthralling experience, but could it be avoided with direct boarding, with a jetbridge that connects to the top floor?
                         There is a door on the upper deck, so wouldn't it be feasible to board passengers directly, saving them the trip upstairs? In practice, this would not work for multiple reasons. Firstly, the deck's capacity is minimal. So, the infrastructure required for another jetbridge wouldn't be worth it for just a few passengers.
                         Crucially, the door on the upper deck is used primarily as an emergency exit, as a slide in the door's mechanism means that this safety feature would block the jetbridge. Additionally, the door in question opens upwards, which further complicates matters.

                         However, the Airbus A380 contrasts with the 747 in this regard. A key difference between the A380 and the 747 is that the former has a full upper deck. As such, investing in the infrastructure to have jetbridges serving the upper deck is easier to justify, as far more passengers use this plane area. As seen below, the jetbridges offer step-free access to the upper deck.
                         Of course, contingencies must be in place for the rare occurrence when an upper deck jetbridge might not be available. In this instance, passengers climb the stairs, but what about wheelchair users? For this purpose, the A380 features an internal stairlift. Simple Flying took a closer look at this equipment in an article last year.

     This will leave the Korean carrier with only four passenger 747s.                     While the upper deck 747 can't be boarded, several nuances have been related to it throughout the decades. The spiral staircase was a phenomenon in the jumbo's early years, representing a luxury era in air travel. Moreover, Delta Air Lines promoted the sale of a 'flying penthouse' on the top deck. KLM was a pioneer with its stretched upper deck on the 747-200, which would soon become a standard feature of the type.
                         Since 1968, Boeing has produced 1,574 examples of what must be one of the most recognizable commercial aircraft ever. While the 747's Majesty is revered worldwide, demand for such large quad jets has sunk recently, and production has ended.
                         The final 747 to be produced was handed over in January this year. Atlas Air was the airline that took the last-ever delivery of the legend. According to data from ch-aviation.com, just over 350 active 747s, comprising all the type's variants, are left worldwide. The -400 is the most active model.
                         However, with the overall program complete and existing examples only increasing, this figure will likely fall. Nonetheless, the new 747-8 series will mean that the jumbo jet will remain the 'Queen of the skies' for a little while longer.

Looking at what passengers can expect in the coming years. Alaska Airlines operates six different variants of the 737 in its mainline fleet. Kelly Ortberg, who replaced David Calhoun, began his tenure as the plane maker's chief executive on August 8th. Qatar Airways Boeing 787-9 features a new "mini-QSuite" business cabin.
