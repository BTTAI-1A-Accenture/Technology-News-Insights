A crash involving four vehicles left people injured and closed Route 22 East Monday morning in Lehigh County. The crash was reported at 6:58 a.m. on Route 22 East between Route 309 and Cedar Crest Boulevard in South Whitehall Township, Trooper Nate Branosky said. People were injured in the collision. All lanes of Route 22 East were closed, and the left lane of Route 22 West was also closed. A box truck crashed through the concrete median from the eastbound lanes into the westbound side of the highway. A tractor-trailer and multiple cars were on the shoulder of Route 22 East, as emergency vehicles traveled west in the eastbound lanes to access the crash site. Traffic was snarled in both directions and Branosky said drivers should expect delays. By 9 a.m., the ramp was blocked from Interstate 78 to Route 22 East. While all lanes of Route 22 East were closed to traffic, crews were able to open a single lane to get stranded drivers past the crash site. A crane was set up on the highway to remove the box truck from the median. While a single lane of traffic was getting by on the westbound side, traffic was lining up to MacArthur Road.
