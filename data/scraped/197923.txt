 A 4.3-magnitude earthquake occurred 51 miles south-east of Bermuda, according to the US Geological Survey. The quake happened at a depth of 4.7 miles yesterday afternoon, the American monitoring agency said. A 4.5-magnitude earthquake last month happened 348 miles west of Bermuda at a depth of 5.9 miles. Dr Martin Brewer, a geologist who lives in Bermuda, said he had measured the quake slightly differently from the USGS. He put the earthquake at a 4.1 magnitude, and located it as being 46 miles from the island. Dr Brewer told The Royal Gazette: ”It is the biggest one we have had for some years this close. “It would be the biggest since a 4.6-magnitude one in 2011 and that one was felt by some people.” You must be Registered or Signed in to post comment or to vote.
