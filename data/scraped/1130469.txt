CHARLESTON, W.Va. — The state Senate passed a House bill Monday that would recognize an unborn child as a victim in DUI with death cases. The House of Delegates approved HB 3302 earlier this session. “If says if you drive under the influence and you cause a wreck and you terminate a woman’s pregnancy, you’re going to be treated under the law as if killed an adult or a child who had been born,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Trump explained during Monday’s floor session. The bill passed 32-0. The Senate made some changes to the original bill that it’s asking the House to approve. The Senate gave final approval to HB 3044 Monday. The bill provides for the annual $1,000 fee for limited video lottery terminal permits to be cut to $500 if new updated machines outperform the net income of the older machines. “This bill represents an incentive for licensee’s to replace their older machines with new ones,” Senate Finance Committee Chair Eric Tarr, R-Putnam, said Monday. The Senate also approved and sent back to the House Monday HB 3114 that would deny severance pay to Department of Transportation probationary employees or fail or refuse drug testing. Senator Mike Caputo, D-Marion, said he was surprised probationary employees were eligible for a severance package. Senator Jack Woodrum, R-Summers, told Caputo that it’s happened two times to the DOT and the agency wants to close the loophole. Meanwhile, SB 243, which would require substance use disorder inpatient providers to provide transportation to patients, may be headed toward a conference committee. The bill passed the Senate on Jan. 30. The House made several changes and sent it back to the Senate on Feb. 15. But now neither side has agreed to the changes. The House refused to concur and sent it back to the Senate Monday.  Contact Us  |  Privacy Policy  |  Employment  |  Affiliates Intranet
