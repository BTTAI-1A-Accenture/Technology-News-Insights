E-mart Inc. CEO Kang Heui-seok announces the company’s business strategies for Shinsegae Universe membership service during a press meeting at the COEX convention center in Seoul on June. 8, 2023. (Yonhap) SEOUL, June 14 (Korea Bizwire) — South Korean retail giant Shinsegae Group has formed partnerships with major retailers to reduce the influence of e-commerce operator Coupang Inc. Gmarket, the group’s online shopping subsidiary, said Tuesday it will carry out a special promotion in collaboration with Auction, CJ Cheiljedang Corp., LG Household & Health Care Ltd., and Coca-Cola Korea until June 25. Members of Gmarket and Auction will receive a 15 percent discount coupon for Shinsegae Universe. Furthermore, Shinsegae plans to launch a collaboration package event where customers can receive a free LG H&H product when purchasing a CJ Cheiljedang product, or vice versa. Other subsidiaries of the group, such as E-Mart and SSG.com, will also participate in this promotional event. Some industry watchers suggest that this promotion can be viewed as a joint response by Shinsegae, CJ Cheiljedang, and LG H&H to curb the influence of Coupang. This collaboration comes after a dispute over pricing led CJ Cheiljedang and LG H&H to withdraw from the e-commerce retailer. Gmarket, E-Mart, and SSG.com, which are leading this event, are retail subsidiaries of Shinsegae and are part of the recently launched online and offline integrated membership program called Shinsegae Universe.
