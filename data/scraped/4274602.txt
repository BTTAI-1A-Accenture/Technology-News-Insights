 I remember recruiting a fresh executive from an outside location to our HO in Mumbai. He had just left college and looking for a new opportunity.  A young man in his early 20s, very lean in a white shirt, and black trousers walked into our office on his joining day. He was visibly nervous, leaving his home city, relocating here, his first job, and a new environment where  he was obviously  lonely amongst the clutter &  and buzz of the morning Office chores. On his table was the welcome kit from the Company, an envelope with documents to complete his joining formalities and his induction program, listing details of his hourwise engagements. A representative from the HR team spoke to him for about 10-15 minutes and left him to complete the doables. Of course, he completed his joining formalities on Day 1 and went on with his induction program as planned.  Over the next few days, I noticed, he continued to be quiet, reserved, and to himself. I checked with him after a couple of days and came to know that he was running fever ! I spoke to him and assured him, that we are there for him for anything he requires, personally / professionally! Maybe it was the anxiety in the new environment, maybe he was feeling lonely; maybe he was missing home and that led to his being unwell- I don't know !  What stayed with me  as a Leader was, do we make the ADDITIONAL effort  to make our team members comfortable on Day 1(we may be doing this for our immediate reports)? Are we sufficiently empathetic to them - or dismiss them as lower-rung employees?  Day 1 whether in college, or office is like a Monster,  overwhelming & and scary! As they go along the journey, they acclimatize, evolve, change, and fit themselves into the system, as kids learn to swim when pushed into the pool. Do you resonate with this ? Would love to know your comments. P.S.- this guy had an illustrious career with us for ~7 years, before he moved back to his hometown! #Day1 #Empathy #Leadership #Communication
