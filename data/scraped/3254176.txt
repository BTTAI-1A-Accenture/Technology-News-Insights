In this article Which? members can exclusively read the results of our unique customer satisfaction survey. Members can log in to see our review of Santander. If you're not already a member, join Which? and get full access to these results and all our reviews.  To become a Which? Recommended Provider (WRP) for either stocks and shares Isas or general investment accounts, a platform needs to have a customer score of at least 70%, not be in the top 25% most expensive in one of our fees scenarios, and not score lower than three stars in any category.  On top of these criteria, we apply statistical tests that place the platforms into ‘bands’, and only the platforms in the highest band – the ones that really stand out against the rest – can be a WRP. Which?'s rating for customer satisfaction is based on feedback from customers. We ask investors to rate their current platform for its ease of use, overall customer service and customer communications, whether it represents value for money, if they are satisfied with it overall and whether they would recommend it to someone else. In January 2024, we heard 4,136 reviews and gave customer scores to 17 do-it-yourself investment platforms. Each platform must have at least 30 responses, a minimum of three investments to choose from yourself, and not offer contract for difference (CFD) trading to receive a customer score. There's no difference in fees whether you're investing in a Santander Investment Hub stocks and shares Isa or a general investment account. Annual platform charge:  Trading charge:  Fund charge:  We've estimated the cost of investing over the course of a year in a Santander Investment Hub stocks and shares Isa, assuming you make four purchases and four sales each year.  Costs will vary depending on how much you invest.  Correct as of January 2024 Santander Investment Hub has a page on its website that lists all of the ‘sustainable’ funds available on its platform, though there is no further information on the funds beyond this. For example, there is no detail of which sectors funds invest in or the top 10 holdings. Santander is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). When you invest with an investment platform that's registered with the Financial Conduct Authority, your money will be ring-fenced and should be returned if a company goes bust without you having to wait alongside other creditors. If ring-fencing failed, you would be compensated by the FSCS. The FSCS will cover up to £85,000 of investments per person, per platform. You can claim for free online at www.fca.org.uk; there's no reason to use a claims management company. You won't be compensated for investments falling in value, or if a company in which you hold shares goes bust, unless this poor performance resulted from bad advice given by a regulated Independent Financial Advisor that has since gone bankrupt. free newsletter Get a firmer grip on your finances with the expert tips in our Money newsletter – it's free weekly.
