 A significant medical breakthrough is desperately needed in the fight against metastatic breast cancer. As it stands right now, metastatic breast cancer has no cure and has proven resistant to many cancer treatments. However, there may be hope on the horizon for the 43,000 women that die every year from the disease. In fact, companies such as BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (NASDAQ: BCTX) (TSX: BCT) are already reporting positive survival data in advanced cases of metastatic breast cancer. We should also point out that, according to Research and Markets.com, the global breast cancer drug market could be worth $27.04 billion by 2026. Global Markets Insights also says that number could be closer to $43 billion by 2028, with further advances in breast cancer care. Also helping with the fight against breast cancer are companies, such as Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Puma Biotechnology (NASDAQ: PBYI), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD), and ImmunoGen (NASDAQ: IMGN).    Look at BriaCell Therapeutics (NASDAQ: BCTX) (TSX: BCT), For Example   BriaCell Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in targeted immunotherapies for cancer, announced that it has entered into an arrangement agreement dated May 24, 2023 with BriaPro Therapeutics Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company pursuant to which certain pre-clinical pipeline assets of the Company, including Bria-TILsRx™ and protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) inhibitors for multiple indications including cancer, will be spun-out to SpinCo by way of a court approved statutory plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). “As we focus on Bria-IMT’s upcoming pivotal study, we believe that this strategy of spinning out our preclinical immunotherapies in a separate entity of BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. will position them for success and will create our shareholders value over the long term,” stated Dr. William V. Williams, BriaCell’s President and CEO. “We continue with our mission to develop novel immunotherapies to fight cancer and improve patients’ lives whose medical needs are currently unmet.” Pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement, SpinCo will acquire the entire right and interest in and to the SpinCo Assets in consideration for the issuance by SpinCo to the Company of SpinCo common shares. Under the terms of the Arrangement, for each BriaCell share held immediately prior to closing, BriaCell shareholders will receive one (1) common share of SpinCo, and one (1) new common share of BriaCell having the same terms and characteristics as the existing BriaCell common shares. SpinCo Shares issued to BriaCell shareholders will, in aggregate, represent 33.33% ownership of SpinCo Shares upon closing of the Arrangement, with BriaCell initially retaining a 66.67% ownership interest in SpinCo. BriaCell shareholders who receive SpinCo Shares will ultimately own shares in both companies: BriaCell, which will continue with its mission to develop targeted immunotherapies for cancer, and SpinCo, which will focus on the development of the SpinCo Assets. Under the terms of the Arrangement, existing holders of BriaCell warrants shall receive upon exercise of such BriaCell warrant, for the original exercise price: one (1) BriaCell common share for each BriaCell common share that was issuable upon due exercise of a BriaCell warrant immediately prior to the consumation of the Arrangement and one (1) SpinCo Share for each BriaCell common share that was issuable upon exercise of the BriaCell warrant immediately prior to the Arrangement.  Following the Arrangement, BriaCell will remain listed on both the NASDAQ Capital Market and Toronto Stock Exchange, and SpinCo will become an unlisted reporting issuer in Canada.

These data represent the first clinical evidence that stimulating the endogenous PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be an effective approach to treat rheumatologic disease. The phase 2a clinical trial (NCT04634253) evaluated the safety and efficacy of peresolimab in adult participants with moderate-to-severe RA who had an inadequate response to prior conventional, biologic or synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
