   Date (MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq)  DEERFIELD, Ill., May 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Surgalign Holdings, Inc., (NASDAQ: SRGA) a global medical technology company focused on elevating the standard of care by driving the evolution of digital surgery, today announced financial results for its 2023 first quarter ended March 31, 2023.   2023   First   Quarter and Subsequent Corporate Highlights:     Launch of HOLOTM AI Insights for Spine Imaging; collaboration with Dr. Alexander Vaccaro, Dr. Pierce Nunley and Spine Institute of Louisiana, and leading neuro and orthopedic spine surgeons and San Diego Spine Foundation.   Launch of HOLO AI Insights for Neurovascular Research; collaboration with Dr. Brian Jankowitz, a fellowship trained cerebrovascular neurosurgeon, for neurovascular research.   HOLO PortalTM Surgical Guidance System (“HOLO Portal”) upgrades unveiled; next generation software and new surgical tool integration to improve system functionality and drive further adoption.   Two new sites added in May 2023 for HOLO Portal; onboarding underway with cases to be scheduled.   HOLO Portal expansion into Texas; first case performed by Dr. Ripul Panchal, DO of Medical City Frisco, part of HCA Healthcare.   Sale of its Coflex® and CoFixTM product lines for $17.0 million, raising net proceeds of $14.8 million.   “Throughout 2023, we have advanced our HOLO AI portfolio with an upgraded HOLO Portal system, and the launch of HOLO AI Insights for research-use for both spine imaging and neurovascular research,” stated Terry Rich, President and Chief Executive Officer.“This was made possible by the invaluable feedback from the medical community, and we couldn't be happier to be working with such world-class physicians to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence. We are focused on further enhancements to our AI platform with a goal to expedite commercialization efforts as we capitalize on the Digital Health opportunity.” Mr. Rich continued,“With the sale of our Coflex and CoFix product lines in February, we strengthened our balance sheet and extended our cash runway, while our restructuring initiatives are progressing accordingly to plan. We will remain vigilant in our capital allocation and continue to explore strategic paths to improve liquidity and provide the resources needed to execute on our vision.”   Financial Update   Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $16.7 million as compared to $20.6 million in the comparable year-ago period, a decline of $3.9 million. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, total revenue declined by $3.9 million. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily related to a significant reduction in product offerings as part of the Company's ongoing restructuring efforts, lower international revenue resulting from wind down of the international business, and lost revenue from the sale of the Coflex® and CoFixTM product lines in February 2023. The Company reported gross margin of 63.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to gross margin of 68.9% in the comparable year-ago period, a reduction of 520 basis points. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, gross margin improved by 7730 basis points. The sequential increase in gross profit was primarily related to product rationalization initiatives during the fourth quarter of 2022, which led to significant charges to cost of goods sold in that period. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported adjusted gross margin of 69.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to adjusted gross margin of 70.9% in the comparable year-ago period, a reduction of 140 basis points. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted gross margin decreased by 240 basis points. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $24.4 million as compared to $23.1 million in the comparable year-ago period, an increase of $1.3 million or 5.8%. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses declined by approximately $20.9 million. The primary drivers for the sequential improvement in operating expenses were a $17.5 million decline in transaction and financing expenses related to the Company's November 2022 warrant offering, and a $1.3 million decline in general and administrative expenses, primarily related to restructuring. On a non-GAAP basis, total adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $23.0 million, as compared to $28.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter was a gain of $1.1 million due to adjustments to the fair value of Holo Surgical Inc. contingent consideration, $0.6 million in asset impairment charges, $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, $0.5 million in transaction and financing expenses, and $0.5 million in severance and restructuring costs. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, total adjusted operating expenses declined by approximately $1.6 million. The Company reported an operating loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to an operating loss of $8.9 million in the comparable year-ago period and an operating loss of $48.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $4.1 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $0.0 million in the comparable year-ago period and a net loss from continuing operations of $39.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a loss of $10.8 million. This compares to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $13.3 million in the comparable year-ago period and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $9.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $22.4 million, as compared to $16.3 million reported as of December 31, 2022. The Company continues to implement a corporate-wide review of its organizational structure, processes and costs, along with continued product rationalization initiatives. The restructuring plan began during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continues today.   Conference Call   Surgalign will host a conference call and audio webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET today.

In addition, we disclose EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The calculation of the tax effect on the adjustments between GAAP net loss applicable to common shares and non-GAAP net income applicable to common shares is based upon our estimated annual GAAP tax rate, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP net loss applicable to common shares in calculating non-GAAP net loss applicable to common shares. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the reconciliations below. The following are explanations of the adjustments that management excluded as part of the non-GAAP measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Management removes the amount of these costs including the tax effect on the adjustments from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance. 2023 and 2022 Non-cash stock-based compensation – These costs relate to expense amortization for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock options and the employee stock purchase plan purchase rights. 2023 and 2022 Foreign exchange (gain) loss– These costs relate to the process of remeasuring international activity into the Company's functional currency. 2023 and 2022 Change in fair value of warrant liability – Other income related to the revaluation of our warrant liability. 2023 and 2022 Gain on acquisition contingency – The gain on acquisition contingency relates to an adjustment to our estimate of obligation for future milestone payments on the Holo Surgical acquisition. 2023 and 2022 Asset impairment and abandonments – These costs relate to asset impairment and abandonments of certain long-term assets within the asset group. 2023 and 2022 Transaction and financing expenses – These costs relate to professional fees associated with financings, issuance costs for the underwritten public offering, and service related to sale of the Company's Coflex inventory line. 2023 and 2022 Inventory purchase price adjustment – These costs relate to the purchase price effects of acquired Paradigm inventory that was sold during the two months of January and February of 2023 prior to the sale of inventory line, and for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 2023 Severance and restructuring costs – These costs relate to employee related severance costs as a result of the Company's organization restructuring plan. 2023 Gain on sale of Coflex – Gain related to the sale of the Company's Coflex and Cofix product lines in the United States. 2023 Product rationalization – These costs relate to inventory write downs associated with the wind down of the international business. Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares should not be considered in isolation, or as a replacement for GAAP measures. Usefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors The Company believes that presenting EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares in addition to the related GAAP measures provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial decision-making.

MENAFN11052023004107003653ID1106229709 DEERFIELD, Ill., May 11, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Surgalign Holdings, Inc., (NASDAQ: SRGA) a global medical technology company focused on elevating the standard of care by driving the evolution of digital surgery, today announced financial results for its 2023 first quarter ended March 31, 2023.   2023   First   Quarter and Subsequent Corporate Highlights:   “Throughout 2023, we have advanced our HOLO AI portfolio with an upgraded HOLO Portal system, and the launch of HOLO AI Insights for research-use for both spine imaging and neurovascular research,” stated Terry Rich, President and Chief Executive Officer.“This was made possible by the invaluable feedback from the medical community, and we couldn't be happier to be working with such world-class physicians to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence. We are focused on further enhancements to our AI platform with a goal to expedite commercialization efforts as we capitalize on the Digital Health opportunity.” Mr. Rich continued,“With the sale of our Coflex and CoFix product lines in February, we strengthened our balance sheet and extended our cash runway, while our restructuring initiatives are progressing accordingly to plan. We will remain vigilant in our capital allocation and continue to explore strategic paths to improve liquidity and provide the resources needed to execute on our vision.”   Financial Update   Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $16.7 million as compared to $20.6 million in the comparable year-ago period, a decline of $3.9 million. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, total revenue declined by $3.9 million. The sequential decrease in revenue was primarily related to a significant reduction in product offerings as part of the Company's ongoing restructuring efforts, lower international revenue resulting from wind down of the international business, and lost revenue from the sale of the Coflex® and CoFixTM product lines in February 2023. The Company reported gross margin of 63.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to gross margin of 68.9% in the comparable year-ago period, a reduction of 520 basis points. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, gross margin improved by 7730 basis points. The sequential increase in gross profit was primarily related to product rationalization initiatives during the fourth quarter of 2022, which led to significant charges to cost of goods sold in that period. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported adjusted gross margin of 69.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to adjusted gross margin of 70.9% in the comparable year-ago period, a reduction of 140 basis points. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, adjusted gross margin decreased by 240 basis points. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $24.4 million as compared to $23.1 million in the comparable year-ago period, an increase of $1.3 million or 5.8%. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, total operating expenses declined by approximately $20.9 million. The primary drivers for the sequential improvement in operating expenses were a $17.5 million decline in transaction and financing expenses related to the Company's November 2022 warrant offering, and a $1.3 million decline in general and administrative expenses, primarily related to restructuring. On a non-GAAP basis, total adjusted operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2023 were $23.0 million, as compared to $28.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Excluded from non-GAAP operating expenses for the 2023 first quarter was a gain of $1.1 million due to adjustments to the fair value of Holo Surgical Inc. contingent consideration, $0.6 million in asset impairment charges, $1.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation, $0.5 million in transaction and financing expenses, and $0.5 million in severance and restructuring costs. On a sequential basis when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, total adjusted operating expenses declined by approximately $1.6 million. The Company reported an operating loss of $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to an operating loss of $8.9 million in the comparable year-ago period and an operating loss of $48.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was $4.1 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $0.0 million in the comparable year-ago period and a net loss from continuing operations of $39.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was a loss of $10.8 million. This compares to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $13.3 million in the comparable year-ago period and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $9.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $22.4 million, as compared to $16.3 million reported as of December 31, 2022. The Company continues to implement a corporate-wide review of its organizational structure, processes and costs, along with continued product rationalization initiatives. The restructuring plan began during the fourth quarter of 2022 and continues today.   Conference Call   Surgalign will host a conference call and audio webcast at 4:30 p.m. ET today.

Investor and Media Relations Contact:  Glenn WienerGW CommunicationsT: +1 (917) 887 8434E:         Non-GAAP Financial Measures   To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose non-GAAP net loss applicable to common shares, non-GAAP net loss per diluted share, non-GAAP operating expenses, and non-GAAP gross profit, in each case adjusted for certain amounts. In addition, we disclose EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The calculation of the tax effect on the adjustments between GAAP net loss applicable to common shares and non-GAAP net income applicable to common shares is based upon our estimated annual GAAP tax rate, adjusted to account for items excluded from GAAP net loss applicable to common shares in calculating non-GAAP net loss applicable to common shares. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the reconciliations below. The following are explanations of the adjustments that management excluded as part of the non-GAAP measures for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Management removes the amount of these costs including the tax effect on the adjustments from our operating results to supplement a comparison to our past operating performance. 2023 and 2022 Non-cash stock-based compensation – These costs relate to expense amortization for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors, including restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock options and the employee stock purchase plan purchase rights. 2023 and 2022 Foreign exchange (gain) loss– These costs relate to the process of remeasuring international activity into the Company's functional currency. 2023 and 2022 Change in fair value of warrant liability – Other income related to the revaluation of our warrant liability. 2023 and 2022 Gain on acquisition contingency – The gain on acquisition contingency relates to an adjustment to our estimate of obligation for future milestone payments on the Holo Surgical acquisition. 2023 and 2022 Asset impairment and abandonments – These costs relate to asset impairment and abandonments of certain long-term assets within the asset group. 2023 and 2022 Transaction and financing expenses – These costs relate to professional fees associated with financings, issuance costs for the underwritten public offering, and service related to sale of the Company's Coflex inventory line. 2023 and 2022 Inventory purchase price adjustment – These costs relate to the purchase price effects of acquired Paradigm inventory that was sold during the two months of January and February of 2023 prior to the sale of inventory line, and for the three months ended March 31, 2022. 2023 Severance and restructuring costs – These costs relate to employee related severance costs as a result of the Company's organization restructuring plan. 2023 Gain on sale of Coflex – Gain related to the sale of the Company's Coflex and Cofix product lines in the United States. 2023 Product rationalization – These costs relate to inventory write downs associated with the wind down of the international business. Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares should not be considered in isolation, or as a replacement for GAAP measures. Usefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors The Company believes that presenting EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income Applicable to Common Shares in addition to the related GAAP measures provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management in its financial decision-making.
