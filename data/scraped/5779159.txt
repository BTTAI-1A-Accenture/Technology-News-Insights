By Rod Walton, Senior Editor, EnergyTech and Microgrid Knowlege Solar power investment is going sky high and double-fisted these days.      A new report by the International Energy Agency estimates that investment in clean, carbon-reducing energy technologies will top $1.8  trillion around the world in 2023. Solar power accounts for a record $1  trillion-plus this year, perhaps topping even the long-king oil and gas  industries, according to IEA's world energy investment report.    That’s the sky high part. Reaching and topping $1 trillion, or ten digits, is the double-fisted part for the solar power movement. “Clean  energy is moving fast—faster than many people realize,” IEA Executive  Director Faith Birol said in the release accompanying the group’s  report. “This is clear in the investment trends, where clean  technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels.”  The tabulations from worldwide energy ministries, developers and investment firms highlight a curve estimating that clean energy spending  has been rising 24 percent from 2021 through the end of this year.  Renewable energy projects both on the macro and microgrid side, as well  as electric vehicle and charging infrastructure spending, account for  the majority of that growth, according to the IEA.  The paths to  Net Zero are many, from investment in renewables and EVs to hydrogen,  carbon capture, small nuclear, battery storage and building energy  efficiency tools. The move toward decarbonization in developed economies  has sustained a momentum which does not seem to be slowing down. That  is not to say that fossil fuel investment is fading to zero, net or  gross, anytime soon. Projects around coal, natural gas and oil are still  attracting more than $1 trillion and have risen 15 percent from  2021-23, according to the IEA. The overwhelming majority of that  fossil-fuel project growth has come from large and developing nations  such as China and India, the IEA says. This trend “presents a  serious risk of new dividing lines in global energy if clean energy  transitions don’t pick up elsewhere,” the IEA release reads. This  worry was stressed by private equity giant BlackRock founder and CEO  Larry Fink in a talk during the Global Energy Summit last month at  Columbia University. The energy transition investment may require $100  trillion or more to reach Net Zero goals by 2050, but Fink acknowledged  the dangers of rich nations forgetting what developing nations need to  join in the transition.  “We’re really not being truthful to ourselves,” Fink said in the interview with Jason Bordoff, founding director at the Center for Global  Energy Policy at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs.   “This is where I’m an alarmist,” Fink admitted. “If we want to  be faithful to this (goal) we need emerging countries to come along with  us.”  And yet China also is a global leader in EVs and builds more renewable capacity that the U.S. in overall dollars  equivalent, if not per-capita spending. So the pace of decarbonization,  while not completely headwind-free, is inspiring much optimism among  global energy leaders such as the IEA’s Birol. “For every dollar  invested in fossil fuels, about 1.7 dollars are now going into clean  energy,” he pointed out. “Five years ago, this ratio was one-to-one. One  shining example is investment in solar, which is set to overtake the  amount of investment going into oil production for the first time.” Yet  the tide has hardly turned completely. Current fossil fuel investment  is more than twice the level needed in key Net Zero Emissions by 2050  calculations, the IEA warned. Oil giants are reaping the benefits  of higher prices, with U.S. leader ExxonMobil reporting $56 billion in  earnings last year. Yet even ExxonMobil, while still reaping the  benefits of profitable drilling fields, is committed to investing in  clean energy technologies.  One of those was a $125 million investment in renewable diesel development announced last year. Companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell  also are exploring carbon capture, utilization and storage projects to  offset and mitigate oil and gas emissions.
