Ah, itâs the first weekend of the new year â and here comes Masa y MÃ¡s to supercharge a certain section of South Lamar with the vibrant taste of Central Mexico.â¨ The new taqueria will open on Friday, Jan. 6, starting off what we imagine will be a long, long run of deliciousness at the weird and sprawling corner of South Lamar & Mary. You may recall that this venue was, for a long time, the original location of Austinâs Pizza â but now the siteâs been revamped by Larry Perdido and Chuck Smith (of Moonshine and Hopdoddy fame, no less) along with partner and chef Roberto Campos, the place reborn as a counter-service restaurant with a welcoming dining room and covered patio. [Note: Is it part of official City code that every decent dining spot in South Austin has to have a covered patio, or are we just dreaming? We elected you, Kirk â so get on that shit, willya?] Of course, in this section of your Austin Chronicle, business and architecture is always rather secondary, isnât it? Something something Daily Food, right? Thatâs why weâre most excited about chef Camposâ slow-roasted barbacoa from Guerrero, Mexico City-style suadero, birria rich with its Jalisco heritage, and â beyond the regionally redolent tacos â the papas rellenas, tortas, bowls, and a panoply of fresh, savor-abetting sides. Also, the place is called Masa y MÃ¡s for a reason: All the flour, yellow, and blue corn tortillas will be made in-house using methods passed down from chef Camposâ grandmother. âAt a young age I started supporting my familyâs carros ambulantes (food carts) in Guanajuato, Mexico, kneading masa for my grandmotherâs gorditas and chopping vegetables for my momâs pico de gallo,â says chef Campos. âThe recipes and ingredients youâll find at Masa y MÃ¡s represent not only my culture and roots but also my familyâs deep traditions. My goal is for everyone who steps foot in my restaurant to experience a piece of my home.â Now, weâre not sure precisely what beverage possibilities obtained in the talented chefâs childhood hacienda, but this new home of deep flavor will serve agua frescas, margaritas and other cocktails, and a curated selection of mezcal, tequila, rum, and Mexican-imported beers. So we reckon weâll be eating and drinking in Austintatious pleasure in this bright joint at 1817 S. Lamar, which is open six days a week: Tue.-Thu., 11am-10pm; Fri.-Sat., 11am-12midnight; Sun., 8am-1pm. Bonus for artlovers: One wall of Masa y MÃ¡s showcases a colorful mural â an homage to chef Camposâ mother, Maria Concepcion â by Austin-based Peruvian artist Niz.
