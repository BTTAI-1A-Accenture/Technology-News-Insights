View Our Print IssuesBack to Main Site  See Our Newsletters Share Right before the holidays, I did a TikTok about holding on tightly to the memories you make during that time, because in January, they tend to be weaponized against you. These precious moments that you only get once a year are suddenly thrown back in your face as a form of failure. And the message seems to be that in order to get out of that, you have to change nearly everything about yourself. In the past, I’ve probably subscribed to this idea—it’s hard not to. If I went back in the history of when I got gym memberships, it’s very likely a lot of them were in January. The start of the year is a predatory time and a highly marketable one, too. We live in a society that guides us through certain thoughts and feelings in order to capitalize on them. In December, it’s all about “overindulging,” then come January, we’re made to feel bad about it.  Oftentimes, new year’s resolutions are built around this kind of shame—that’s how they drive you to be successful. Oftentimes, new year’s resolutions are built around this kind of shame—it’s how they drive you to be successful. We fall trapped into this idea of having to basically hate ourselves happy. One example that’s been challenging for me is getting away from the whole narrative around good foods vs. bad foods, good lifestyle and bad lifestyle. I was a former “weight loss success story,” so I remember posting the sad before photo and the smiley after photo, but I can tell you firsthand that that after photo doesn’t always equal happiness. Even so, I often find myself wanting smoothies and salads in January, and I get in my head about it because I’m afraid that it’s a result of diet culture. But I try to remind myself that our body speaks to us and tells us what it needs. During the holidays, there’s a lot of sitting down, a lot of time spent in cars and a lot of enjoying—I’m not going to say indulging—of all those special foods. So it makes sense for our body to be like, “Hey, you now what? I need a bit more of this right now.”  The key, I think, is asking yourself, “How can I make decisions that are based on really positive, amazing things and not, ‘how am I going to lose all this weight?’ or ‘how am I going to be this better version of myself?’” as if the version of you right now is not already incredibly great! I try to always make sure that any changes I’m considering are grounded in love rather than hate. And I don’t mean love as an emotion—like loving what you see in the mirror—but love as an action: making intentional, loving decisions for ourselves. Personally, I don’t make resolutions. I don’t even like to set goals, because then I feel like if I don’t meet them, I’ve somehow failed, and I don’t ever want to live a life where I feel like I’m failing. What I do love, though, is paying attention to how I can make choices to be my best self every day. Sometimes that’s going to mean change and it’s going to mean intentionality.  These days, for example, I want to be more intentional about making sure that I’m having daily movement that makes me feel really good. I want to be more intentional about calling my mom. I want to be more intentional about making choices that are loving towards myself and towards others. It’s not, “I feel like crap about who I am, so in order for me to be happy, I need to change all these things.” Being more intentional can be totally detached from all of that “new year, new you” messaging. As humans, we are constantly evolving, so it can be wonderful to lean into that evolution of self and be like, “How can I do this in a way that’s not going to be rooted in shame, but instead be rooted in awesome love for myself?” I really hope that we do more of that this January.  —As told to Katherine Lalancette

 Δ Share It was Xena: Warrior Princess that first made me wonder about my sexuality. Over six seasons, as Xena's nebulous relationship with her friend Gabrielle unfolded on my parents' 32" television, I remember asking myself, "What if I'm a lesbian?" That was a bold question in the 1990s. Where I grew up, in Dorchester, Ont. (population: less than 4,500), there was no discussion of sexuality.
