In each year of your degree you will take a number of individual modules, normally valued at 15 or 30 credits, adding up to a total of 120 credits for the year. Modules are assessed in the academic year in which they are taken. The balance of compulsory and optional modules varies from programme to programme and year to year. A 30-credit module is considered equivalent to 15 credits in the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). Upon successful completion of 360 credits, you will be awarded a BEng (Hons) in Civil Engineering. Please note that the list of modules given here is indicative. This information is published a long time in advance of enrolment and module content and availability is subject to change. Modules that are in use for the current academic year are linked for further information. Where no link is present, further information is not yet available. All modules on this programme are compulsory with the exception of the three minor modules (one module in Year 2 and two modules in Year 3) which can be selected from any of the available IEP minor subjects. Students also carry out a research project in Year 3, the topic of which can be agreed from a wide variety of research areas. Our teaching methods are carefully crafted to engage and motivate effective learning. These encompass a variety of approaches such as group projects, interactive lectures, problem-solving sessions, drawing and design workshops, one-on-one tutorials, laboratory sessions and immersive site visits and field trips.
Additionally, we invite external lecturers who are practising engineers to deliver specialised lectures tailored to their areas of expertise, providing invaluable insights and real-world perspectives to enhance your learning experience.
