June 22, 2023 MORGAN, Utah (AP) — An abandoned litter of raccoons discovered at a construction site in northern Utah found new homes last week after a construction crew uncovered the animals below the remnants of a demolished home.

“A big-hearted foreman for the demolition crew working on Morgan Valley Drive came to the fire station asking for help,” the Morgan County Fire Department said in a statement last week. “After his crew knocked down an abandoned home, they heard chirping in the rubble.”
