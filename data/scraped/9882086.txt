Reviewed Updated: Mar 27, 2024, 7:13pm The best free invoice software is not only easy on the bank account but user-friendly and packed with the features that you need to convert quotes or projects into invoices easily so that you can send them to clients and get paid quickly. While there are several free billing software solutions available, Forbes Advisor found the five most valuable that meet the needs of small businesses. When choosing the right free billing software for you, it’s important to choose one that provides the most value to you as they all come with a varying set of features and inclusions. For example, one free plan might limit the number of invoices you can send but includes an unlimited number of clients while another offers the opposite. There are no hidden fees with the best free billing software, but there are a few caveats. For example, they all integrate with major payment processors but not all free plans give you a choice of payment gateway. While free plans are totally free, you still have to pay transaction fees to a payment processor. For these reasons, it’s worth considering what each provider offers in terms of paid plans in case you later decide to upgrade as your business grows.

 The free plan from Square Invoices is a great option for almost any business that uses invoices to bill clients. It’s versatile invoicing software that lets you collect payment in person using Square’s mobile app and card reader, online or via automated clearing house (ACH) bank transfer payment. To ensure you get paid on time, you can set up automatic payment reminders with each invoice. You can stick with the default schedule―one day and three days after the due date―or send customized reminders. If you need to send custom invoices or you want to track projects, you’ll have to upgrade Square Invoices to the paid plan, which costs $20 per month. With the paid plan, you’ll also be able to save time with the ability to save invoice templates and get paid at specific intervals during a longer project with milestone-based payments. Regardless of which plan you choose, the 2.6% to 3.5% transaction fee plus 10 cents to 30 cents is the same. Learn more: Read our full Square Invoices review. Who should use it:  Square Invoices is an excellent choice for any small business that needs free invoicing software. You can accept payments online or in person, and Square offers integrations that are useful for online, service and brick-and-mortar businesses. Starting price for paid plans  None, free plans only

 Zoho Invoice is one of the best free invoicing software options because there are no hidden fees. You’ll have to pay for any transaction fees when clients pay an invoice.

 Invoice Ninja is a feature-packed free invoicing software that makes it easy for you to manage billing for multiple clients and even multiple businesses. You can create an unlimited number of quotes and invoices but the free plan limits you to 50 clients.

A unique feature of Invoice Ninja is that it allows you to send invoices for multiple businesses so that you can manage billing for all your businesses or clients’ businesses with one free account. As with most of the best free invoicing software, Invoice Ninja lets you use payment gateways, such as WePay, Stripe, Authorize.net and PayPal.

 The free billing software that Invoicely offers is far more limiting than its competitors but it comes with the benefit of having an easy-to-use interface and low-cost paid plans that range from $7.99 to $23.99 with annual billing or $9.99 to $29.99 with monthly billing. With its free plan, you can send up to five invoices per month and save up to three clients in your account. You can also send payment reminders with the free plan, but you have to do so manually.

The paid plans do give you useful features, such as payment receipts, automatic payment reminders and quotes or estimates. Who should use it:  Small sellers who exclusively use PayPal to receive payments may find Invoicely a good pick. The free plan is extremely limited but you can send up to five invoices per month easily to three clients and get paid through PayPal. 
 To choose the best free invoicing software, Forbes Advisor researched several billing software options and compared only those with free plans. Each cloud-based app that made our list had to offer a completely free version. We also looked at paid plans and ranked them according to starting price and how expensive the highest tier was, so the titles that made our list are accessible at every level for small businesses. There are many features in billing software that can be helpful to companies, such as product management and inventory control tools, but these aren’t imperative. We looked at unlimited clients, customizable invoices and time-tracking features, to name a few. The free plans with the fewest limitations scored higher than those that offered less. Having no limits to the number of clients you can have or invoices you can send allows you to grow your business. Finally, we considered the overall review rating on other sites for each invoicing software on our list. We also looked at actual reviews from customers to help us choose the best free billing software. Most invoicing software includes base software features, such as the ability to send invoices and receive payments. There are many other features that the top invoicing software offers to make it easier for you to track payments, contact clients and manage inventory and finances. Although keeping accurate stock counts is more vital for businesses that sell physical products, it can still be a viable feature for service-based businesses. Most businesses that use invoicing software track inventory in a separate application. If you choose invoicing software that includes inventory tracking, you can consolidate a bit. Although most invoicing software gives you the ability to send invoices to your clients, a portal for your clients can be even more helpful than an email. A client portal makes it possible for your clients to log into the software to see the progress you’re making on projects and estimates, along with past, current or upcoming invoices. Service-based businesses rely on time tracking tools to keep a running tab on billable and nonbillable hours to use for invoicing. When time tracking is included as a feature in your invoicing software, it can be a huge help. You can instantly turn billable hours into the amount your client owes and send the invoice. Otherwise, you’re stuck doing work in separate software. Having a mobile app for invoicing can be a convenient tool if you often work away from your desk. You can send invoices and payment reminders easily from your phone or tablet anywhere you are as long as you have an internet connection. If you prefer using push notifications, some invoicing mobile apps will let you know when a payment goes through so that you don’t have to keep checking your payment apps or email. Invoicing software that includes reports, prebuilt or custom, can be an eye-opening feature for businesses. With analytics, you can collect data that will help you make future business decisions. You may discover most of your clients pay invoices from their mobile phones or that your customers rarely check payment reminders. Perhaps one of the most important invoicing software features is the ability to integrate with other platforms. If you choose basic invoicing software, you want to make sure it will work with the software you use regularly. At the very least, you want your invoicing software to integrate with accounting software and payment processors. It’s helpful if it also integrates with customer relationship management (CRM) software, marketing tools and time tracking tools. It should come as no surprise that small business owners often look at the pricing of service or software as the most important factor in their choice. Free invoicing software is tempting and some are worth considering, but if you choose a paid plan for an invoicing app, you’re going to get a lot more value. Choosing invoicing software that’s right for your business comes down to what you can afford, what you need and what would be nice to have. New businesses and small business owners that are on a shoestring budget may want to consider free invoicing software to save money. If that’s the case, then you’ll pay with your time. You may have to perform more manual tasks to make free invoicing software work for you. If this describes you, look for invoicing software that offers: If you decide you have money in the budget for a paid plan, consider picking invoicing software that offers tiered plans. The lower-priced plan may include the features you want right now and you can always upgrade as your company grows and you find you need more specific tools: For small businesses that rely on multiple software applications to track customer information, market to clients, track stock levels, purchase from vendors and send invoices, it might be better to look for a comprehensive business suite of tools. Some popular options include Zoho and HubSpot. Even if they’re missing a key feature you need, unified business solutions likely offer an integration that would suffice. Typically, you’ll find these in-house apps or features as add-ons with the base software: Of course, choosing one of these all-in-one options will be pricey. Costs are offset by allowing you to nix other software you were using, though. Plus, the extra features add value. Alternative to using an all-in-one platform that includes invoicing and other business management features is to opt for a business solution that lets you choose the features you need or want. It’s similar to a unified business app, such as Zoho, in that you can pay for the base service and then pay for only the features you need or want.
