If you’re in the market for some gear from the 2023 PGA Championship, get to the merchandise center sooner rather than later. It’s only right that the second men’s major championship of the season would feature some top-notch gear to go along with the world-class field on hand at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York. A wide array of hats, shirts, gear and more are on sale for men, women and children, and the acorn logo is more than fitting as Oak Hill prepares to host the event for a fourth time. Check out the best gear available for purchase at the 2023 PGA Championship at Oak Hill. MORE: PGA Championship live updates
