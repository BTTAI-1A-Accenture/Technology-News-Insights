 Canadian investment management company Wealthsimple has tripled the insurance coverage it offers on client deposits to $300,000.  In a statement, the company said it is lifting the insurance it offers on all deposits above the $100,000 that is typically covered at Canadian banks and investment firms. The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), a federal Crown corporation, insures all Canadian bank deposits up to $100,000.  In the U.S., insurance coverage is provided on up to $250,000 of bank deposits.   Wealthsimpleâ€™s move to expand its deposit insurance protection comes after the collapse of several regional banks in the U.S., and as the company tries to attract new customers.  Toronto-based Wealthsimple was founded in 2014. Its assets under management have been estimated at $20 billion. Wealthsimple is a privately held company and its stock is not traded on a public exchange.  Copyright 1998 - 2024 Baystreet.ca Media Corp. All rights reserved.
