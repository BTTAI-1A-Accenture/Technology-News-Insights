  A man from Suffolk has told the story of how his Maine Coon kittens shot to internet stardom. 
 
  Daniel Wennam and his partner adopted Loki and Freya on Valentine’s Day this year. 
 
  Originally from America, Maine Coons are known for being “gentle giants.”
 
  They grow up to four times the size of regular domestic cats and are larger than many smaller breeds of dogs.

  Mr Wennam explained that he and his partner were tempted to adopt Loki and Freya because they knew of the breed’s playful and loving nature. 
 
  “Unlike normal domestic cats, these would happily sleep on your lap, or sneak their way into your bed at night for a snuggle,” he said. 
 
  “They can turn a bad day good, and I think everyone feels better after a snuggle with a cuddly cat!”

  He explained that owners will often treat Maine Coons like dogs, given their size. For their own safety and that of local wildlife, the cats are not allowed to roam free. Instead, Mr Wennam and his partner will take them for walks. 
 
  “We think everyone deserves a bit of outdoors,” he said.  
 
  “Unlike a dog where you take them for a walk on a desired route, Maine Coons tend to walk you, and so you lead them up for their own safety and just follow them where they want to explore until they are ready to come back inside – which is usually rather quickly!”

  Mr Wennam and his partner created an Instagram account for their cats, which has amassed over 3,000 followers in just one month. 
 
  “People are inquisitive to watch them grow due to their size, but equally as they are beautiful kittens, people also get a bit of a smile when seeing them play,” said Mr Wennam. 
 
  “In a world of bad news; Loki and Freya bring a bit of innocent fun to everybody, and I think that’s why they have become so popular.”
