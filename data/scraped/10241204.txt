Claim: A video that went viral in July 2023 authentically depicted an ad in Japan that read "Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War." Rating: Context: The video was posted in October 2020, before the Russian attack on Ukraine, and was digitally edited. ¬† In July 2023, a video went viral allegedly depicting a Japanese ad reading "'Stop Zelenskyy, Stop War." It had been posted on platforms such as Twitter, 9GAG, and TikTok, with captions that suggested the presence of anti-Ukrainian attitudes in Japan. Newsweek reported that the video was also shared by YouTuber¬†Jackson Hinkle who had over 243,000 followers at the time of this writing. üáØüáµüì¢Japan, advertising banner on the building: "Stop Zelensky!

It did not include an ad referring to the war in Ukraine; instead, it showed an ad featuring pictures of Japanese models.

Given that the video was captured before the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, and was digitally edited, we rate this claim as "Fake." Misleading footage on social media has often targeted the president of Ukraine. In June 2023, we debunked a fake image that¬†showed Zelenskyy in a T-shirt adorned with an illustration of human testicles. In March 2022, we fact-checked a false claim that Zelenskyy wore a Nazi symbol in public appearances in 2022. On the other hand, in June 2023, we confirmed that Volodymr Zelenskyy said in June 2023 that Ukraine would hold no elections until its war with Russia ends. 4K HDR„ÄëNight Walk in Tokyo Shibuya (Êù±‰∫¨Êï£Ê≠©).¬†www.youtube.com,¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nTO4zSEpOs" target="blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nTO4zSEpOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nTO4zSEpOs.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can‚Äôt seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked ‚ÄúAlien: Romulus‚Äù (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can‚Äôt escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood‚Äôs fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  ‚ÄúAlien: Romulus‚Äù tries to pull off a similar trick ‚Äî while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original ‚ÄúAlien,‚Äù it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020. iSeeCars' latest analysis found that a handful of models have a much greater chance of lasting 250,000 miles than others.
