Waiting for a great trade can take time. The wait is over for Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ADP as it is at a great buying point right now.  Here's why.  Going back to 2009, except for the quick "COVID" selloff in 2020, ADP is in a long-term rising channel. The price tends to fall 15% to 20% and then rally back to the highs of the channel.
The rallies back to the top of the channel have been 25% or much more, depending on how long the trade is held.

ADP is at the bottom of the channel right now, having recently fallen 20% from its December high ($274.92).
For a trade lasting two to six months, $275 to $290 is the price target. That’s 22% to 30% above the current price ($223.91). For a short-term trade, consider limiting the risk to 6% to 10% downside. That keeps the reward:risk attractive. For example, keep downside risk to 6% in order to make 20% or more. There is also the option to hold the stock for the long-term, and there is strong evidence to support that.
