Feedback The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) on Friday announced a few changes to the constituents of its major indices barring Nifty 50 and there's good news for those who own stocks of two Adani Group firms.  Adani Power and Adani Wilmar have been added to a few indices. Adani Wilmar has been included in Nifty Next 50 and Nifty 100 indices, whereas Adani Power will be part of Nifty 500, Nifty 200, Nifty Midcap 100, Nifty Midcap 150, Nifty LargeMidcap 250, and Nifty Midsmallcap 400 indices. All the changes in the indices will be effective from March 31, the exchange said. Apart from Adani Wilmar, ABB India, Canara Bank, Page Industries, Varun Beverages have been included in Nifty Next 50 index while Bandhan Bank, Biocon, Gland Pharma, Mphasis, Paytm have been excluded from this coveted index whose constituents can always make a case for being included in Nifty 50.  However, NSE didn't make any change to its Nifty 50 index as part of its periodic review. Opposition parties have been calling for exclusion of Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports from Nifty 50 ever since the conglomerate's stocks have been getting roiled after a scathing report by US short seller Hindenburg Research.
