Bloomfield Hills Restaurant MEX Reopens with New Look Following an extensive remodel, MEX, the Bloomfield Hills restaurant from Peas and Carrots Hospitality, recently reopened with a new look and a reinvented culinary program. The refresh, which comes after a successful decade in business, is designed to elevate the restaurantâs ambience and menu while still cooking up the Mexican-inspired classics that made it a local favorite. âWeâre fortunate that MEX has always been a beloved restaurant in the area,â says Zack Sklar, corporate executive chef and owner of Peas and Carrots Hospitality. âThe old concept was doing very well, but the remodel will offer a much bigger wowâ factor. âWe were a young company when MEX launched, and as with all restaurants, we grow â and grow up â over time. Our hospitality group has evolved, and we are heavily focused on elevating our concepts to evolve and meet the expectations and needs of our guests.â Sklar also spearheads MEXâs new culinary program. While some favorites â such as MEXâs steak, chicken, and shrimp fajitas as well as its freshly made salsa â will remain on the menu, guests can look forward to reimagined dishes including house-made tortillas, whole branzino, chorizo empanadas, duck-carnitas tacos, and vegan corn-coconut tamales. The beverage program, also revamped, features fresh-pressed lemon, lime and orange juice, signature cocktails mixed with white sangria, mojitos, and martinis, along with on-the-rocks and frozen margaritas. Located on the southeast corner of Maple and Telegraph roads, the nearly 7,000-square-foot-space has been refurbished from top to bottom, both inside and out. With the help of Bethesda, Md.-based design firm Streetsense, MEX has been transformed to a refined atmosphere that features warm earth tones, natural wood floors, sleek tile, and contemporary lighting fixtures throughout, and the expanded bar area includes a floor to ceiling glass enclosure. The new layout accommodates up to 220 seats, including 100 in the main dining room, up to 40 at the bar and up to 30 on the patio. The upstairs features a multi-use interchangeable space for regular dining service or private events with capacity for between 35-45 guests. For more information, visit mexbloomfield.com. Primitiv Group Collaborates with Detroit Native for New Cannabis Product Primitiv, the cannabis company owned by former Detroit Lions wide receiver and Pro Football Hall of Fame member Calvin Johnson and Rob Sims (who also played for the Lions), today announced its collaboration with Detroit native Adonis Williams to introduce High Grade MI Powered by Primitiv.

Each package contains 200mg of THC (10 gummies x 20mg THC per gummy). Williams has been making edibles and gummies over the past decade. He got his start in the Michigan cannabis community upon his return to Detroit following graduating from Florida A&M University.

Weâre looking forward to this launch and hopefully more collaborations down the road.â High Grade MI gummies currently are available in metro Detroit at Puff (Madison Heights), Quest (Whitmore Lake), Greenpharm (Hazel Park), Pleasantrees (Lake Orion), 315 North and Michiganâs Finest (Wayne), and Greenhouse of Walled Lake.
