Chemours has begun the search for Bellezza’s replacement with Joseph (Joe) Martinko, senior business director, Americas for TSS, stepping in as interim president. Martinko has over 30 years of experience in the chemical industry, more than 20 years of which were with Chemours TSS and Fluoroproducts businesses. His experience spans both global and regional leadership roles in which he delivered record-setting financial performance. Chemours president & CEO, Mark Newman, said Martinko’s deep knowledge of the portfolio and the company’s customer base is unmatched. “Combine that with his strong commercial experience and proven track record and I have every confidence he and the TSS team will continue building upon the strong first quarter results, ensuring clarity, consistency, and continued growth throughout this transition period,” Newman said. “Alisha has been a valued member of the Chemours executive team, and while we will miss her leadership and drive, we wish her all the best in the next phase of her career. The TSS business has a solid foundation upon which we will continue to build. “We also have an industry leading product portfolio, an exciting innovation pipeline, and a highly capable and dedicated team that knows how to win. All of this ensures that we are well-positioned for continued growth, even in the face of changes. I have every confidence in our TSS team’s ability to continue executing our strategy and delivering strong business results.” Newsletter Signup Sign-up to receive weekly updates and the latest HVACR news in our email newsletter.
