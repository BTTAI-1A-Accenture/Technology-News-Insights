Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) in its Q4 2022 investor letter: “Let’s look at Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST). Its dividend yield is 0.8%. Earnings over the next 3-5 years are forecasted to grow at ~10%. The current P/E multiple is a very pricey 34x for such growth rate. Now, Costco is an outstanding business with consistent profits and cash flows. However, the price that you pay is important (and you tend to pay a very high price for a “cheery consensus”) and if the earnings multiple comes down to say 30x, you internal rate of return (IRR) over the next 4-5 years will be around 6-7% from holding Costco’s stock. Its a decent market-like return, but nothing to be excited about (only a few percentage points over risk-free rate).” omar-abascal-9Um7Huux0as-unsplash Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.
