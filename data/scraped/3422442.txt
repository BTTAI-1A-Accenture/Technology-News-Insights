 Writer, Consultant  KEY POINTS Did you know that veterans own almost 2 million small businesses that generate an impressive $1.3 trillion annually? In fact, veterans are 45% more likely than non-veterans to start their own businesses. However, starting a business can be daunting, especially for veterans transitioning to civilian life. Fortunately, there are many grants available to provide financial support for veteran-owned businesses, covering everything from startup costs to salaries. The Second Service Foundation, formerly the StreetShares Foundation, helps military veteran and military spouse entrepreneurs looking to start or grow a business venture. One of the grants offered is the Military Entrepreneur Challenge, a three-part event led by the Foundation. The event includes a speed coaching session, private pitch session to a judging panel, and an opportunity to pitch business ideas to a live audience for a chance to win a small business grant. In addition to grant money, the winners also receive access to training and mentoring programs from the Second Service Foundation, Brewing the American Dream, and the U.S. Small Business Administration.


 Grant amount: Regular season: up to $2,000; national pitch competition: up to $15,000 What you need to qualify: Deadline to apply: You must register and attend speed coaching to be eligible to participate in the pitch competition. Registration numbers are limited based on venue and events are held frequently across the country.
