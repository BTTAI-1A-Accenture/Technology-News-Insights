Editions: En/lifestyle/celebrity-net-worth Mas, now with Messi on his team, will continue to be one of the most prominent businessmen in the United States. Jorge Mas, principal owner of Inter Miami, dropped the bomb of the soccer market after announcing the one and only Lionel Messi as the club's new superstar. The Cuban American businessmen will be in the spotlight along the Argentinian star during the next weeks, and his net income may just keep rising with everyone wanting to purchase a ticket to see Messi or a jersey with the number 10 on it. According to Forbes, Jorge Mas net worth before Lionel Messi's announcement was $1.3 billion. After the signing of the current FIFA World Cup champion, his fortune elevated to $1.4 billion. Mas is the chairman of MasTec, which is an infrastructure engineering and construction company that started with his father, Jorge Mas Canosa. His father arrived to Florida in 1960, seeking for a new home, after exiting Cuba as a firm opponent of Fidel Castro.  He initiated Church & Tower, which was a company responsible for cables and installing telephone poles. In 1984, it transformed into MasTec and turned into a multinational construction firm that also provides maintenance for energy. Nowadays, MasTec is valued at about $9.8 billion and is basically one of the largest Hispanic-owned firms in the United States. Besides Inter Miami and MasTec, Jorge Mas also co-founded Neff Rentals another construction company that he managed to sell for $510 million back on 2005.  After acquiring the majority of Inter Miami, and stablishing a deal with former soccer star David Beckham, Mas shared his vision. "The dream is making Miami the gateway for soccer, not only in South Florida but in the Americas", he said. And now, with one of the greatest football players ever, he's one step closer to make his dream come true. ©  Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us
