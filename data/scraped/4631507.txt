Published on By Flutterwave, Africa’s largest fintech company, has revealed its plans to revamp one of its retail offerings, Barter. The platform provides money transfer and virtual card services to Flutterwave customers. The decision to rebuild Barter was for improved efficiency and a better user experience, the firm explained in an email on January 31. “The company’s product team is hard at work creating an entirely new version with more benefits,” it noted. The updated design will tackle customer issues by breaking down its current services and addressing specific problems. While Barter undergoes maintenance, certain features such as new user sign-up and barter-to-barter transfers may be impacted. However, customers will still be able to withdraw funds and pay bills and airtime. “Flutterwave recommends using Send by Flutterwave for cross-border fund transfers,” the communication added.
