Menu PHOENIX — More than 150 flights were delayed at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Monday. According to the airport's website, more than 100 flights were delayed around 2 p.m. The Federal Aviation Administration says departures out of Phoenix are grounded due to "other." That ground stop has since been lifted. According to Flight Aware, 72 Southwest Airlines flights were delayed to or from Sky Harbor at one point while 82 American Airlines flights were delayed. An exact reason for the ground stop hasn't been revealed. However, the FAA says its Albuquerque Center in New Mexico "had a telecommunications issue which affected Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport." A representative with Southwest Airlines released the following statement: We worked with the FAA for a few minutes this afternoon to sequence our inbound flights at Sky Harbor to minimize the chance that any aircraft would be holding out for a gate to open up, or would have a long taxi out for takeoff, ever-mindful of heat in these operating conditions. 9 out of 10 Southwest flights arriving into Phoenix today are on time. Monday's forecast high in Phoenix was 115º. On Tuesday morning, dozens of flight delays were still reported, though it's unclear if the delays were scheduling backups or otherwise connected to Monday's delays. Report a typo
