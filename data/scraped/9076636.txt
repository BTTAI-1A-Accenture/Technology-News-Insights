Publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment and developer Guerrilla Games have opened PlayStation Store pre-orders for Horizon Forbidden West downloadable content “Burning Shores,” which is due out for PlayStation 5 on April 19 for $19.99.  Pre-orders for “Burning Shores” include the in-game items “Blacktide Dye Outfit” and “Blacktide Sharpshot Bow.” Here is an overview of the downloadable content, via PlayStation Store: South of the Tenakth Clan Lands, a millennia of volcanic eruptions and violent seismic activity has carved the ruins of Los Angeles into a treacherous archipelago. Experience the next chapter of Horizon Forbidden West, as Aloy pursues a sinister new threat to the planet, hidden among these dangerous, untamed wilds. “The Burning Shores” contains additional content for Horizon Forbidden West, including new storylines, characters, and experiences in a stunning yet hazardous new area. To enter the Burning Shores, you must complete the main quest (up to and including Singularity) in the PlayStation 5 version of Horizon Forbidden West—following the main quest, the player will receive a call over Aloy’s Focus, beginning the downloadable content. Horizon Forbidden West is available now for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Watch the pre-order trailer below.
