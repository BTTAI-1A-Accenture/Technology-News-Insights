Metadata is the information that describes, categorizes, and organizes your documents. It can include details such as title, author, date, keywords, format, source, and more. Metadata helps you find, manage, and share your documents more efficiently and effectively. But how do you ensure that your metadata is consistent and accurate across different document types and sources? Here are some tips to help you improve your document management metadata.
 
The first step is to define your metadata standards and requirements for your document types and sources. This means identifying what metadata elements are mandatory, optional, or conditional, and how they should be formatted, validated, and controlled. For example, you may have different metadata standards for PDFs, Word documents, images, and web pages. You may also have different metadata standards for internal and external documents, or for different departments or projects. Having clear and consistent metadata standards will help you avoid errors, confusion, and duplication.

            Develop a style guide that identifies the metadata you need to populate.

In the end, many documents will be coded incorrectly. You won't be able to fix everything. but you'll at least be able to get it mostly right.

            Define the requirements and seek to automate it as much as possible. Many document scanners provide the capability to provide metadata with the image (as long as you configure it in the appropriate way)... you can even include content extracted from the document such as barcode information or zonal OCR. Think it through carefully and automate as much of it as possible, people are great but they have more bad days than technology.

            Para definir y gestionar estándares de metadatos en documentos, la norma ISO 15489 es fundamental. Esta norma, que trata sobre la gestión de documentos y la documentación, establece principios y directrices para la creación y gestión de metadatos. Además, la ISO 23081 complementa esta gestión al proporcionar un esquema para la gestión de metadatos en sistemas de información documental. Aplicar estas normas ayuda a estandarizar los metadatos, garantizar la integridad de la información y facilitar la interoperabilidad entre sistemas, evitando errores y mejorando la eficiencia en el manejo de documentos. 
Next, use metadata tools and automation to help you create, capture, and update your metadata. This can include using templates, forms, macros, scripts, or software that can automatically generate or extract metadata from your documents or sources. For example, you can use a template that has predefined metadata fields and values, or a software that can read the metadata from the file properties or the content. You can also use automation to check, correct, or enhance your metadata based on rules or criteria. This will help you save time, reduce manual work, and ensure accuracy and consistency.

            Validation against rules or existing data is invaluable in ensuring data accuracy. Whilst creating a simple capture and manual index process may expedite starting to use a document management platform, it is always worth taking the time to design full index validation. If you cannot locate a document due to 'bad' index (metadata) values then it loses it value to the organisation.

Some consultants advocate simply dumping document content into a repository and allowing full text routines to create a searchable index, however, this does not allow for optimised user, role, department security or the implementation of index based process automation (such as retention).

            Usar herramientas colaborativas puede transformar la gestión documental, haciéndola más eficiente y precisa. Las plantillas y software especializados facilitan la creación y actualización de metadatos, reduciendo el riesgo de errores y liberando tiempo para tareas más estratégicas. La automatización, a través de scripts y macros, no solo mejora la precisión al aplicar reglas consistentes, sino que también asegura que los metadatos se mantengan actualizados y coherentes en todos los documentos. Esta integración tecnológica no solo optimiza los procesos, sino que también garantiza una gestión más organizada y efectiva de la información. 
You will also have to implement metadata governance and quality control to ensure that your metadata is compliant, reliable, and up to date. This means establishing roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures for managing your metadata lifecycle. For example, you may have a metadata owner, a metadata editor, a metadata reviewer, and a metadata auditor. You may also have a metadata policy that defines the purpose, scope, standards, and best practices for your metadata. You may also have a metadata quality control process that involves regular audits, reviews, feedback, and improvement actions. This will help you maintain metadata integrity, security, and usability.

            Before importing data into a database it is vital to map the new data’s metadata fields against pre-existing fields in the database so that you aren’t creating duplicative fields that will make review more difficult. For instance, if your database has a “Doc Type” field, you’ll want to review the new data for any field that resembles “Doc Type”, like “Document Type” or “File Type”. Of course, you’ll want to review the contents of these fields to ensure they translate well, but field mapping in this way cuts down review time and makes searching more accurate and responsive.

            Implementar este tipo de procesos es esencial para asegurar que la información sea precisa y confiable. Definir roles claros, como propietarios y auditores de metadatos, establece una estructura de responsabilidad que garantiza que los metadatos se gestionen con rigor. Establecer políticas y procedimientos bien definidos asegura la consistencia y la alineación con los estándares de calidad. Las auditorías regulares y las revisiones continuas son cruciales para detectar y corregir problemas antes de que afecten la integridad de los datos. Este enfoque integral no solo protege la precisión y la seguridad de los metadatos, sino que también facilita su uso efectivo y confiable en toda la organización.

            Always have SME and project coordinator review 
A collaboration team is vital when setting up new system (using Teams library for example) 
Documenting and communicating your metadata strategy to your stakeholders and users is also a key step. This means creating and sharing documentation that explains your metadata standards, tools, governance, and quality control. For example, you may have a metadata guide, a metadata dictionary, a metadata training manual, or a metadata FAQ. You may also have a metadata communication plan that defines how, when, and to whom you will communicate your metadata updates, changes, or issues. This will help you increase metadata awareness, understanding, and adoption.

            I think this is a mandatory. From an internal process view, from an audit process perspective and actually if you aspire to an ISO standard i would recommend this too. 
Now, monitor and evaluate your metadata performance to measure its impact and value. This means collecting and analyzing data and feedback on how your metadata is used, accessed, and searched. For example, you may use metrics such as metadata completeness, accuracy, consistency, relevance, and timeliness. You may also use surveys, interviews, or focus groups to gather feedback from your metadata users and stakeholders. This will help you identify metadata strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges.
  With the help of M-Files’ AI technologies, metadata is automatically created, defined, and contextualized. Users can access all their data and content through a single interface, encompassing e-discovery, records management, auto-classification, and archiving for proper disposition, allowing them to extract the most benefit from unstructured data and work more effectively with regulators.

Users do not have to take any extra steps. Based on the metadata that already exists, M-Files AI learns completely behind the scenes. As a result, information management systems can reduce data entry errors, enforce consistency in information and metadata tags, and even manage workflows. The more it is used, the more intelligent it becomes. 
Lastly, update and improve your metadata continuously to keep it aligned with your document management goals and needs. This means reviewing and revising your metadata standards, tools, governance, quality control, strategy, and performance periodically or as needed. For example, you may need to update your metadata to reflect new document types, sources, formats, or requirements. You may also need to improve your metadata to address new user needs, preferences, or expectations. This will help you ensure that your metadata is always relevant, useful, and effective.
