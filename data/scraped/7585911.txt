Being a multi-sport athlete in college isn’t uncommon, but it does come with a lot of pressure, especially when key games land on the same day.  Just ask University of Central Florida’s John Rhys Plumlee, who had to rush from the baseball field to the football field this past weekend.  But he wouldn’t change it for the world.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM John Rhys Plumlee of Central Florida during an NCAA college basketball game against Siena, Sunday, Feb. 19, 2023, in Orlando, Fla.

"I’m super, super thankful and blessed to be able to do what I do and be able to have the fun that I’m able to have. This is a movie for me. This is a dream for me. Second-grad John Rhys dreamed about this day for a long time." Plumlee went 2-for-3 with a triple and two RBI during Friday’s 12-3 win for the UCF Knights over Memphis, but he was taken out of the game in the seventh inning to rush over to the football locker room.

He rushed through his changing, getting some help with the pads, and he was on the Knights’ football sideline seven minutes after leaving the baseball field.  "I think it has to be a world record," Plumlee said, via AP.  John Rhys Plumlee #10 of the UCF Knights drops back to pass against the Duke Blue Devils in the Military Bowl Presented by Peraton  at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium on December 28, 2022 in Annapolis, Maryland.

While he was able to play football in 2022, he missed a deadline for baseball.  But he’s in the fold this year, which made head football coach Gus Malzahn and head baseball coach Greg Lovelady figure out a schedule they were both happy with for Plumlee.  Last season on the football field for the Knights, Plumlee threw for 2,586 yards with 14 touchdowns to eight interceptions, while rushing for 862 yards with 11 touchdowns. The Knights went 9-5 overall, which led to a bowl appearance.  John Rhys Plumlee #10 of the UCF Knights walks back to the locker room after defeating the Cincinnati Bearcats 25-21 at FBC Mortgage Stadium on October 29, 2022 in Orlando, Florida.
