 ESET researchers have uncovered a Lazarus attack against an aerospace company in Spain, where the group deployed several tools, most notably a publicly undocumented backdoor we named LightlessCan. Lazarus operators obtained initial access to the company’s network last year after a successful spearphishing campaign, masquerading as a recruiter for Meta – the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The fake recruiter contacted the victim via LinkedIn Messaging, a feature within the LinkedIn professional social networking platform, and sent two coding challenges required as part of a hiring process, which the victim downloaded and executed on a company device. The first challenge is a very basic project that displays the text “Hello, World!”, the second one prints a Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. ESET Research was able to reconstruct the initial access steps and analyze the toolset used by Lazarus thanks to cooperation with the affected aerospace company. In this blogpost, we describe the method of infiltration and the tools deployed during this Lazarus attack. We will also present some of our findings about this attack at the Virus Bulletin conference on October 4, 2023. Key points of the blogpost: Lazarus delivered various payloads to the victims’ systems; the most notable is a publicly undocumented and sophisticated remote access trojan (RAT) that we named LightlessCan, which represents a significant advancement compared to its predecessor, BlindingCan. LightlessCan mimics the functionalities of a wide range of native Windows commands, enabling discreet execution within the RAT itself instead of noisy console executions. This strategic shift enhances stealthiness, making detecting and analyzing the attacker’s activities more challenging. Another mechanism used to minimize exposure is the employment of execution guardrails; Lazarus made sure the payload can only be decrypted on the intended victim’s machine. Execution guardrails are a set of protective protocols and mechanisms implemented to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of the payload during its deployment and execution, effectively preventing unauthorized decryption on unintended machines, such as those of security researchers. We describe the implementation of this mechanism in the Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version) section. The Lazarus group (also known as HIDDEN COBRA) is a cyberespionage group linked to North Korea that has been active since at least 2009. It is responsible for high-profile incidents such as both the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-dollar cyberheists in 2016, the WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, the 3CX and X_TRADER supply-chain attacks, and a long history of disruptive attacks against South Korean public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011. The diversity, number, and eccentricity in implementation of Lazarus campaigns define this group, as well as that it performs all three pillars of cybercriminal activities: cyberespionage, cybersabotage, and pursuit of financial gain. Aerospace companies are not an unusual target for North Korea-aligned advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The country has conducted multiple nuclear tests and launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, which violate United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions. The UN monitors North Korea’s nuclear activities to prevent further development and proliferation of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, and publishes biannual reports tracking such activities. According to these reports, North Korea-aligned APT groups attack aerospace companies in attempts to access sensitive technology and aerospace know-how, as intercontinental ballistic missiles spend their midcourse phase in the space outside of Earth’s atmosphere. These reports also claim that money gained from cyberattacks accounts for a portion of North Korea’s missile development costs. We attribute the attack in Spain to the Lazarus group, specifically to Operation DreamJob, with a high level of confidence. The name for Operation DreamJob was coined in a blogpost by ClearSky from August 2020, describing a Lazarus campaign targeting defense and aerospace companies, with the objective of cyberespionage. Since then, we have loosely used the term to denote various Lazarus operations leveraging job-offering lures but not deploying tools clearly similar to those involved in its other activities, such as Operation In(ter)ception. For example, the campaign involving tools signed with 2 TOY GUYS certificates (see ESET Threat Report T1 2021, page 11), and the case of Amazon-themed lures in the Netherlands and Belgium published in September 2022. Our attribution is based on the following factors, which show a relationship mostly with the previously mentioned Amazon-themed campaign: 1. Malware (the intrusion set): 2. Infrastructure: 3. Cui bono: The group targeted multiple company employees via LinkedIn Messaging. Masquerading as a Meta recruiter, the attacker used a job offer lure to attract the target’s attention and trust; a screenshot of this conversation, which we obtained during our cooperation with the Spanish aerospace company, is depicted in Figure 1. At the beginning of Lazarus attacks, the unaware targets are usually convinced to recklessly self-compromise their systems. For this purpose, the attackers employ different strategies; for example, the target is lured to execute an attacker-provided (and trojanized) PDF viewer to see the full content of a job offer. Alternately, the target is encouraged to connect with a trojanized SSL/VPN client, being provided with an IP address and login details. Both scenarios are described in a Microsoft blogpost published in September 2022. The narrative in this case was the scammer’s request to prove the victim’s proficiency in the C++ programming language. Two malicious executables, Quiz1.exe and Quiz2.exe, were provided for that purpose and delivered via the Quiz1.iso and Quiz2.iso images hosted on a third-party cloud storage platform. Both executables are very simple command line applications asking for input. The first one is a Hello World project, which is a very basic program, often consisting of just a single line of code, that displays the text “Hello, World!” when executed. The second prints a Fibonacci sequence up to the largest element smaller than the number entered as input. A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1; however, in this malicious challenge, the sequence starts with 1 and 2. Figure 2 displays example output from the Fibonacci sequence challenge. After the output is printed, both executables trigger the malicious action of installing additional payloads from the ISO images onto the target’s system. The task for a targeted developer is to understand the logic of the program and rewrite it in the C++ programming language. The chain of events that led to the initial compromise is sketched in Figure 3. The first payload delivered to the target’s system is an HTTP(S) downloader that we have named NickelLoader. The tool allows the attackers to deploy any desired program into the memory of the victim’s computer. Once NickelLoader is running on the target’s system, the attackers use it to deliver two types of RATs. One of these RATs is already known to be part of the Lazarus toolkit, specifically a variant of the BlindingCan backdoor with limited functionality but identical command processing logic. To distinguish it, we put the prefix mini- in front of the variant’s name. Additionally, the attackers introduced a RAT not previously undocumented publicly, which we have named LightlessCan. The RATs are deployed as the final step of chains of stages with varying levels of complexity and are preceded by helper executables, like droppers and loaders. We denote an executable as a dropper if it contains an embedded payload, even if it’s not dropped onto the file system but instead loaded directly into memory and executed. Malware that doesn’t have an encrypted embedded data array, but that loads a payload from the file system, we denote as a loader. Besides the initial quiz-related lures, Table 1 summarizes the executable files (EXEs) and dynamic link libraries (DLLs) delivered to the victim’s system. All the malware samples in the third column are trojanized open-source applications (see the fourth column for the underlying project), with a legitimate executable side-loading a malicious DLL. For example, the malicious mscoree.dll is a trojanized version of the legitimate NppyPluginDll; the DLL contains an embedded NickelLoader and is loaded by a legitimate PresentationHost.exe, both located in the C:\ProgramShared directory.

LightlessCan is a new complex RAT that has support for up to 68 distinct commands, indexed in a custom function table, but in the current version, 1.0, only 43 of those commands are implemented with some functionality. The remaining commands are present but have a formal implementation in the form of placeholders, lacking actual functionality. The project behind the RAT is definitely based on the BlindingCan source code, as the order of the shared commands is preserved significantly, even though there may be differences in their indexing. The most significant update is mimicked functionality of many native Windows commands like ping, ipconfig, systeminfo, sc, net, etc. The hardcoded string “The operation completed successfully.”, the standard system message for the ERROR_SUCCESS result, brought us to that idea. Table 2 contains a list of those commands that are implemented in LightlessCan. In previously reported Lazarus attacks, as documented in blogposts by Positive Technologies in April 2021 and HvS Consulting in December 2020, these native commands are often executed in many instances after the attackers have gotten a foothold in the target’s system. However, in this case, these commands are executed discreetly within the RAT itself, rather than being executed visibly in the system console. This approach offers a significant advantage in terms of stealthiness, both in evading real-time monitoring solutions like EDRs, and postmortem digital forensic tools. The internal version number (1.0) indicates that this represents a new development effort by the attackers. As the core utilities of Windows are proprietary and not open-source, the developers of LightlessCan faced a choice: either to reverse engineer the closed-source system binaries or to get inspired by the code available via the Wine project, where many programs are rewritten in order to mimic their execution on other platforms like Linux, macOS, or ChromeOS. We are inclined to believe the developers chose the first option, as the corresponding Wine programs they mimicked in LightlessCan were implemented a little bit differently or not at all (e.g., netsh). Interestingly, in one of the cases we analyzed, the LightlessCan payload is stored in an encrypted file on the compromised machine, which can only be decrypted using an environment-dependent key. More details about this can be found in the Execution chain 3: LightlessCan (complex version) section. This is to ensure that the payload can only be decrypted on the computer of the intended victim and not, for example, on a device of a security researcher. Table 2.

Furthermore, an examination of the RAT’s internal configuration suggests that, in comparison to BlindingCan, Lazarus increased the code sophistication in LightlessCan. In this section, we provide technical details about the compromise chain that delivers the NickelLoader downloader, and the three execution chains Lazarus used to deliver its payloads on the compromised system. NickelLoader is an HTTP(S) downloader executed on the compromised system via DLL side-loading, which is later used to deliver other Lazarus payloads. The process of delivering NickelLoader unfolds in a series of stages, commencing with the execution of PresentationHost.exe, which is triggered automatically after the target manually executes the initial quiz challenges; the Quiz1 case is depicted in Figure 3. A malicious dynamically linked library, mscoree.dll, is then side-loaded by the legitimate PresentationHost.exe – both located in C:\ProgramShared\. This DLL is a trojanized NppyPluginDll.dll, from the inactive General Python Plugins DLL for Notepad++ project from 2011. It serves as a dropper and has various exports: all the exports copied from the original NppyPluginDll.dll plus all the exports from the legitimate mscoree.dll. One of these legitimate exports, CorExitProcess, contains the malicious code responsible for the decryption and execution of the next malware stage. To successfully decrypt an encrypted data array embedded in the dropper, three 16-character-long keywords are required by the dropper. These keywords are as follows: The keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms the AES-128 decryption key. The payload is an HTTP(S) downloader that recognizes four commands, all five letters long, shown in Table 3. Because of those five letter commands, we chose to name this payload “NickelLoader”, drawing inspiration from the colloquial term for the US five-cent coin – a nickel. The most important commands are avdrq and gabnc. When these commands are issued, each of them loads data received from the C&C server as a DLL. For this purpose, the attackers probably used MemoryModule, a library that can be used to load a DLL completely from memory. Table 3. The list of magic keywords recognized in received buffers

 Keyword Description abcde Requests another immediate command without the usual long sleep delay that separates the execution of the commands. avdrq Loads a DLL contained in the received buffer and executes its hardcoded export info. gabnc Loads a DLL contained in the received buffer. dcrqv One of the payloads downloaded and executed by NickelLoader is miniBlindingCan, a simplified version of the group’s flagship BlindingCan RAT. It was reported for the first time by Mandiant in September 2022, under the name AIRDRY.V2. To load miniBlindingCan, a 64-bit malicious dynamically linked library colorui.dll is side-loaded by a legitimate colorcpl.exe executed from C:\ProgramData\Adobe\ and serves as a dropper. The DLL is obfuscated using VMProtect and contains thousands of exports from which LaunchColorCpl is the most important, as it handles the execution of the next stage. There’s an encrypted data array in the DLL’s dumped body, together with multiple debug symbols revealing the root directory and the project from which it was built: W:\Develop\aTool\ShellCodeLoader\App\libressl-2.6.5\ As the name ShellCodeLoader suggests, the main purpose of this initial stage is to decrypt and load the data array from its body, which contains shellcode. At the beginning of its execution, ShellCodeLoader employs anti-debugging techniques by inspecting the BeingDebugged value within the Process Environment Block (PEB) structure to determine if it’s being scrutinized or analyzed by debugging tools, and utilizes anti-sandbox techniques to avoid detection within sandboxed environments designed for security analysis. The malware also explicitly checks whether its parent process is colorcpl.exe; if not, it exits immediately. The decrypted data array is not a complete DLL, but forms an intermediate blob with two parts: shellcode followed by another encrypted data array, which represents the last step of the chain. The shellcode seems to be produced by an instance of the open-source project ShellcodeRDI – in particular, the ShellcodeRDI.c code. It was probably produced by executing the Python script ConvertToShellcode.py from this project on a payload DLL acting as a source for reflective DLL injection. The final payload is extracted and decrypted using XOR with a long key, which is a string built by concatenating the name of the parent process (colorcpl.exe), the filename of the dropper (colorui.dll), and the external command line parameter – in this case resulting in COLORCPL.EXECOLORUI.DLL669498484488D3F22712CC5BACA6B7A7. This process is akin to what we observed with BlindingCan backdoor in the Dutch case we previously described in this WeLiveSecurity blogpost. The decryption reveals an executable with download-and-execute functionality, whose internal logic of sending and parsing commands is strongly reminiscent of BlindingCan, a flagship HTTP(S) Lazarus RAT. Unlike the case in the Netherlands, it is not VMProtect-ed and it supports only a small subset of commands available previously: compare Table 4in this blogpost and Table 3 in the blogpost on the Dutch case from September 2022. Because the features of this RAT are notably scaled down compared to those in BlindingCan, and yet they seem to share the same server-side infrastructure, we have chosen to distinguish it by appending the prefix “mini-“ to its name, highlighting its reduced functionality compared to its fully-featured RAT counterpart.

 Command ID  Description 8201 Send system information like computer name, Windows version, and code page. 8232 Update the current communication interval with a value provided by the C&C server. 8233 Discontinue the command execution. 8241 Send the current configuration of size 9,392 bytes to the C&C server. 8242 Update the configuration of size 9,392 bytes, stored encrypted on the file system. 8247 Wait for the next command. 8248 Update the current communication interval with a value stored in the configuration. 8274 Download and decrypt a file from the C&C server. 8279 Execute shellcode passed as a parameter. Figure 11 shows the decrypted state of a 9,392-byte-long configuration embedded in the RAT. It contains five URLs, in this case compromised websites, each limited by a maximum size of 260 wide characters. Another payload we have seen executed by NickelLoader is LightlessCan, a new Lazarus backdoor. We have observed two different chains loading this backdoor. In the simple version of the chain, the dropper of this payload is the malicious dynamically linked library mapistub.dll that is side-loaded by the legitimate fixmapi.exe executed from C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\. The DLL is a trojanized Lua plugin, version 1.4, with all the exports copied from the legitimate Windows mapi32.dll. The export FixMAPI contains malicious code responsible for decrypting and loading the next stage; all the other exports contain benign code sourced from a publicly available MineSweeper sample project. This mapistub.dll dropper has persistence established via a scheduled task. Unfortunately, we lack additional details about this task, except that its parent process appears as %WINDOWS%\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Schedule. To successfully decrypt the embedded data array, the dropper needs three keywords to be provided correctly: The keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms a 128-bit AES key to be used for decryption. Note that the length of the keywords are not all exactly 16 bytes, but the decryption process will still work if the oversized string is truncated to a 16-byte length (for instance, AudioEndpointBuilder to AudioEndpointBui), and the undersized string, fixmapi.exe, is treated as fixmapi.exe\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00, because the string was initialized as 260 instances of the NUL character. The most complex chain we observed on the compromised system also delivers LightlessCan, with various components involved in the complete chain of installation stages: a legitimate application, an initial dropper, a complete dropper (which contains the configuration), an intermediate dropper, a configuration file, a file with system information (for the decryption of encrypted payloads on the file system), an intermediate loader and the final step, the LightlessCan RAT. The connections and relationships among these files are illustrated in Figure 12. The initial dropper of the fourth chain is a malicious dynamically linked library HID.dll that is side-loaded by a legitimate executable, tabcal.exe, executed from C:\ProgramData\Adobe\ARM\. The DLL is a trojanized version of MZC8051.dll, a legitimate file from the 8051 C compiler plugin project for Notepad++. It contains all the exports from the original project, but also the necessary exports from the legitimate Hid User Library by Microsoft, so that the side-loading by tabcal.exe will be successful. The export HidD_GetHidGuid contains the malicious code responsible for dropping the next stage and, as in the case of the dropper of the previous chain (Execution chain 2), all the other exports contain the benign MineSweeper code. As in the previous cases, three long keywords must be provided to decrypt the embedded payload: Again, the keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte and the output forms a 128-bit AES key to be used for the decryption. As in the previous case, the lengths of the keywords are not all exactly 16 bytes, but the decryption will still work if the oversized string is truncated (for instance, to LocalServiceNetw) and the undersized string is extended with nulls (for instance, to tabcal.exe\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00). The executable produced by the above recipe is the complete dropper from Figure 12 and has the InternalName resource AppResolver.dll (found in the VERSIONINFO resource). It contains two encrypted data arrays: a small one of 126 bytes, and a large one of 1,807,464 bytes (which contains three subparts). First, it decrypts the small array using the RC6 algorithm with the hardcoded 256-bit key DA 48 A3 14 8D BF E2 D2 EF 91 12 11 FF 75 59 A3 E1 6E A0 64 B8 78 89 77 A0 37 91 58 5A FF FF 07. The output represents paths to which the first two subparts of the large blob are dropped (i.e., LightlessCan and the intermediate dropper), and yields the strings C:\windows\system32\oci.dll and C:\windows\system32\grpedit.dat. Next, it continues with decrypting the second data array – the large blob – using the same encryption key as before. The result is a decrypted blob containing three subparts: a DLL corresponding to grpedit.dat (LightlessCan), a DLL corresponding to oci.dll (the intermediate dropper), and a 14,948 byte encrypted file dropped to %WINDOWS%\System32\wlansvc.cpl (configuration); as depicted in Figure 13. Moreover, the complete dropper also stores several characteristics identifying the compromised system in the file %WINDOWS%\System32\4F59FB87DF2F, whose name is hardcoded in the binary. These characteristics are primarily retrieved from the Computer\HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\BIOS registry path. Here are the specific values of these characteristics, along with a PowerShell command provided in brackets that can be used to display the corresponding value on any Windows machine: The concatenation of the values is required for decryption of the encrypted grpedit.dat from the file system. On a test machine running an image of Windows 10 on VMWare, the output can be: 11/12/20INTEL - 6040000VMware, Inc.VMware Virtual Platform656ba047-20b25a2a-A The oci.dll file is another dropping layer – the intermediate dropper that drops the intermediate loader, which is a payload similar to the one described in the previously mentioned Dutch case. Again, the attackers used an open-source project, the Flashing Tip plugin for Notepad++, which is no longer available online. Unlike the previous cases, only two long keywords must be provided in order to decrypt the embedded payload successfully using AES-128: Both keywords are XOR-ed byte by byte (the parent process name is truncated, or padded with NULLs, as necessary to fill 16 bytes). The product of the decryption is the intermediate loader (LLTMapperAPI.dll). It uses the system information (same as the values stored in 4F59FB87DF2F) to decrypt the configuration file wlansvc.cpl and to locate, decrypt, and load the encrypted grpedit.dat, which is LightlessCan, the new full-featured RAT. We have described a new Lazarus attack that originated on LinkedIn where fake recruiters approached their potential victims, who were using corporate computers for personal purposes. Even though public awareness of these types of attacks should be high, the success rates of these campaigns have still not dropped to zero. The most worrying aspect of the attack is the new type of payload, LightlessCan, a complex and possibly evolving tool that exhibits a high level of sophistication in its design and operation, representing a significant advancement in malicious capabilities compared to its predecessor, BlindingCan. The attackers can now significantly limit the execution traces of their favorite Windows command line programs that are heavily used in their post-compromise activity. This maneuver has far-reaching implications, impacting the effectiveness of both real-time monitoring solutions and of post-mortem digital forensic tools.
