  At the IFA 2017 conference in Berlin today, Microsoft announced that the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will be available for PCs on October 17. To coincide with that, the firm also said that Windows Mixed Reality head-mounted displays (HMDs) will be available on the same date. There's already been quite a bit of Windows Mixed Reality news to come out of IFA, with ASUS, Dell, and Lenovo unveiling their HMDs, but none of these companies actually provided a specific launch date. Lenovo said that its Explorer will be available in October, Dell said that its Visor will be available in the coming months, and ASUS' creatively named Windows Mixed Reality Headset won't be on shelves until the spring. Dell's Visor is the only one so far that's confirmed to be coming on October 17, but the rest of them (with the exception of the ASUS one) are going to be available before the holiday season. Of course, Acer's and HP's Windows Mixed Reality Headset Developer Edition HMDs have been available since the beginning of August, with pre-orders starting back in May. All of these devices have different designs with similar specs and requirements. They all have two 1440x1440 displays, and you'll be able to run them off of a PC with integrated graphics at 60fps, or off of a PC with discrete graphics at 90fps. Microsoft first announced its plans to build virtual reality headsets with these five partners last October. With a starting price of $299 and the ability to run off of integrated graphics, they provide a lower barrier to entry than competitors from Oculus and HTC. Update: HP has also confirmed that its Windows Mixed Reality headset will go on sale on October 17, bundled with two Motion Controllers for $449.
