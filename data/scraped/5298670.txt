Whole Foods Market temporarily closed its flagship downtown San Francisco store, which opened a little over a year ago, due to safety concerns. The store closed Monday and remained shuttered as of this morning, a Whole Foods Market spokesperson confirmed in an email Tuesday.   "To ensure the safety of our Team Members, we have made the difficult decision to close the Trinity store for the time being," a Whole Foods Market spokesperson said in a written statement. "All Team Members will be transferred to one of our nearby locations." Whole Foods Market opened its flagship San Francisco store, located in the Mid-Market neighborhood, in March 2022, selling more than 3,700 local products, according to the company.  San Francisco Board of Supervisors member Matt Dorsey tweeted Monday that he was "incredibly disappointed but sadly unsurprised" by the temporary closure, blaming crime and announcing a potential measure to re-establish minimum police staffing levels.  Reviewed:How Amazon delivers grocery deals with Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Groceries Recall alert:Premade salads, lettuce products recalled over possible Listeria contamination, health risks The recent stabbing death of CashApp founder Bob Lee in downtown San Francisco has heightened concerns over crime in the city.  Violent crimes in San Francisco, such as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, reached a high of 7,164 incidents in 2013. But the rate has declined in recent years, down to 4,966 violent crimes in 2021, according to the California Department of Justice.  Property crimes, meanwhile, have increased in recent years, but remain below a 2017 peak, according to San Francisco Police Department data.
