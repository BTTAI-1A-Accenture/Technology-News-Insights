     Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A dog received plastic surgery after his saggy eyes were causing him to have issues with his vision. Chief is a three-year-old Basset Hound that recently went under the knife in Dublin, Ireland, as SWNS reported. The dog was struggling to see due to his large and droopy eyelids — something his owner said was causing a concern. DOG LABELED ‘UGLY' FINDS HOME, UNDERGOES SURGERY AFTER HEARTBREAKING FACEBOOK POST: ‘SHE’LL NEVER GET ADOPTED' "We realized when Chief was just a puppy that his eyes were quite droopy — more than seemed normal," said Tracey McDermott, his owner. Chief, a three-year-old Basset Hound, required a surgical facelift after his excessively saggy skin began to negatively impact his life.  (SWNS) McDermott told SWNS her dog's sight became an issue as he continued to grow — adding that he would often become confused abou where to look when his name was called.  Chief’s eyes were also dry and sore — something McDermott said was a sign she needed to fix her pooch's problem. BRIDE-TO-BE FREAKS OUT WHEN FIANCE PUTS HIS DOG'S SURGERY OVER WEDDING: ‘HE’S A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY' McDermott took Chief to the Primrose Hill Veterinary Hospital in Dublin, where he was put through a five-hour plastic surgery operation to remove skin from across his neck and reposition his eyelids and eyebrows, according to SWNS.  Chief underwent surgery to pull back his eyelids to help his eyesight. (SWNS) Chief’s veterinary surgeon Mike Woods said Chief’s condition was typical of a Basset Hound, as the dogs are known for suffering from droopy eyes that cause sight issues.  Woods told SWNS that he performed a facelift to remove excess skin from the dog's neck — and then increased the tension of the skin from his eyelids to help with the droopy eye condition.  DOG SWALLOWS CAT TOY, HAS LIFESAVING PROCEDURE TO REMOVE PLASTIC FROM HER STOMACH "It was a long, challenging surgery, but everything went well," said the veterinary surgeon.  Chief is shown after his surgery.
