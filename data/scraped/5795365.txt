A Patriots fan brought a class-action lawsuit against Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen and others over their endorsement of FTX. Between his divorce from Gisele Bunchen and the Buccaneersâ struggles this season, it must have been a stressful fall for Tom Brady. Now we can add another thing to his plate this winter: Fighting off a class-action lawsuit. Brady, Bunchen and a host of other celebrities are in the crosshairs of the lawsuit brought byÂ Michael Livieratos, who happens to be a Patriots fan. When Michael Livieratos saw quarterback Tom Brady in a commercial for the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX, he knew exactly where he wanted to put his $30,000 crypto investment.He soon moved nearly all his money from another crypto exchange to FTX. https://t.co/LzlsNRpdCR âAs a New England Patriots fan my entire life, you can imagine the influence thatÂ Tom BradyÂ would have,â Livieratos told the Washington Post. Trusting Brady is at the crux of the argument for the lawsuit: Celebrity endorsements legitimized FTX despite serious issues with the company behind the scenes. Livieratos ended up putting $30,000 into FTX, an investment that came back to bite him when the company failed earlier this year. Weâll have to see if anything comes of this one, though itâll probably take some time for the dust to clear. The worst-case scenario is something like this pushing Brady closer to retirement or convincing him not to go back to New England if he does decide to continue his career outside of Tampa Bay, as has been rumored. This isnât the first lawsuit Brady and the others have had to deal with over their standing as FTX ambassadors. And itâs not even the most serious element surrounding the FTX fiasco for people like Brady with investigations at the state level also underway. Next.
