Outside of earning drops through watching the event, you can spend some cash on exclusive limited-time cosmetics. The Champions Collection provides you with plenty of things to show off as you frag out in a game of VALORANT. You can purchase the bundle with all of the featured items for 6,167 VALORANT Points. Each item is available separately, though. The Vandal can be bought alone for 2,675 VP. The Kunai is 5,350 VP on its own. Then you have the Spray at 325 VP, the Player Card at 375 VP, and Gun Buddy at 475 VP. And once again, the bundle will deliver 50% of all proceeds to participating teams.

Brandon Moore There are five items within the bundle: The Champions 2023 Vandal is the highlight of the bundle. It comes with a Top Frag Glow, highlighting the top fragger in the match. It also delivers an Ace Effect, which provides additional imagery if the final kill of the round is part of an Ace. Lastly, every three kills will see the skin evolve with a final radial effect if the user reaches 30. The VALORANT Champions 2023 bundle arrived just prior to the tournament beginning. You'll be able to get your hands on all of the goodies when the shop resets on August 4.  And if you can't purchase it right away, you have until August 29 at 2 p.m. PT. After that, it's gone.
