Popular Pokémon YouTuber “Rattle Pokémon” released an eight-part video series addressing Martinez’s alleged scam. Although Martinez never technically admitted fault or fessed up to the allegations, he did address the situation in an Instagram live video. "I understand the optics," he said. "I know the type of business I run. ...  I made a good amount of money -- everybody knows, in the NFL -- (and) I knew stepping into this (I) was going to have a target on my back." Martinez, who earned approximately $28.9 million from playing in the NFL, had made a reported $11.5M from buying and selling Pokémon cards in just under a year since his company’s launch. He retired from the NFL in 2022 after he sold a rare Pikachu illustrator card for $670,000. Martinez also earned $108,000 through his first stream on Whatnot.
