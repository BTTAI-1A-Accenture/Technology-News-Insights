Raymond Weil pays homage to its founder with the introduction of the Freelancer Pilot Flyback Chronograph — a timepiece that reflects Weil’s affinity for flying. The watch, developed under the leadership of Elie Bernheim, the CEO of Raymond Weil, and Pierre Bernheim, Chairman of Geneva’s Airport board, captures the essence of vintage aviation with its elegant and sleek design. Encased in a 42mm steel case coated in grey PVD, the timepiece exudes a refined aesthetic. It embraces traditional pilot watch elements, such as the onion-shaped crown and a brown leather strap adorned with rivets reminiscent of aircraft construction. Limited to just 400 pieces, the timepiece boasts exclusivity, and this is further highlighted by a propeller motif engraved on the sapphire case back. “This timepiece holds a special place in my heart as it was designed with my grandfather in mind”, Elie Bernheim stated. “The design of this watch has been inspired by his passion for flying and the aviation instruments of the past, with clear legibility and easy-to-read indicators.”
The Freelancer Pilot Flyback Chronograph is now available for purchase via the official Raymond Weil website and is priced at £3,695 (approx. $4,705 USD).
