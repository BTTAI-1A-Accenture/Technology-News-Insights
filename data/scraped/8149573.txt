 It's not like Nigeria is 'planless' regarding solutions to energy problems.  You need to see our beautifully drafted policies, our goals, visions and ambitions. They are brilliant 👏  And I need to establish that we are actually moving, there is progress. I mean check out what Nigeria's Rural Electrification Agency is doing.  Although it may not be as fast as we want, the plan to alleviate energy poverty is gradually coming into reality.  But seriously, I'm still trying to capture all the factors hindering our speed.😀😀😀  By the way, how are you doing today ?  So, I said I was going to talk about what Nigeria can learn from Kenya's 80% renewable energy mix of electricity.  Before diving in I think I should get you acquainted with Nigeria's energy goals and plans.  To the best of my knowledge for now, we have two major goals; The first is the vision 30:30:30 This vision is that Nigeria attains 30 GW of electricity, and 30% renewable energy mix by 2030. This is being driven by the Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria (REA).  The second is the Nigeria Energy Transition Plan (ETP) - This goal is for Nigeria to reach net zero carbon emission by 2060.  ETP is targeted towards the reduction of emissions across five key sectors of the economy namely, Power, Cooking, Oil and Gas, Transport and Industry.   Did you get it ? 😊😊  What do you think about the feasibility of these two ambitious visions of Nigeria's energy sector ?  I would love to read your opinion in the comment section.   Oluwanifemi  Yours in the Energy World   Energy | Power & Infrastructure | Project Finance | Sustainable Energy | Electricity Policy & Regulation My fear is that of continuity. The NETP looks very ambitious .My fear is that the next administration may come and throw it under the table. That has always been our situation in Nigeria Audit Manager at Ugochukwu Ukah & Co. I hope the nation sticks to this plan. We need the right people in place to propel this vision. Keep the good work on Nifemi.  Seems attainable with the right leadership and continous implementation of the policy at hand Professor of Mechanical Engrng (Energy Systems), Covenant University/Visiting Professor, Univer. of California, Berkeley These are ambitious targets. Highly ambitious targets. I hope adequate financing mechanisms are in place; otherwise the targets may be unrealistic in the long run. What is your take Oluwanifemi Ojo Next Trend Realty LLC./  Har.com/Chester-Swanson/agent_cbswan Congratulations.
