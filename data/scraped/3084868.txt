As TMS Network (TMSN) continues to grow through a relentless bear market, other crypto projects such as Litecoin (LTC) and XRP (XRP) continue to struggle. The cryptocurrency market isn’t easy to navigate, but TMS Network (TMSN) is quickly becoming a popular investment. TMS Network (TMSN) is only in phase two of its presale, and traders from all over are shifting their dollars to invest in the project. It’s no secret that Litecoin (LTC) is one of the first popular cryptocurrencies to exist, and it has a long-standing history in the crypto space. Litecoin (LTC) is widely respected as a decent long-term investment, but it doesn’t have the virality it was once known for. Designed for fast and secure, low-cost payments, Litecoin (LTC) uses blockchain tech in a variety of capacities. It’s also known for its block time of 2.5 minutes, and Litecoin (LTC) was created on the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol. Released well over ten years ago, Litecoin (LTC) has developed quite a bit over time and still poses itself as a relatively good investment. At this time, there are over 2,000 merchants that accept Litecoin (LTC) as a form of payment. The primary advantages of Litecoin (LTC) are speed and cost-effectiveness, on top of minimal fees. There are plenty of positives regarding the project, but it doesn’t hold significant investment value when compared to TMS Network (TMSN).  A cryptocurrency that was quite controversial for many years, XRP (XRP) has gone through many changes to stay afloat. This is primarily due to the battles it faced with the SEC, but XRP (XRP) is still going strong today. In its current era, XRP (XRP) is also known as XRP Ledger (XRPL).  The tech behind XRP (XRP) offers low cost-transactions with a scalability of 1,500 transactions every second. XRP (XRP) can also settle transactions in three to five seconds. The XRP (XRP) Ledger aims to support tokenization solutions and can also be used for building various enterprise solutions. Regarding investment value, XRP (XRP) is available for $0.42 at the time of writing. The chart has been trying its best to climb since June of last year, but it’s actively fighting against a bear market. No matter how XRP (XRP) has grown over the years, projects like TMS Network (TMSN) are soaring past it with flying colors. Many people in the crypto world are looking for a new project to believe in, and TMS Network (TMSN) is seen as a beacon of hope. Offering multiple services as a revolutionary trading platform, TMS Network (TMSN) will provide access to numerous markets. These include cryptocurrency, global equities, Forex, and CFDs.  TMS Network (TMSN) also promises to get a handle on market issues like price manipulation, wash trading, and a general lack of education on cryptocurrency. Investors can take advantage of several tools, including portfolio management, trading bots, on-chain analytics, and more. Token holders of TMS Network (TMSN) will also see exclusive benefits like commission revenue sharing, premium services, and even voting rights on governance decisions. The TMS Network (TMSN) token now sits at $0.088, and this seems to be growing by the day. Analysts are watching the project with a close eye, and many are very confident TMS Network (TMSN) will reach $1 to $2 before we know it.  The stats highlight that TMS Network (TMSN) is growing quickly, which is why so many investors are stocking up during its presale. Future predictions for the project clearly trump many other investment options, making them a top choice for traders from numerous markets.
