Adobe Stock assets can be purchased directly from within the Creative Cloud desktop apps or through the website. Beyond the free assets, stock media is available via a monthly or annual subscription, as well as through a credit pack system.  It’s worth mentioning that while Stock is fully integrated into Creative Cloud, it isn’t included in any Creative Cloud subscriptions. You’ll need to pay for an Adobe Stock subscription alongside your Creative Cloud membership. Downloading certain assets from stock.adobe.com requires no upfront paymen. All you’ll need to get started is an Adobe ID. If you choose an image from within a Creative Cloud app and click on the shopping cart symbol, you’ll automatically be directed to the stock.adobe.com website to license the asset and choose a payment option, if applicable. While a Creative Cloud membership isn’t required to use Adobe Stock, Creative Cloud members do benefit from the seamless integration within the apps they use.   Those requiring only standard assets (high-resolution photos, vectors, illustrations, and music tracks) may find the annual or monthly subscription plans for Adobe Stock most cost-effective.  Adobe Stock requires a monthly subscription or an annual subscription, or the purchase of credit packs.

If you need help getting started, there are a range of tutorials available by clicking here. The platform covers purchasing assets, licensing options and usage rights, and using Adobe Stock with Creative Cloud libraries.  With new content added daily, Adobe Stock provides millions of high-quality photos, vectors, illustrations, and 3D assets directly within Creative Cloud apps like Photoshop and InDesign. For many, the main draw to Adobe Stock is this integration; if you already use the Creative Suite, Adobe Stock simplifies your workflow by allowing you to browse assets without interruption. Harnessing the power of the AI tool Adobe Sensei, images are recommended and categorized to save time scrolling through assets. Adobe Stock also enables designers to create mock-ups using watermarked versions of images—a way of trying the asset before buying. If you’re happy with the design, you can license the image and it’ll immediately replace the watermarked version with the high-resolution image, saving hours of painstaking experimenting. The addition of artist-designed templates also aids creatives short on design time.  While you can access a host of Creative Cloud apps on the go - including Adobe Express and Adobe Lightroom - Adobe Stock doesn’t have a dedicated app for Android and iOS.  However, as the service is built directly into your Adobe desktop apps, you have the ability to browse and add images to your Creative Cloud libraries and access your assets from both mobile and desktop devices. There are also many alternative stock apps available on both Android and iOS, including iStock and Shutterstock.  We've tested, reviewed, and rated a range of alternatives to Adobe apps, including the best Photoshop alternatives and the best Lightroom alternatives.  For alternatives to Adobe Stock, we've rounded up the best Adobe Stock alternatives. Some top sites we recommend are Shutterstock, Pexels, and Unsplash, which offer thousands of free, beautiful assets.  Chelsea is a freelance writer with a degree in journalism from the London School of Journalism and a passion for lifestyle interests, especially as they intersect with consumer and business tech.  Grab Sage today and save 100% on subscriptions for a month Save 15% on Photoshop for three months with this exclusive Adobe deal "Not a human replacement" — Microsoft alters terms of service to remind users its AI services should not be taken too seriously TechRadar is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
