Ohtani's remarkable performance this season has made him a strong contender for the AL MVP award, leading the MLB in various categories. However, when facing left-handed pitchers like Freeland, Ohtani's performance suffers. He has a batting average of just .244 with limited hits, including three doubles and six home runs, in 91 plate appearances against southpaws. Furthermore, Ohtani's recent form has been less impressive, with a batting average of only .167 and three hits in his last 22 plate appearances. While many would expect Ohtani to easily exceed 1.5 bases in this matchup, taking the contrarian approach and betting on the under seems like a reasonable choice. Best MLB Prop Bet #1: Shohei Ohtani UNDER 1.5 bases (+105)   â­ Get $1,000 BetMGM Bonus for the Best MLB Props Today! â­     Bet on the Boston Red Sox to score first in their game against the Chicago White Sox on Friday night. Recently, the Red Sox have been successful in taking an early lead on the road, and they are likely to continue this trend. Even if they don't score in the top of the first inning, Boston still holds an offensive advantage over the White Sox throughout the season. With 386 runs scored compared to Chicago's 311, the Red Sox have consistently outscored their opponents by approximately one run per game. This disparity in offensive production favors Boston in this prop bet, as the more explosive team should have the upper hand in scoring first. Additionally, the Red Sox have the advantage of batting first in every inning, including the crucial top of the first. This means they will have more opportunities at the plate compared to the White Sox, further increasing their chances of scoring before their opponents. Considering these factors, the Red Sox are well-positioned to cash in on this prop bet as they face off against the White Sox in Chicago. Best MLB Player Prop Bet #2:  Red Sox to score first (-155)    â­ Get $200 bet365 bonus for the Best MLB Props Today! â­   Patrick Corbin is expected to concede over 5.5 hits in his upcoming outing. Despite losing his status as baseball's top fade pitcher, Corbin's underlying statistics indicate that he remains vulnerable to being hit hard and frequently. Although the Washington Nationals have occasionally won some of his starts, Corbin's performance mirrors his previous struggles, allowing a high number of runs. This season, Corbin's expected ERA stands at 6.30, accompanied by a .324 expected batting average and a .519 expected slugging percentage, all placing him in the bottom 6% of MLB pitchers. Facing the underachieving San Diego Padres, who have performed decently against left-handed pitching, further increases the likelihood of Corbin conceding hits. The Padres rank seventh in OPS and eighth in wRC+ when facing lefties this year. With Corbin averaging 11.5 hits per nine innings and frequently pitching deep into games, having recorded at least six innings pitched in 10 of his last 14 starts, it is surprising to see his hits allowed prop set at just 5.5. Even considering the odds, there is value in betting on Corbin surpassing that mark. Best MLB Player Prop Bet #3:  Patrick Corbin Over 5.5 hits allowed (-161)   â­ Corbin Over 5.5 hits allowed (-161)!!! â­ Expect Logan Webb to record over 18.5 outs in tonight's challenging matchup. Despite facing formidable opposition, betting on Webb surpassing this mark carries even odds. As San Francisco's ace, Webb has proven to be an innings workhorse, accumulating 98.1 innings in 15 starts this season, resulting in an average of 19.7 outs per start. Impressively, Webb has recorded over 18.5 outs in 10 of his last 12 starts, showcasing his consistency and ability to navigate deep into games. Additionally, Webb excels when pitching at home. Out of his six home starts this year, he has exceeded 18.5 outs in four of them. Moreover, in his 212.0 innings pitched at home since 2021, Webb boasts a remarkable 2.42 ERA, 2.76 xFIP, 1.12 WHIP, 5.6 BB%, and 25.4 K%, indicating his proficiency in dismantling even the most formidable MLB lineups. While the matchup presents challenges, Webb possesses the necessary skills to excel and go beyond 18.5 outs recorded.
