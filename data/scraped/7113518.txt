Radio City Music Hall, one of the world's most celebrated and architecturally significant entertainment venues, opened in the heart of midtown Manhattan amid great fanfare on this day in history, Dec. 27, 1932.  "Described as ‘the hottest ticket in town,’ more than 100,000 people requested admission (to opening night), but only 6,200 could be obliged," writes the website of the Radio City Rockettes, the iconic high-kicking dance troupe that performs at the theater. "Radio City quickly became the favorite first-run theater for moviemakers and moviegoers alike. Before long, a first showing at the Music Hall virtually guaranteed a successful run in theaters around the country." ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, DEC. 26, 1972, PRESIDENT HARRY S.
