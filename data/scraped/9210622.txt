 Hey there! Can you believe we're already bidding farewell to April? Time surely flies, doesn't it? And speaking of an eventful month, we have a bunch of exciting updates to share with you in this edition of the Brink Commerce monthly wrap-up! But that's not all â€“ we're thrilled to feature an insightful article from Priscilla Motta, a valued contributor from our partner Storyblok. Additionally, we'll take you to the Netherlands for an exciting event and delve into some significant product news that's bound to pique your interest. So, let's dive right in! Consumer behavior is constantly changing how buyers are shopping and interacting with brands and products. Some new habits are becoming very popular amongst consumers, such as online shopping, value-consciousness, personalization, interactive products, and multi-experiential interactions. These tendencies are transforming how eCommerce companies operate.Â  Brands are looking into a more customer-centric approach and developing new marketing strategies to attract and engage consumers. To accommodate new requirements from consumers and create a personalized omnichannel experience, new technologies (such as Headless Content Management Systems like Storyblok and Headless eCommerce like Brink Commerce) are supporting eCommerce brands to differentiate themselves and finally offer a real digital experience to consumers.Â  To overcome major challenges, companies are starting to consider working with future-oriented solutions and the best of breed approach, incorporating those microservices into their technical ecosystems in order to create a seamless and unique experience for their customers.Â  I believe that to be ahead of the game, some trends that might shape the future of eCommerce are:Â  To offer a multichannel experience (Website, Apps, Digital Screens, Voice Activated Speaker, Storefront, and Smartwatches) and making use of social commerce (social platforms to market and sell products) will allow brands to have a closer relationship with their customers.Â  The use of Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Interactive Products can support customers to find items easily, answer questions faster, and recommend solutions on time.Â  Green initiatives are meeting market demands while safeguarding the environment. Sustainable eCommerce does not degrade the natural environment, and it involves practices such as waste reduction, minimizing CO2 emissions, using eco-friendly packaging, etc.Â  A tailored storytelling, with customized messaging, proven to connect with the modern behavior of customers, building trust and increasing their satisfaction with the digital experience. Personalized messaging, delivered fast with high quality, will have a direct impact on the brand's success.Â  Companies will work in a more efficient way with best-of-breed and Headless technologies allowing them to select the best in class in their own niche and connect those microservices into a modern tech stack that will operate in a secure and adaptable environment.Â  The future of eCommerce is not only about selling products online but also about creating memorable and engaging experiences for customers across multiple channels and platforms. To thrive in this competitive and dynamic market, brands need to leverage the power of new technologies and customer behavior analysis. The future of eCommerce is exciting and challenging, and I believe that brands that embrace these trends will have a competitive edge over their rivals. Do you see another trend? Feel free to share in the comments below.Â  Priscilla Motta, Account Executive, Storyblok GmbH On June 20th, we hosted Let's Rock Retail in Amsterdam, together with Sitoo, Voyado, and Magnus Black. A great night full of interesting conversations, great food, and some nice drinks. We want to thank everyone that stopped by. We will be back again soon - so stay tuned. Exciting new premium brand Ã€VORA, founded by successful entrepreneurs and friends Bianca Ingrosso and Vanessa Lindblad, together with Victor Appelqvist, offers a collection of feminine and iconic silhouettes made from sustainable materials that can withstand the test of time. The newly launched company is now taking its first step towards becoming a brand at the forefront of premium fashion, with Brink Commerce API as the eCommerce foundation. Read the news here We are set to release a brand new API tailored specifically to meet the needs of online retailers. The new API is designed to maximize flexibility while maintaining top-notch performance and scalability. As you may know, We already provide a rock-solid Brand API that serves multiple global-selling brands. However, we understand that online retailing comes with its own set of unique challenges, and we are here to solve them for you. With our new API, you can expect to have even more powerful tools at your disposal to help you streamline your operations and drive more sales. We can't wait to share more details with you soon, so stay tuned ðŸ˜Ž We are happy to announce some recent developments that will allow merchants to expand their promotional capabilities and help to drive more sales. Over the last month, we have extended the promotion capabilities of our API, giving merchants more options to tailor their promotions and entice their customers to make purchases. One of the key developments is the ability to create tailored promotions with the "buy one, get one" feature. Allowing merchants to configure promotions in a more granular way and make them more effective for target audiences. Whether you want to offer a recurring promotion or a one-time offer, the new features will give you more flexibility to create the perfect promotion to drive sales.  The other exciting update is the introduction of Gift with Purchase (GWP) as a discount code. GWP promotions have been around for a while, and they have been shown to be incredibly effective in driving sales. Now, with the added ability to offer GWP as a discount code, merchants can provide their customers with even more value and make promotions more enticing than ever before. Have a great rest of the week! /Team Brink Commerce
