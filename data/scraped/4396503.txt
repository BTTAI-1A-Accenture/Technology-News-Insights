Let us assume that a limited company has achieved the following financial results in three years: I Year : Loss of GBP 2 000 II Year: Loss of GBP 1 000 III Year: Profit GBP 5 000 (after tax) The company wants to pay a dividend for the third year, so does the profit from the third year have to cover the losses from previous years first (to be paid 2 000 GBP), or the entire amount of the profit after tax from third year can be paid out (to be paid 5 000 GBP)? My question is very simplistic, it is only about the question of covering losses from previous years. Yes.  In your example, max yr 3 dividend is 2000. You might want to take your accountant's advice to ensure that other formalities are complied with. Dividends can only be paid to the extent that they are covered by retained earnings. If retained earnings (calculated as brought-forward profit / loss plus current year profit / loss) are negative, then a dividend cannot be paid. In your example, retained earnings = -£2,000 + -£1,000 + £5,000 = £2,000 So in this case, the maximum dividend which can be paid is £2,000. The losses must be covered before dividends are paid.

Recommend you get an appointment with an accountant as you are asking questions one at at a time.
If you are in year four, why are you looking to backdate dividends?
And does year 4 have any profit in it Agree both posters

Critically tax needs to be deducted from the profit together with any creditors The amount available for dividend would depend on how the profits/ losses have arisen. If, for example, they have all arisen from revaluation of investment property, then the maximum dividend amount would be £nil. Agree, though, for most purposes, the maximum distributable income is the balance  on the P+L - the one on the balance sheet, not the separate sheet showing the profit for the year - less any known losses subsequent to that. If you (the OP) are thinking that this is complicated, you're right. Have you allowed for corporation tax losses b/f ?
