The son of Andrew and Marion (Bross) Dunar, he was born on July 16, 1949 in Milwaukee, WI. Tim graduated from Homestead High School in 1967 and received his B.A. and M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee. He had a long career in marketing. He was an active volunteer, with leadership roles in Boy Scouts, Lumen Christi Catholic Church, the United Fund, and Milwaukee Public Television. He also volunteered for the Wisconsin Humane Society for over thirty years, during that time raising hundreds of foster kittens. The ultimate family man, he always put his family first. He enjoyed reading, theater, concerts, gardening, and sports. He was a wonderful person who was always seeking to improve himself. He is survived by his best friend and wife of 43 years, Louise Dernehl; his children Katharine, Edward (Kathryn), and Daniel; his grandson Paul; brother Andrew (Catherine) Dunar and sister Cynthia (the late I. James) Church; as well as many nieces, nephews, cousins, and friends. A private funeral is planned. Memorials to Milwaukee Public Television, Wisconsin Humane Society, or a fine arts organization of your choice are appreciated. Posted online on January 22, 2023 Published in Journal Sentinel
