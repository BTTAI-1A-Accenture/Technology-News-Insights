While the EV adoption is largely driven by 2W and 3W segments, cars and buses too have begun to witness a rising trend in annual sales volumes. Although each segment will reach an inflexion point of adoption at its own pace depending on multiple supply and demand factors, what remains a common denominator across all vehicle segments to determine future rate of adoption, is a country wide and efficient network of charging stations.
