Mobile POS systems are less expensive than full-service terminals, and they’re often used by smaller retailers or foodservice operations such as food trucks. A POS system is a software and hardware system that businesses use to take payments, track sales, manage inventory and connect to other business systems. With its reports and analytics, business owners can also make informed decisions about their business.
