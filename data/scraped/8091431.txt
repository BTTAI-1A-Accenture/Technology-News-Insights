For example, I recently discovered that the film industry uses AI for script development. I thought it was a bunch of screenwriters using ChatGPT because they were lazy or suffering from writer's block. But companies like StoryFit are using AI in a much different way. Monica Landers, founder and CEO of StoryFit, acknowledges the peculiarity of using AI to evaluate audience connections with narratives or characters. I sat down with Landers to discuss leadership, storytelling, AI, and the film industry. "I believe storytelling is humanity, so it sounds very abrasive to say, 'Let's apply technology to that,'" she said. At its core, StoryFit compiles data on storytelling elements in scripts, enabling insights into their efficacy and significance. In part, these insights—both artificial and human—help studios decide which scripts to acquire, which characters to promote, or which books to adapt into films. Initially, Monica developed the technology to aid publishers in narrowing down their "slush piles" to a shortlist of promising books. "We felt like we were doing good by uncovering writers that might not have been discovered and also helping the publishers get their work done," Landers said. However, StoryFit found the publishing industry's growth potential and antiquated thinking insufficient and targeted the film industry instead. Consequently, it has become the force behind several successful films and TV series in recent years. Primarily, StoryFit analyzes a script's marketability, assessing where a story fits with the audience and how each narrative element resonates. The film industry is high-risk, with considerable investments required before generating returns. StoryFit provides data on whether those risks are likely to be fruitful. StoryFit's AI technology scrutinizes character traits to evaluate audience responses, determining how heroic or relatable a main character might be. This information allows creative professionals to identify potential character imbalances. As cinephiles, the StoryFit team frequently applies their technology to beloved TV series. "What we like to do as a company is celebrate the great storytellers because there's a lot of great characters out there," Landers suggested. "I think one that I always remember is The Queen’s Gambit. Who would've guessed a series about chess would be any good? But when we measure that character, she is off the charts strong and original. So those are the kind of elements we're looking for." The team was also captivated by HBO's The Last of Us, which introduced a new post-pandemic era of zombie apocalypse cinema. StoryFit employed AI technology to analyze the evolution of zombie-related films and series. It subsequently published a fascinating case study on its website, exploring how socio-political events have shaped the genre. The StoryFit team conducted another intriguing analysis of male and female characters' roles. Their findings revealed that male characters spoke more frequently than female characters in movies, and they often discussed achievements and goals. In contrast, female characters use more compassionate, cool-headed language. "Women ask more questions, so they're setting up the man for, 'What do we do?' And that's a measurable three times more questions," Landers explained. StoryFit analyzes audience connections to the storyline, offering insights into aspects such as the audience's emotional journey throughout an episode or the impact of a favorite character's departure. The company also reports on plot inconsistencies, such as characters behaving inconsistently with their established traits or vanishing from the storyline. Nevertheless, Landers emphasizes that their role is to draw insights from the data rather than opine on the script. She stated, "You have people whose whole careers are based on making those decisions. But we can be a technology voice that helps them to shine a light on what's happening or not happening in the script." By leveraging AI systems, the film and entertainment industry can make data-driven decisions to enhance storytelling, character development, and audience engagement. These insights not only help studios mitigate risks but also contribute to creating more compelling and relatable stories that resonate with viewers. As AI evolves and improves, its applications within the film industry will likely expand, offering even more sophisticated insights and analyses to filmmakers and studios. But, for now, the power of AI in storytelling serves as a testament to the innovative ways technology can be utilized to strengthen the human experience and our connection to the stories we love. Additionally, the data-driven approach made possible by AI serves as a crucial tool to better understand the ever-changing landscape of audience preferences and storytelling techniques in a field where taking risks can result in enormous success or colossal failure. Moreover, as the roles of male and female characters in film continue to evolve, AI has proven instrumental in identifying trends and highlighting areas for improvement. By recognizing these patterns, the film industry can work towards creating more diverse and inclusive stories that accurately represent the experiences of all audience members. Using AI technology like StoryFit in the film industry demonstrates artificial intelligence's potential to enhance storytelling. AI is revolutionizing how scripts are developed, and stories are told by providing valuable insights into audience connections, character development, and marketability. As the technology advances, its impact on the film industry will only grow, paving the way for more engaging and resonant cinematic experiences. It makes me wonder if George Lucas should have asked C3PO for advice on the character development of Jar Jar Binks in The Phantom Menace.
