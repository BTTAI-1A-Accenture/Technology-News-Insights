YUMA, Ariz. (KYMA, KECY) - Los Algodones has become a popular tourist destination for winter visitors in recent years. This is because of the inexpensive shopping and restaurants as well as inexpensive medical care and prescription medicines.  The warm, dry climate of the area attracts a number of older tourists from across the United States and Canada who winter in the nearby towns of Yuma and Winterhaven, California.  Los Algodones is located just 10 miles west of Yuma. The border line is practically around the corner, so you don't even need to worry about having a car. Visiting Los Algodones means being in a place with the antique Mexican charm, but with access to everything you need from the US. This is one reason why the snowbirds have made Los Algodones their favorite place.
