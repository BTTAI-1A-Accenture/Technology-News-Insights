EGLE’s response stated that they’re aware of the requests from legislators to provide more opportunities for public input and information on the hazardous waste deep injection well.The response said they are in multiple conversations with elected officials and others about those requests.

“At this time, we’re still in discussions and no decisions have been reached,” a statement from EGLE said.Since that response was made, opposition against the move has grown.U.S. Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-6th District), Rashida Tlaib (D-12th District), and Shri Thanedar (D-13th District) also drafted a letter to EGLE recently urging the agency to reopen the window for public feedback regarding the renewal of the operating license for Republic Services.The request comes after learning the public was unable to properly provide input or properly express concerns with this site and the movement of hazardous waste into Romulus.The derailment occurred on Feb. 3.“On February 24, we were all alarmed to learn that Norfolk Southern and Republic Industrial and Energy Services had reached an agreement to dispose of toxic waste from East Palestine, Ohio at the disposal site in Romulus, Michigan without notification of local authorities and elected officials,” the lawmakers wrote. “Working closely with the Governor’s office, EGLE officials, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, we were able to act quickly to halt further shipments and return truckloads of hazardous waste to Ohio.“But this experience has clearly demonstrated that there is an urgent need for further public discourse about how and where we dispose of toxic and hazardous waste. Debate about the permitting of this site has continued for decades as former Congressman John D. Dingell, Jr. led efforts to oppose this facility, and we remain concerned to this day about the health and environmental risks posed by its continued operation in Romulus in the surrounding region.”EGLE has maintained from the start that neither they nor the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires hazardous waste haulers to notify them of individual shipments as long as the facility is licensed to accept the material coming in, as is the case for Republic Services.The lawmakers’ letter went on to say that Republic had applied for a license renewal for the facility and that the public comment period had closed.Though some state elected officials were informed about the public hearing, many of the first responders who are most impacted by the renewal application was not aware and not able to provide comment.Even Republic officials reportedly said they were caught off guard and had no heads up on the hazardous material being brought to the well.The latest letter stressed that the renewal process for a facility as controversial as the company must include “robust public discussion and debate,” and it was not provided.It also said notification of public comment periods and public hearings on topics this sensitive must be widespread and must include a more comprehensive outreach strategy engaging all local leaders in the surrounding region.“We strongly urge EGLE to reopen and extend the public comment period for this facility, as well as hold another public hearing on its approval with a stronger communication plan for the Romulus community and surrounding region,” the letter said. “Our communities deserve to be fully informed and have the opportunity to express their concerns before a final decision is made.”In the derailment, 38 cars left the track, 11 of them were carrying hazardous waste.Among county officials who expressed outrage was Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.In a recent public gathering, Evans said he just doesn’t understand how the decisions that were made could be done without informing anyone locally.More protests have been organized with participants carrying signs that read, “Don’t bring your derailment waste here” and “Don’t dump poison where people live.”A group of attorneys are now working to make sure hazardous waste can’t be brought to the facility in the future by seeking an injunction.On Friday, Dearborn-based Michael Jaafar Law Firm filed a lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court against Norfolk Southern, alleging the rail company endangered the community when it transported and disposed of the Ohio toxic waste in Michigan.The suit asks Wayne County Judge Charlene Elder to “issue an order requiring Norfolk Southern to immediately cease the transportation and dumping of toxic chemicals from Ohio to Michigan, and to take any necessary steps to remediate the harm caused by its recent activities, including necessary oversight, testing, and sampling of the containment area, and necessary maintenance to ensure proper containment.” The Norfolk Southern Railway train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, last month has turned into a hazardous waste-dumping fiasco in Romulus.
