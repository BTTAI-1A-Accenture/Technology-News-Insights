 LegalZoom is one of the most well-known online legal help platforms in the country and for good reason. Customer reviews speak favorably of LegalZoom’s LLC formation services and affordable pricing, and I found it straightforward to go through the sign-up process. Services include LLC, nonprofit, corporation or sole proprietorship formation, as well as a doing business as (DBA) service and a registered agent service. They also offer bookkeeping and tax preparation through LZ Books and LZ Tax, respectively. All told, LegalZoom offers not just a service for filing LLCs but the possibility for a whole small business management platform, depending on how you configure your plan. While this may not be of interest to some customers, I do appreciate that LegalZoom offers a breadth of services for would-be entrepreneurs. David J Greiner, Esq., has guided clients through the LLC formation process and also likes LegalZoom as a top option: “LegalZoom is often the go-to for many of my clients due to its widespread brand recognition. It’s user-friendly and covers the basics well, making it suitable for business owners who are just starting out and need straightforward services. However, the platform can be pricier compared to others, especially when add-ons are considered. While it’s comprehensive, the cost factor is something small business owners should weigh.” LegalZoom offers basic LLC plans that only require you to pay your state’s filing fee. However, they also offer a detailed Pro plan that includes documents like an operating agreement, an employer identification number (EIN) and other benefits. The top-shelf Premium plan offers all the features of the Pro package while adding hands-on guidance from experienced attorneys who know all of the needs and requirements of your state. It also comes with 30 days of unlimited 30-minute consultations about any new legal topics that might affect doing business in your state. While configuring my plan, I found it very intuitive to add or edit services as needed and get to the checkout page with all my options in my cart. LegalZoom does a solid job of laying out all of these options for users regardless of their technical skill level or familiarity with company formation. LegalZoom is one of the top providers of company formation services in the United States, and I find that its reputation is well-earned. Customers generally like LegalZoom and find that it is easy to use, reasonably priced and has all the features they need. The LegalZoom platform has a range of different customer support options. It offers a customer care line open seven days a week during daytime hours and a chat feature. It also has a frequently asked question section on its Contact Us page. Of course, this is all in addition to the hands-on help you get if you choose the company’s Premium plan. LegalZoom offers iOS and Android apps to help you manage the formation of your company wherever you may be. The app has support for forming an LLC, corporation or DBA and it also has support for LZ Books. I had no trouble getting the app up and running and found it to be just as intuitive as the web version of the service.

 During sign-up, I had my choice of one of three LLC packages. Starter is deemed the “free” plan, though you must pay state fees associated with your LLC formation. The Pro and Premium packages cost $199 and $349 annually, and unlike the Starter option, they each renew annually. These packages include things like operating agreements, EINs, faster filing and for the Premium package, a domain name, website builder and business documents. I appreciated ZenBusiness’s personalized approach to the sign-up process. Rather than a bland form or setup wizard, ZenBusiness engages you with lively imagery and a simple-to-follow series of questions that help you think carefully about exactly the type of business you’re forming. For instance, it asked whether I intended to bring on employees or if I needed additional support to maintain compliance. During sign-up, you can include vital add-ons such as an EIN, operating agreement and registered agent service. It is important to note that while some additional features, such as your operating agreement, are a one-time charge, “worry-free compliance” and registered agent services represent recurring charges. The sign-up process only took a few minutes. I liked the highly customizable nature of ZenBusiness’s formation process; it feels like the service can work just as well for someone creating an LLC for the first time as it would for a business owner well-versed in creating multiple businesses. Daniel Meursing, founder and CEO of Premier Staff, also likes ZenBusiness: “What impressed me about ZenBusiness was its user-friendly platform and the speed with which they were able to process my paperwork. They use automation to streamline many of the tedious aspects of business formation, which can save you a lot of time and hassle. … For tech-savvy entrepreneurs who value efficiency and simplicity, ZenBusiness is worth considering.” ZenBusiness has LLC formation packages starting at $0 plus state filing fees. During my sign-up process, various add-ons were suggested to me that were free for the first month or year. Not having to pay much of anything upfront is great for small business owners who want to get the filing process started immediately while keeping costs low. Still, keeping track of recurring charges is crucial, as these costs can add up quickly. You’ll also need to know of any impending due dates for monthly or annual fees. ZenBusiness enjoys a strong reputation in its industry thanks to thousands of positive customer reviews. Moreover, it is accredited with the Better Business Bureau, where it has an A+ rating. In researching the product, I found the overall customer consensus to be very positive, with many praising ZenBusiness for low formation fees and excellent customer service. I contacted ZenBusiness by phone to ask how their compliance process worked. Though I ultimately went with a different company, I still appreciated how helpful and informative the agent I spoke to was. ZenBusiness clearly has responsive enough support to meet the needs of all kinds of companies. In addition to calling, you can also submit questions using a form on their website; you can give them the option to get back to you by phone or email. Alternatively, you may be able to find answers to questions using articles in ZenBusiness’s help center. ZenBusiness previously took a somewhat “mobile-centric” approach to forming your business. When I signed up in the past, ZenBusiness guided me through the process as if I were sending text messages back and forth with a friend. This process has changed, with ZenBusiness opting for a still animated but more formal approach. Unfortunately, while available through the Google Play and App Store, the mobile app isn’t as easy to use as one would think. The app loads with a “Log In” option but no option for first-time users. The log-in button takes you to a mobile website rather than into the app, where you are expected to sign in, which is problematic if you don’t have an account. The “Forgot Password” option promised to send an email that never arrived in my inbox, and the “Need Help?” option guided me to FAQs pages that didn’t solve my problem. This wasn’t an issue in the past, so I can only say that recent changes do not favor new mobile app users. Learn more: Read our ZenBusiness review See MoreSee Less Starting Price  $0 + state fee

 Bizee lets business owners and entrepreneurs get straight to the point―its offerings are streamlined, straightforward and easy to use. Its package plans provide a quick and painless plan of attack for getting a new LLC off the ground. The platform offers everything from essential LLC formation services to extras like EINs, tax forms for your business and business contract templates. Bizee has all the basics you may need in your new company’s journey. Dayten Rynsburger is the CRO at Niche Capital CO, and he has found Bizee to be his top pick: “When it comes to LLC formation services, each one has its pros and cons. However, my experience with Bizee (formerly Incfile) was that it had the best user experience, particularly easy for those who are new to LLC formation. The company’s user interface is very intuitive and the process for forming a business is simple and straightforward. The service also excels at providing support along the way and making each step of the process clear.” Like other types of services in this space, Bizee offers a standard business formation package that doesn’t require you to spend more than the LLC filing fee in your state. But from there, you have many optional add-ons and extras. The company’s Gold package starts at $199 and provides access to an operating agreement, banking resolution and other useful documents. The Platinum package takes it a step further with a starting cost of $299 and adds things like business contract templates, expedited filing and even a domain name for your new company. All packages offer free registered agent service for the first year, which is a nice perk that other formation companies don’t offer. After the first year, it costs $119/year. Many of these Gold and Platinum features can also be purchased individually, which I appreciated while examining the platform. Bizee’s offerings have a solid reputation among customers. With an average rating of 4.7 on Trustpilot, users clearly have a lot of confidence in the platform and trust it with their important business documents. While Bizee is a relatively new name in the industry, the platform has been available for some time as Incfile, which previously enjoyed a good reputation for its services. Bizee’s Resource Center offers a solid amount of information for would-be entrepreneurs as well as those already on their journey. They have tools for comparing different business entities, formation information for each state and a contact number available during the day from Monday to Friday. Users can also create support tickets from the company’s contact page. Unfortunately, Bizee does not have a mobile app at this time. While customers can access the web version of Bizee from their mobile devices, I would have appreciated a dedicated mobile offering similar to what LegalZoom has.

 Rocket Lawyer is a comprehensive resource for anyone wanting to form a new LLC. I found it helpful for establishing a new business and easy to keep up with compliance and handle tax obligations. It only took me a few minutes to complete the formation process. Rocket Lawyer also offered me registered agent services and an EIN for an additional fee. While Rocket Lawyer is a reputable resource for forming and maintaining your LLC, it offers other useful legal services such as creating legal documents, getting advice from lawyers and tax preparation. Like many competitors, the platform aims to be a one-stop-shop of sorts for all things entrepreneurial. David J Greiner, Esq., a lawyer who has helped clients form LLCs, agrees that Rocket Lawyer’s legal services are a big perk: “Rocket Lawyer offers a subscription model that is exceptionally appealing for those who anticipate needing continual legal services beyond just LLC formation. This could include drafting contracts or seeking regular legal advice. The unique selling point here is their on-call attorneys, which my clients have found useful for quick legal consultations without the added burden of hefty fees typically associated with direct legal services.” Rocket Lawyer offers two subscription models, both with a free seven-day trial. Rocket Legal is $39.99 per month and gives you access to business formation services for an additional $99.99. Rocket Legal+ is $19.99 per month or $239.88 per year and business formation is free under this plan. Extra add-on service pricing depends on the plan you choose. For example, you can get a registered agent for $249.99 per year with the Rocket Legal plan or $124.99 per year with the Rocket Legal+ plan. Rocket Lawyer has an overall positive reputation, as it has been a helpful resource for establishing LLCs and other business entities for years. A few customers felt that the monthly subscription wasn’t necessary as many options are suitable for a one-time charge, but overall, the feedback was good. Rocket Lawyer is very proactive in helping customers start their businesses. If you start the process but pause, a team member will email you to ask if you need assistance finishing the process. When reaching out to Rocket Lawyer for support (which is available weekdays or by chat or email), I found that the live agents were quick to respond and were very helpful with any issues that arose during and after completing the formation process. Rocket Lawyer has a mobile app available for download on Apple and Android devices. The app is a streamlined version of the website’s services. Because of this, it can be used for LLC formation, signing legal documents or seeking legal advice in the same way as the website.

 While it’s not one of the industry’s most recognized names, Active Filings has been in business for more than two decades and offers three LLC filing packages. I found the sign-up process to be less user-friendly than other sites that guide you through a detailed question process. But with Active Filings, you do have all the information in front of you on one page, which can be helpful. Signing up for the free Starter package involves providing your business name, the name of the LLC members, your mailing address and your contact details. Depending on which package you’re signing up for, Active Filings will offer paid add-ons, such as getting a business address or EIN. I liked that the processing time is included on the sign-up page, so you can know when to expect your company to be up and running. What makes Active Filings stand out to me is its separate packages specifically designed for international entrepreneurs, which are called International Silver and International Gold. These are significantly more expensive than Active Filing’s regular options, but their services and user experience are tailor-made for non-United States citizens, allowing them to form a business in a few select U.S. states. Founded by a Spanish speaker, the company also offers all its services and support in a Spanish language option. Active Filings offers a free Starter package (just pay your state’s filing fee). This package includes a free Registered Agent for the first year and an annual compliance report. To get more features, such as a free EIN and business address, you’ll need to upgrade to the Sprinter package for $100 plus state fee or the Finisher package for $250 plus state fee. Jonathan Feniak, General Counsel at LLC Attorney, also finds the service affordable: “Active Filings delivers affordability for startups, which makes it an accessible choice for entrepreneurs launching their first business. Their customer service is commendable, assisting in the process.” Active Filings isn’t super well-known and, as a result, doesn’t have a lot of reviews. On Google, I found the company has 4.5 stars from 32 reviews. Overall, customers seem happy with the service, with many reviewers having filed multiple companies using Active Filings. I noticed a few recurring comments about being charged for annual report service that they did not expect. On BBB, Active Filings has a 5-star rating, but this is based on just two reviews. Active Filings has office hours of Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST. This could be a problem if you need help after hours or live in a different time zone. You can reach them via the phone or by filling out a contact form on the site. I appreciate that Active Filings says on their site they do not use a remote call center, meaning you should reach someone who works directly for the company. There is no live chat feature, however, which I would prefer to see for quicker help. Active Filings does not have a mobile app at this time, so you’ll need to use a desktop browser to access the site. Learn more: Read our full Active Filings review.

 General Features While Swyft Filings does have some positive advantages to its service, such as a $0 starting cost aside from state fees and same-day filing with its Premium plan, I wasn’t quite as impressed with the available features across most of its plans. For example, during sign-up, I was offered registered agent and compliance options as paid add-ons. Other competitors include registered agent service for a year or compliance measures at no extra cost. While Swyft did offer some level of convenience in terms of upfront fees, it still struck me as less flexible and ultimately less affordable than some LLC services. Ultimately, Swyft Filings provides a decent range of package options with a bare-bones plan that will save you some upfront costs. Still, if you are new to LLC formation and want a standard, uncomplicated process and the potential to get everything filed the same day, Swyft Filings is worth considering. Jonathan Feniak, General Counsel at LLC Attorney, shared his thoughts with us on Swyft Filings: “Swyft Filings stands out for its speed and efficiency. Their name lives up to their service as they streamline the process to minimally disrupt business operations. The added tracking tool is particularly helpful to keep track of the process, minimizing guesswork.” Pricing Swyft Filings has three LLC packages to choose from, with pricing starting at $0 plus state filing fees. The Premium LLC plan costs $299 but is the best value for money despite being the most expensive, as it not only includes everything you need to form and maintain your business, but also includes same-day filing, putting you on the path to establishing your new business as quickly as possible. Reputation As Swyft was formed in 2015, it is one of the newer LLC services in the industry. Even so, its reputation continues to grow, and it already has thousands of customer reviews, most of which are positive. In researching customer experience, much of the feedback included high praise for sales and customer support members, either in how they helped them address issues or navigate confusion experienced when signing up. I was concerned about a pattern among negative reviews where multiple dissatisfied customers mentioned issues with cancellation, as well as unexplained or hidden charges they experienced. Customer Service Customer support is very easy to reach by phone, email or chat. In my experience, the support team members were very professional and quick to respond. I cannot speak to any issues with canceling service. However, when it came to solving account issues or answering questions, my experience was positive. Mobile App As of now, unfortunately, there isn’t a mobile app available for Swyft Filings, so you will need to complete the process on a desktop device.

 As its name implies, Northwest Registered Agent is a platform that primarily offers registered agent services to customers. The company also offers additional services for forming LLCs, corporations and a wide range of other business formation tasks. During the setup process, I had the option to either go with my existing registered agent or add their service. I appreciated Northwest’s “Privacy By Default” offer. This feature comes with any of their services and works to maintain user’s privacy. Northwest will use their address and information on documents whenever possible to limit your personal data exposure. I did not like that Northwest took you partially through the sign-up process and then halted everything to get you to create an account. It would have been less jarring to begin the process by creating an account or holding this option until the end at the checkout page. I also noted during the signup phase is that that Northwest Registered Agent didn’t reveal total service charges until I created an account. For transparency and convenience, I believe it would be much easier for customers to decide if the service is worth the investment if they knew the total expense before creating a new account. Other providers show costs at all steps. Brette Sember, our advisory board member, uses Northwest herself for her own LLC. “I found Northwest Registered Agent easy to work as the registered agent for my LLC. Their rates are reasonable and they send me yearly reminders to file the annual report. They have been quick to respond when I’ve had questions and have provided a reliable service,” she shared. Northwest Registered Agent will file your LLC paperwork for the flat rate of $39 plus state fees. You’ll also get a free year of registered agent service. After that, the cost is $125 per year.  Northwest also charges $310 for expedited, one-day filing service when forming an LLC in Delaware. While the ability to speed up the process is convenient, I felt that the overall cost was too expensive, and I could get better rates elsewhere. Based on the thousands of customer reviews for Northwest Registered Agent, the overall impression of the platform is positive. With that said, a significant number of people seem to feel the service is just okay, if not somewhat mediocre. The review scores averaged around 3.7 to 3.8 across reputable review and customer feedback websites. Customers who gave positive reviews mention that the service is convenient for managing businesses in multiple states. They also praised the customer support team. Negative feedback mentions a “buggy” or “glitchy” website experience, and some customers mentioned that aside from LLC formation, add-ons are not delivered as promised or there are transparency issues concerning details within the fine print. Northwest Registered Agent provides customer support between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. I selected the chat option but found it temporarily unavailable due to the live agents working with other customers; it became available again after a few minutes, but the website let me know that during such periods, I could reach the support team by phone or email. Northwest Registered Agent currently lacks a mobile app. For now, you’ll need to access the service through a web browser.

 BetterLegal offers a single plan option for establishing an LLC or a corporation. As such, the process is simplified and includes everything you need to form a new company. While BetterLegal promises a turnaround of about two days, this refers to its internal process; the company doesn’t have any direct control over when your documents get approved by the state. In addition to assisting you with formation, BetterLegal offers registered agent and compliance services. It also assists with researching what permits and licenses you need within a specific state. I noted that while BetterLegal provides the documentation and instructions for filing, it does not file for permits or licenses for you. I went through the LLC filing process through the website, and it only took a couple of minutes to submit all the requested information. I appreciated the option to both add and remove registered agent and compliance add-ons; this is useful for anyone who might decide they don’t need them and wish to reduce the upfront cost. I noted a slight inconsistency with the proposed turnaround; it said I should expect everything to take about 10 days, but it’s unclear if this is with or without the proposed two-day internal turnaround for processing customer documents. BetterLegal charges a flat $299 rate for LLC formation, making it among the most expensive LLC services available. That said, its registered agent and compliance fees are among the most affordable, with the option to pay $90 per year or $10 monthly. With this in mind, BetterLegal might cost more upfront than alternatives, but it ultimately represents better savings for annual charges. Though it appears to be run by a very small team and has fewer reviews than better-established competitors, BetterLegal has a decent reputation as an LLC formation service. Most customers find the service and process simple to use and follow. A few customers found service features unclear, and others expressed dismay over the charges, but this seemed to come down to a lack of understanding regarding the process. BetterLegal might need to explain better what its services include to avoid further customer confusion. If you need help with BetterLegal or have questions, you can reach out directly by phone, chat or complete the contact form on the website. I noted that in cases where customers reached out to the BBB regarding service, they also heard from a support team member in response to their complaints. Tommy Mello, an entrepreneur and founder of A1 Garage Door Service, shared his thoughts with us on BetterLegal’s customer service: “Quick turnaround times and responsive customer service are crucial for entrepreneurs, especially during the early stages of building a business. BetterLegal seems to excel in these areas, making them a compelling option for those looking for a hassle-free LLC formation experience.” BetterLegal doesn’t have a mobile app of any kind; you’ll need to access the company website to use their service.

 Filenow’s LLC packages cover state filings, including electronic filings, as well as name searches and a business bank account. You also get live customer support by phone or email. I signed up for the Premium package, which includes essential features such as registered agent service, an EIN, an operating agreement, a banking resolution and business templates. It also provides a 24-hour processing time, speeding up your business formation timeline. Filenow’s LLC process was simple enough, and I appreciated that the company was very clear about what items were included in the package and what they would cost separately. I was offered the choice between using my own address or having Filenow provide a professional address and a virtual mailbox. They told me a team member would contact me to help with the process. The sign-up and formation process is stretched out by repeated upsells that pause the process. Having these options listed on a single page while checking out would have been much more convenient and time-saving. Jonathan Feniak, General Counsel at LLC Attorney, agrees with my assessment of Filenow’s transparency: “Filenow shines for the transparency they bring to the table. Their pricing is straightforward with no hidden fees, which is refreshing and vital for small businesses needing to budget efficiently. Their tax consultation, included with their services, can be immensely valuable for new business owners looking for additional financial insights.” Filenow’s services start at $49 with the Starter plan plus state filing fees. I opted to sign up for the Premium package, which costs $199 and includes notable features such as a free year of registered agent service, an EIN and an operating agreement. The Starter plan could work for those seeking an immediate and bare-bones start to their LLC creation. Still, the Premium package represents a better value and maintains compliance following your launch. Filenow has a positive reputation among customers, with many of them talking up the company’s straightforward process and transparency. A few people reacted negatively to the process, finding it slower than expected or mentioning a lack of response from the service team. Even then, Filenow representatives made clear attempts to address any dissatisfaction. If you have an issue or any questions, you can get in touch with Filenow’s customer service by phone, email or chat or by completing a contact form on the company’s website. I didn’t directly engage customer support when signing up for the product, but based on my research, most customers can engage a live agent and receive the help they needed. Filenow works by having customers follow the filing process on their website. There is no mobile app currently available.

 Inc Authority helps customers create LLCs and mainly promotes a “free” LLC formation process. The standard package covers processing and filing, verification of business name availability and a year of registered agent service. I went with the no-cost LLC package. After sharing some basic details about the business and its purpose, I was then prompted to either create a new account or log in. I also had the choice to continue as a guest. After continuing, Inc Authority offered a premium add-on for free, with three options: tax audit protection; a free web address, website builder and up to five email addresses; and 24-hour express processing. Toward the end of the process, Inc Authority attempted to upsell me on getting an operating agreement and business banking. When I arrived at the checkout page, I could clearly see everything that came with the LLC filing package and verify exactly what I would be paying for. That said, I did not like that I couldn’t unselect any items I did not want as part of the service. Rather than edit an order, I would need to start everything over again. Inc Authority provides a free base service, so you will only pay your state’s filing fee. Some add-ons will raise your upfront costs. For instance, getting an EIN through Inc Authority costs $50, unless you opt to get it as a free premium gift at checkout. While completing the process, Inc Authority offered me several add-ons. You should keep track of what you include with your package, as some items get charged later. Tommy Mello, an entrepreneur and founder of A1 Garage Door Service, agrees: “Starting a business can be expensive, so the idea of getting off the ground without incurring significant upfront costs is definitely appealing. However, it’s essential to consider any potential add-on fees and whether they align with your needs as a business owner. Overall, Inc Authority seems to offer a budget-friendly option for those just starting out on their entrepreneurial journey.” Two premium packages are available, but the prices aren’t publicly listed, so you must contact Inc Authority directly for pricing information. Inc Authority has many positive reviews, with customers speaking highly of support team members who assisted them with questions and getting through the process. While not accredited with the Better Business Bureau, Inc Authority has a page with a dozen complaints against the company. Unhappy customers stated that they weren’t given clear directions about fees or got spammed repeatedly about add-ons. If you need help, you can connect with Inc Authority by phone, chat or email or submit a general inquiry through the website. I selected a formation package but didn’t complete it, prompting a service team member to contact me to offer additional assistance. Based on my experience, anyone on the fence will likely get the answers they need to decide within an hour of starting the process.

Owners’ personal assets are considered separate from those of the business. Because of this, LLC owners are not personally liable for the business’s debts. LLCs also have tax advantages for some business owners. Forming an LLC can also provide you with a degree of added credibility, as it looks more professional than doing business with an individual. Before you take the plunge and start an LLC, be sure to consider the benefits and drawbacks of doing so. If you’re unsure of whether an LLC makes sense for your unique situation, it’s a good idea to do some research and compare an LLC to other types of business structures, such as C corporations (C-corps), S corporations (S-corps), sole proprietorships and limited liability partnerships (LLPs). Ask an expert Brette Sember, J.D. Contributor Kelly Reilly Editorial Director Valerie Catalano, J.D. Editor The most important reason for forming an LLC is because it protects your personal assets should your business fail or be sued. If you anticipate your business growing to the point where you want investors, they are much easier to obtain if you have an LLC. Additionally, creating an LLC presents a professional appearance for your business. Contributor For certain types of businesses, forming an LLC can help protect you and your assets and create a more favorable tax situation. But it’s not right—or necessary—for all kinds of business owners, so I’d recommend consulting an attorney about what’s best for you. Editorial Director Forming an LLC can shield you personally from business liabilities, and it can also reduce your taxes. But whether an LLC is the right choice for you depends on the specifics of your business, so you should consult with an attorney first.

 LLC State Guides 
 To determine whether an LLC service makes sense for you, keep the following in mind. “Although completing the form to register an LLC might seem easy, having an LLC formation company handle this and other formalities for you can provide a lot of protection. There are lots of mistakes you can make in completing your forms and to correct them you’ll have to file more paperwork and pay more fees. For example, you might mistakenly list one of the members as just a manager when they are actually a member and a manager and you’ll have to amend your filing to correct it. An LLC formation service can help you avoid pitfalls like these. When registered agent service is part of your package, you are able to easily and inexpensively fulfill one of the most important requirements of an LLC—having someone in the state who can receive legal notices. If you list yourself, it is easy to forget to update your address if it changes. This means your LLC could be sued and you wouldn’t have any way to know it, possibly leaving you in default so you lose just by not showing up. If your LLC formation company handles annual reports or notifies you when they are due, it helps you avoid another big mistake. If you miss filing your annual report on time you at the least face fines and could face dissolution of your LLC. An LLC formation company makes sure you complete your papers correctly. If you have the additional features of a registered agent and annual report compliance, you can be certain your LLC is well protected.”
—Brette Sember, J.D. An LLC service is not the only way to form an LLC; the process is straightforward in most states and possible without using (or paying for) a service. However, there are often additional benefits to using an LLC service. Here are some of the key benefits to consider when narrowing down your selection. Some LLC services allow you to choose the package or plan that is the best fit for your particular budget and needs. One of their options may even be free or incredibly inexpensive. Other LLC services only offer one package that may or may not make sense for your unique situation. BetterLegal, for example, offers one package but allows you to tailor it to your needs with a la carte options. With Filenow, you can choose from a few state-specific packages, including the Starter package and Premium package. Their Starter package includes basic features like articles of organization filing and an unlimited name search. While Premium is more than triple the price, it comes with useful extras, like an operating agreement, banking resolution, business contract templates and 24-hour order processing. Some LLC services go the extra mile and offer add-on services, such as registered agent services and business licensing. Other supplementary services may include finance, marketing and branding, web design and compliance reporting. Opt for a service with the add-ons that are most important to you. If you’re a startup on a mission to get your name out there and attract new customers, marketing and branding services are likely important. If you don’t have an in-house team to manage your finances and would like to free yourself of the responsibility, finance and accounting services could be worth it. Ask yourself which areas of your business could use some outside help. Then, look for LLC services with add-on services that you can benefit from. Each LLC service has different offerings and fees, so it’s best to consider which services are required and choose a company that offers those for a reasonable price. Some companies promote “free” services, but what that means is that they have a basic plan that doesn’t add upfront charges on top of state filing fees. Also consider that while some service features, such as a registered agent or compliance assistance, may be provided free of charge through the first year, these ultimately tend to become recurring monthly or annual charges. You should always consider both immediate and long-term charges when creating a budget for LLC formation. The following chart gives an idea of plan pricing and overall costs for each service. LLC stands for “limited liability company” and refers to a type of business structure where your business assets and debts are separate from personal finances. For tax purposes, LLCs are considered pass-through entities, which means there are no corporate income taxes. There is technically no way to form an LLC for free, as you need to pay state filing fees. However, some LLC services do not charge a base fee, which brings down formation costs. Additionally, some states do not charge as much as others, making it more affordable to create an LLC in certain locations. In reviewing some of the most popular and reputable LLC services, the best options worth considering are LegalZoom, ZenBusiness, Rocket Lawyer and Bizee. Currently, Montana is the least expensive state to form an LLC. The filing fee is $35. It is only possible to create a truly anonymous LLC in the state of New Mexico. While a few places, such as Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming, have higher levels of privacy, you are still expected to identify the owner of an LLC to the state.
