The famous '72 Santa Monica recording finally sees light of day A recording from David Bowie‘s North American ‘Ziggy Stardust’ tour is to be made available as a double album on June 30. The show, recorded at the Los Angeles Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 20, 1972 has been a famous bootlegged album from the Ziggy Stardust era Bowie. As it was his first live FM Radio broadcasted concert in the US, hundreds of good quality bootlegs became available. This new double disc and vinyl live album through EMI is the first official release of the Santa Monica show, after an attempt by label Golden Years to issue the bootleg in 1994.   The original show was attended by 3, 000 fans, and is said to have captured David Bowie at his peak, and through the radio broadcast broken him to the US market. Speaking to Uncut sister title NME, Bowie said of the recording: “I can tell that I’m totally into being Ziggy by this stage of our touring. It’s no longer an act; I am him. He added: “This would be around the tenth American show for us and you can hear that we are all pretty high on ourselves. We train wreck a couple of things, I miss some words and sometimes you wouldn’t know that pianist Mike Garson was onstage with us but overall I really treasure this bootleg. Mick Ronson is at his blistering best.” The full tracklist for ‘David Bowie, Live Santa Monica ’72’ is: ‘Introduction’ ‘Hang On To Yourself’ ‘Ziggy Stardust’ ‘Changes’ ‘The Supermen’ ‘Life On Mars?’ ‘Five Years’ ‘Space Oddity’ ‘Andy Warhol’ ‘My Death’ ‘The Width Of A Circle’ ‘Queen Bitch’ ‘Moonage Daydream’ ‘John, I’m Only Dancing’ ‘I’m Waiting For The Man’ ‘The Jean Genie’ ‘Suffragette City’ ‘Rock ‘N’ Roll Suicide’ Subscribe to Uncut today and never miss an issue.
