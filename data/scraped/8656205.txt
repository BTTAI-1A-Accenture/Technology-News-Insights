 Join me on a journey to explore the world of sustainable and regenerative investing and discover the funding options available for your regenerative, sustainable, or circular business! As we embark on sustainable entrepreneurship, accessing the right funding becomes crucial to bringing our regenerative ventures to life. The categorization of funds in the fields of sustainable, regenerative, and impact investing can vary, and there is no standardized classification. The precise categorization and terminology may vary depending on the region, investment philosophy, and fund goals.  Let's review some common categories or approaches used to classify these funds, in addition to reputable funds within each category. It's imperative to note that these categories may overlap, and some funds may incorporate multiple strategies or approaches. Additionally, fund managers may use different terminology and specific criteria.  If you're ready to explore funding options for your regenerative or sustainable business, I invite you to first examine how your business model is strategically designed to convince and engage investors. Understanding the main factors and criteria that investors are looking for is crucial.  Stay connected with us at Business Models Inc., where we provide valuable insights and support on designing business models that resonate with sustainable investors. Together, let's unlock the funding opportunities that will drive your regenerative vision forward.
