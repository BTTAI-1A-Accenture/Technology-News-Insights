Summer in Tokyo is defined by festivals and one of the most spectacular is the Bon Odori dance, which takes place in several neighbourhoods across the city. Originally a way to honour the spirits of the dead, Bon Odori is now a fun, engaging family-friendly affair. The celebration at Tsukiji Hongwanji fromÂ July 31Â to August 3 is one of Tokyoâ€™s most popular Bon Odori festivals. So don a yukata and join in the dancing crowd circling the yagura stage from 7pm to 9pm (6pm to 8.30pm on Saturday). Not to worry if you donâ€™t know the steps â€“ just mimic the dance moves of the locals next to you. The festival is also famous for its delectable food selection, so go early and dance up an appetite for a feast.
