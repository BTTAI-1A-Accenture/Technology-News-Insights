Ballerina Without Arms Stuns on AMERICA’S GOT TALENT By Movieguide® Contributor Brazilian Ballerina Vitoria Bueno captured the world when she performed a stunning performance on AMERICAS GOT TALENT.  Despite being born with a congenital defect that left her without arms, Bueno found her way in the world and hasn’t let her disability hold her back.   Bueno told Reuters, “For me, arms, they’re just a detail. I don’t feel like I need them at all.”  Bueno can do things with her feet that many can’t do with their hands.   “It’s super normal for me to do things with my feet,” Bueno shared on America’s Got Talent. “I eat with my feet. I brush my teeth. I fix my hair. I live with my disability.”   A post shared by Vitória Bueno | Bailarina 🩰🇧🇷 (@vihb_bailarina)  Bueno received a standing ovation from the judges and audience.   CBN News reported, “You’re beautiful and you have so much poise, so much elegance,” said Heidi Klum. “When you dance it was so beautiful to watch and thank you for that.”  “I believe the sign of a star is someone who perseveres and then when they are on stage they light up the stage and you have both of those things,” Simon Cowell expressed. “I think the whole of Brazil and the whole of America is going to be rooting for you. You are an all-star.”  “I don’t know that much about dancing,” Howie Mandel proclaimed. “But to be en pointe without arms makes it that much harder to balance and we didn’t even see a second of faltering. It’s amazing the amount of strength and elegance that you put in.”  Bueno walks with her held head high knowing she’s living the life she is meant to live.   She told Reuters, “We are more than our disabilities, so we have to chase our dreams.”   Bueno told the Epoch Times that “We know that the walk is often not easy at all, but we have the option to move forward or give up. Regardless of the difficulty, we have to make an effort, and dedicate ourselves to always do our best. We can do anything but give up!”   A post shared by Vitória Bueno | Bailarina 🩰🇧🇷 (@vihb_bailarina)  Movieguide® is a 501c3 non-profit.
