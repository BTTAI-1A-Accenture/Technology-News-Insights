Even during challenging times for the airline, when the Indian skies were dominated by the IndiGo blues, Air India aircraft have consistently stood out.

From Tata Airlines in 1932 to our emblem adorned with the wheel of Konark, each logo takes shape of a fabled chapter in our journey. #TreasuresOfAI #TBT #ThrowbackThursday pic.twitter.com/tvzCBLyuQv A significant part of this enduring distinction is owed to the iconic logo that has journeyed through time, evolving along with the airline since its inception in 1932 as "TATA AIR LINES." The bold and enduring alphabets of this branding continue to be a prominent feature of its logo to this day. Notably, in 1946, a significant addition was made to the logo in the form of a well-known centaur emblem in a striking shade of red when the airline was officially established as Air India. Elements of this emblem still grace its aircraft today, representing the enduring pride of the Maharaja.
