A huge change has landed at a Wawa location in Philadelphia. At the company’s University City neighborhood store, located on Drexel University’s campus, shoppers won’t be taking items off the shelves any longer because there aren’t any shelves. Instead, customers will use digital touch screens at the store or Wawa’s mobile app to place orders, according to 6ABC. Wawa associates will be working behind the counter. According to Wawa spokesperson Lori Bruce, the new format is currently in test mode and the company plans to gather feedback from customers and employees. “This will allow busy customers to place their orders and get their purchases faster than ever — fulfilled by friendly Wawa associates,” Bruce said to The Inquirer. Note that coffee will remain self-serve, but everything else will be ordered digitally. The store was closed for six days to complete the renovations and reopened on July 26.
