Fans have raised eyebrows and questions about the club's lack of a steady kit, with recent appearances in various jerseys ranging from unbranded to big names like Umbro. 10:25 - 25.09.2023 Kenyan footballers increasingly turn to bhang and stimulants for performance, risking health and careers, amidst a backdrop of unawareness and penalties. After their recent 1-0 loss to Ulinzi Stars, where the team donned an unbranded jersey bearing only the team logo, and a previous match against Posta Rangers in an Umbro jersey, fans took to social media platforms to voice their confusion and dissatisfaction. A vocal critic, Tifow Adaa Adenko, expressed his dismay on the club's Facebook page saying, “Sofapaka Familia, indeed you are a very confused team, full of jokers. How are you playing in the Kenya top flight league yet you lack official kits [(like street teams)]? At times [Umbro], at times [Adidas]! Sometimes [Kappa from Eastleigh]!!! You can't perform like this. Even if fans wanted to promote the team, where would we start surely?” 08:00 - 25.09.2023 Gor Mahia coach acknowledges Homeboyz's strength in a fiercely contested 1-1 showdown at Bukhungu Stadium. In response, the club's social media team retorted, "Tifow Adaa Adenko, are you bringing this up because we lost a match? As you are aware, we do not have an official partner or sponsor and therefore we make do with what we have. Yes we lost a match, but what has the jersey got to do with it?” This back-and-forth encapsulates the bigger issue that Sofapaka is grappling with. The club, once a powerhouse, seems to be a shadow of its former self. Adenko nostalgically commented, “Sofapaka Familia, this is not the Sofapaka we knew 20 years ago. It's so sad; prezida anachoma [president is not doing good]. Hizi ni Dalili za Team kuisha [These are signs of the team ending]. Dalili za mvua [Signs of rain]→→ Sofapaka Familia." 15:39 - 24.09.2023 Kenya national football team, Harambee Stars,  prepares to face 2018 World Cup hosts Russia in a high-stakes friendly as World Cup qualifiers loom. Understanding the pain points of their ardent supporters, the club tried to offer a glimpse into the hardships they face.  "It is expensive to run a club in Kenya without sponsorships. The president is doing his level best but he and the entire club depend on your support. Usichoke na sisi, we will rise, the team will rise. Better days are coming. Keep supporting us,” the club earnestly replied. 10:11 - 25.09.2023 Kipchoge clocked 2:02:42 to win the race and his time was a bit slower than his world record time which stands at 2:01:09. At the heart of this controversy is Sofapaka's loss of their shirt sponsor, Betika. A relationship that began in 2017 with a two-year contract saw multiple renewals until August 2022. Unfortunately, Betika chose not to continue their five-year cumulative partnership, leaving Sofapaka in the lurch. This decision has taken a significant toll on the club. Without a steady stream of sponsorship money, last season saw players facing hardships, with delayed salaries for months on end. 12:56 - 19.08.2024 Enzo Maresca's endured a nightmare start as Chelsea boss.
