 There's a lot of ways of achieving any given goal. Legal, accessibility and moral considerations to one side for a moment, it doesn't really matter how you get to where you want to be, as long as it works for you.  I keep saying this because some people think there is a canonical 'right' way of working. There are some very popular content creation tools out there that never really worked for me. I know they're popular, but they're not for me. And if you are the one doing your work, your own ways of working and preferences become super important. I want to call out a couple of cool people I've seen MacGyvering solutions lately.  Trevor van Woerden ♨️ recently moved from Restream to StreamYard for The Hotness Unleasher Show. One thing Trevor likes to do is have the whole chat on screen. This was pretty straight forward in Restream, but StreamYard don't offer this functionality. (Indeed StreamYard support told him it wasn't possible.) But he embraced his inner MacGyver and found himself a paperclip in the form of OBS Studio.  He's bringing the chat into OBS Studio and then using the Virtual Camera to show that as a second camera within StreamYard.  Cher Jones, host of Your Brand At Work, was doing her LinkedIn Live events in OBS Studio exclusively, but bringing in native LinkedIn Live chat comments is not really a simple task. (I have actually documented a way of doing this via Restream Chat and Social Stream Ninja, but this requires a number of steps.) She took what she was doing and recreated it in Restream Studio. The point is there are all kinds of opportunities to think outside (the cliché of) the box. Technology is pretty forgiving. Prod it until it gives you what you want.  Content creators can be really self-conscious about repeating themselves. They’ll say things like, “But I told people about this back in February 2018. I can’t post it again.” You can —and should— repeat yourself. But even more than that, you need to work smarter. And part of that involves creating a content library. Episode 17 of Build A Presentation Muscle podcast, Content Libraries and Repeating Yourself, is out now.

OBS Studio is free and open source software for livestreaming, video recording and changing how you show up on webcam in any application on your computer.  OBS Studio is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.  You can do entire broadcast quality livestreams within OBS Studio if you want. But I don't think that's the feature most people need.  The Virtual Camera lets you change how you look on camera.  I started using it as a way of dealing with the green screen that is behind me all of the time. But I quickly realised that there were all kinds of opportunities for branding and calls to action.  I can add my brand colours, images, logos, text, calls to action, website URLs, promotional messages and QR codes inside my webcam frame.  And it doesn't matter what software I'm using. It could be practically anything.  Microsoft Teams Zoom Skype  Restream Studio  StreamYard  Google Meet I can easily toggle the visibility of any of these elements with a mouse click, keyboard shortcut or (if you're feeling particularly fancy) the press of a button on your Elgato Stream Deck.  To use the Virtual Camera:  In OBS Studio, click the Start Virtual Camera button in the controls section.  In your software of choice, select OBS Virtual Camera as your Camera.
