Today the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa held their annual State of the Band address. Held  at Fortune Bay Resort Casino the event served as a chance  for communication. “We expect about 200 people today at our event. And again, like I said, it’s been a long time coming since we’ve had a chance to get together and see each other. And you can just hear the laughter and hear the talking and and the smiles and seeing our elders that are here and our drum group and everything. It’s just it’s just a wonderful time,” says Cathy Chavers Chair of the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa. The program began with a welcome by Executive  Director Luke Warnsholz, followed by a ceremonial drum performance and an opening blessing. There were introductions and video remarks from senators as well. One key thing Chairperson  Chavers made clear was the community effort. “We’ve shown that we can take care of our members and take care of our programs and services with limited funding, because we are always fighting for funding. But since since the pandemic, we’ve done a great job as tribal leaders and tribes and making sure that our services are met and our and our tribal members have their needs met,” continues Chavers. And Chavers is clear things are not without challenges. “Certainly there are challenges, as we have in communities all over the state, but this community is really blessed with so many assets and to be able to see that all come together is a great thing,” finishes Chavers.
