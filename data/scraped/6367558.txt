TikTokers with dinged-up cars were shocked when a simple DIY recipe seemingly removed every scratch on a woman’s vehicle — and now the footage is going viral. Sydney Hess (@derp.central) gained over 11.3 million views, 928,000 likes, 164,000 saves and 2,900 comments when she uploaded the car hack to her account. But much like with the paper towel storage hack that recently went viral, some people are questioning whether Hess’s hack really works — and if the ingredients pose any harm to a car’s top coat. “So I saw this thing on here saying that if you mix white vinegar and then coconut oil, you can take scratches out of your car,” Hess’s video begins. She then reveals the back of her car, the bumper of which is covered in scratches and dings. “I got plenty of scratches to try this on,” she says. Armed with a paper towel, she kneels to apply the coconut oil and vinegar solution to the bumper. “I really don’t think this is going to work.” But to her surprise, the scratches seemingly disappear. “Oh my God it actually works!” Hess goes on to apply the solution to other spots on her car — and even uploads a part two to buff the headlights and door handle areas. Other TikTokers quickly jumped on Hess’s viral discovery, like @notjustbored_, whose video coverage inspired users like Uwineza Julie (@uwinezajulie) to also test the hack out on their own car. “*Makes note to do this before selling my car to a dealership*,” commented @shelby01150. “OMGGGGGGGGGG. I just scratched my husbands truck today. I’m gonna do it and if it takes off later … he will think it was during HIS watch 😁😅” wrote @viv1080. “Oh I HAVE TO TRY THIS,” commented @daniellelenaeee. While the coconut oil and vinegar recipe does seem to work, it appears that it will do so only on superficial scratches and scuffs in the top coat — and it’s not a permanent fix. In a later update, Hess revealed that not only were many of the scratches visible again — and her headlights were back to being foggy — but also the solution had had a surprising effect on bugs. While many TikTokers were floored by how well the solution worked on superficial scuffs, many expressed concern about the ingredients’ impact on cars’ top coat and paint. According to My Car Makes Noise, the acidity in vinegar could eat away at a car’s outer layer of paint and remove its clear coat and any wax applied to the exterior. Thus, if it’s used to remove stuck-on debris or tough-to-clean stains, it should always be diluted — and dried and removed immediately after use to avoid damaging the paint. As for coconut oil, while it can be effective in cleaning and adding shine, Auto Care Aids recommends using products and scratch removers that are made specifically for cars.

In the long-running "Alien" movie franchise, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation can’t seem to let go of a terrible idea: It keeps trying to make a profit from xenomorphs -- creatures with acid for blood and a penchant for violently bursting out of human hosts.  Sadly, as much as I liked “Alien: Romulus” (and I liked it a lot!), the new sequel (or "interquel") can’t escape a terrible idea of its own: Hollywood’s fixation on using CGI to de-age or resurrect beloved actors.  “Alien: Romulus” tries to pull off a similar trick — while it doesn't resurrect the exact same murderous android from the original “Alien,” it features an identical model, seemingly played by the same actor, Ian Holm, who died in 2020.
