On Sunday, members of the Loveland community remembered and honored a Loveland High School graduate while raising awareness about mental health and suicide. Ben Morrison was a student-athlete at Loveland High School, who graduated in 2020. Morrison died suddenly the following year. On Sunday, family and friends gathered for the second annual "Ben's Birthday Bash" at Fowling Warehouse. The celebration was a chance to pay tribute to the former football and lacrosse player, with all proceeds going toward the Ben Morrison Fund. "We need to not hide it. We nee to let people know, because we can't save our children if were not talking about it," Ben's mother Tori Morrison said." I've talked to other people and it's all about starting conversations." The fund is dedicated to erasing the stigma around mental health and creating lifelines to help reach young people who are in crisis.  "As a parent, I think that if I had been given the opportunity, if my son had ever come to me and said he needed help, I hope that I would've been the parent that would've gotten him help," Tori Morrison said.  Since the death of her son, Tori has made it her mission to erase the stigma around mental health. She has visited high schools to let students know help is available. "If I go to a school and I talk and hand out free stuff, if I spend $200 on a bunch of pens and one of those pens makes a kid think, it was worth it," Tori said.
