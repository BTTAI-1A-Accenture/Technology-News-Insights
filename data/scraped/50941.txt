As autumn approaches, patches of farmland in Heilongjiang province are turning golden and farmers are looking forward to another bumper harvest. After high-quality tillage preparation, high-standard spring tillage and fine field management, wheat, early-maturing rice and fresh corn are now being harvested and stored in the warehouse. The harvest of soybeans and late-maturing rice is in sight. Last year, Heilongjiang saw a grain harvest of 77.6 million metric tons, accounting for 11.3 percent of the national total, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. With a pristine ecology and one of the world's largest black soil zones, Heilongjiang leads the country in the amount of land devoted to planting rice, corn and soybeans, and has the nation's highest annual yield.
