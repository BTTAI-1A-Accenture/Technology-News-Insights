JD Wetherspoon is the latest operator to join the O2 leisure development on London's Finchley Road. Wetherspoon will occupy the former Babe Ruth's unit on Level 1 of the centre, close to the 8-screen Warner Village Cinema. Other operators at the north London complex, attracting more than seven million visitors a year, include Yo! Sushi, Pizza Hut, Nando's, Bar Circa and Mezzanine's Smollensky's restaurant brand. A spokesperson for O2's owner, O2 General Partners, welcomes the new addition: We are delighted that JD Wetherspoon is to join the tenant line-up. It will provide yet another great meeting place for people. Work on the site, expected to open this summer, begins next month.
