Banks — Shares of U.S. banks fell as investors worried about the global banking system. First Republic Bank fell 3%, while Western Alliance, Zions Bancorporation and Fifth Third all lost more than 2%. Large banks weren't immune from traders' skittishness. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America were down 2% as well. Block — The payment company slid 1.9%, a day after losing nearly 15% when short seller Hindenburg Research alleged that Block facilitates fraud.

Coinbase — Investors put more pressure onto shares of the cryptocurrency exchange early Friday. The stock ticked down 2.3% in premarket trading, a day after the company disclosed it received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The disclosure pushed the stock down more than 14% on Thursday. Year to date, the stock is still up 87% this year.

Halliburton, Occidental Petroleum, Diamondback Energy and Exxon Mobil each lost about 2%.

The FDA has said it can't approve the company's application in its present form. Scholastic — Shares of the children's book publisher fell 13% after the company reported a decline in revenue for its fiscal third quarter from the previous year and lowered its financial guidance for the full year.
