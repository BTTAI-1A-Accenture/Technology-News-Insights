Hudson Institute’s Center on Europe and Eurasia is dedicated to advancing American interests and revitalizing our alliances for today’s era of great power competition. Under the direction of Senior Fellow Peter Rough, the center’s work will focus on checking Russia’s military aggression in Ukraine, countering China’s subversion of the continent, extricating Europe from strategic vulnerabilities, forging key links in Central Asia, and modernizing our transatlantic military posture and economic ties. It is crucial to America’s success that Europe is prepared to oppose both Russian and Chinese aggression. Leveraging our allies will require creative leadership from the United States. The Center on Europe and Eurasia brings together leaders, officials, lawmakers, and key stakeholders to advance policies that serve the American interest and the future of the transatlantic alliance.  A Message from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg
