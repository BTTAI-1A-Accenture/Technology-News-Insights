NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Allied Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGAE) (the “Company” or “AGAE”), a global experiential entertainment company, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023.

  
“It has been a strong start to the year so far at Allied and we are continuing to gain momentum in the second quarter as we advance on our strategic objectives,” said Yinghua Chen, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are also excited to have recently announced our continued relationship with HyperX/HP on the Arena branding side and renewal of sponsorship from Progressive Insurance on our original content programs. These growing relationships are further evidence that Allied is recognized as an established name in the gaming entertainment community and that we offer an inroad to this crucial and fast-growing multi-billion-dollar gaming marketplace.”

 
First Quarter 2023 Financial Results
 
Revenues: Total revenues of $1.2 million were relatively flat from the fourth quarter of 2022, and down from $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022. The year-over-year decline was primarily attributable to the timing of the Company’s original content series, ELEVATED, which recognized revenues for Season 1 in the first quarter of 2022 and is expected to recognize revenues for Season 2 in the second quarter of 2023.

 
Costs and expenses: Total costs and expenses were $3.8 million, a decrease of 38% compared to the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was in large part due to a 26% reduction in general & administrative expenses, principally cash, severance and stock-based compensation, as well as the aforementioned timing and related expense recognition of ELEVATED.
 
Net loss for the first quarter of 2023 was $1.9 million compared to a net loss of $3.8 million in the prior year period. Net loss in the first quarter of 2023 includes approximately $734,000 of interest income earned on short-term investments.

 
Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2023, a 20% reduction from a loss of $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022. A reconciliation of the GAAP-basis net loss to adjusted EBITDA is provided in the table at the end of this press release.

 
Balance Sheet
 
As of March 31, 2023, the Company had a cash and short-term investments position of $84.4 million, including $5.0 million of restricted cash. This compared to $86.8 million in cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2022, which also included $5.0 million of restricted cash. At March 31, 2023, the Company had a working capital position of $75.6 million compared to $79.1 million at December 31, 2022. AGAE’s working capital positions on March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were reduced by operating lease liabilities of $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, recorded in connection with the Company’s implementation of the new leasing standard (ASC 842) on December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, the Company had approximately 39.1 million shares of outstanding common stock.

 
During the first quarter, the Company bought back a total of 1.1 million shares of its common stock at an average selling price of $1.26 for a total cost of $1.43 million, excluding broker fees. Moving forward, the manner, timing and amount of any purchases will continue to be based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors.

 
Operational Update
 
Allied Esports produced 82 events in the first quarter of 2023, with 42 proprietary events and 40 third-party events. Third-party events were up 5.3% compared to the first quarter of 2022 and were highlighted by the View Sonic CES Event, the HyperX CES Event, Nighthawk Pictures Production, ReliaQuest, and Astral Clash.

 
The Allied Esports mobile arena was also active with six events during the quarter, including the 2023 Cotton Bowl Classic in Arlington, Texas; the Feld Motorsports eSX Finals in Los Angeles, California; the AIM Sports Volleyball SoCal Cup in Seal Beach, California; The Clash at the Coliseum NASCAR Race in Los Angeles, California; Superbowl LVII in Phoenix, Arizona; and NHL Stadium Series in Raleigh, North Carolina.

 
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, AGAE announced that AE Studios, its content development, storytelling and production services arm, will produce the second season of ELEVATED, Presented by Progressive Insurance, for a total of ten episodes. Season 2 premiered on May 3, 2023 on various creator channels from One True King (OTK), one of the most watched content organizations on Twitch.

 
Also subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company announced the extension of its exclusive naming rights agreement with HyperX/HP, which ensures that AGAE’s flagship arena will remain known as HyperX Arena Las Vegas. HyperX/HP will continue to receive prominent branding and signage inside and outside of the venue, as well as partner with AGAE on a variety of co-branded experiences and events at the arena. In addition, as part of the expansion of the agreement, HP Omen will now sponsor the Allied Mobile Esports Truck as well.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
As a supplement to our financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company presents certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as more important than, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with the company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to the Company’s GAAP financial results and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies.

 
The Company provides net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company provides EBITDA (defined as GAAP net income (loss) from continuing operations before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization). The Company defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA excluding certain non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, inducement expense, extinguishment losses and impairment losses.

 
In the future, the Company may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure the Company’s financial and operating performance. In particular, these measures facilitate comparison of our operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of the Company by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company’s core business, operating results, or future outlook. Additionally, we consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, along with others, in assessing the Company’s operating results, measuring compliance with any applicable requirements of the Company’s debt financing agreements in place at such time, as well as in planning and forecasting.

 
The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and our non-GAAP definitions of the “EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA” do not have a standardized meaning. Therefore, other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but include or exclude different items, which may not provide investors a comparable view of the Company’s performance in relation to other companies.

 
Management compensates for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of these items by considering the impact of the items separately and by considering the Company’s GAAP, as well as non-GAAP, financial results and outlook, and by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures directly ahead of non-GAAP measures, and by providing a reconciliation that indicates and describes the adjustments made.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss) or any other performance measure derived in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of AGAE’s profitability or liquidity. AGAE’s management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow external users of its financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to more effectively evaluate its operating performance, compare the results of its operations from period to period and against AGAE’s peers without regard to AGAE’s financing methods, hedging positions or capital structure and because it highlights trends in AGAE’s business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures. AGAE presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures of its performance that are frequently used by others in evaluating companies in its industry. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA AGAE presents may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. AGAE defines “EBITDA” as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of intangibles. AGAE defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, gain on forgiveness of PPP loans, transaction costs and other charges related to the sale of WPT, impairment losses, conversion inducement expenses and extinguishment losses.

 
The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net loss from continuing operations, AGAE’s most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.
