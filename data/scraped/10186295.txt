SHANGHAI, May 6 (SMM) - As of April 28, nickel ore arrivals at Chinese ports totalled 660,000 wmt, up 8% WoW, with more goods arriving at Ningde and Yangjiang ports. Nickel ore quotes stabilised this week, but the ore traders intended to raise their prices as the NPI prices were on the rise. The mines in the Philippines are resuming operation slowly, and thus it is expected that the ore arrivals will increase in early May.
