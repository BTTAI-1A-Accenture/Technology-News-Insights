 ERP describes the process of analyzing business functions for increased efficiency and productivity. Companies have long sought to streamline business processes through the consolidation of internal data. The use of centralized ERP software has revolutionized the way these goals are carried out by integrating once-separate systems. As much as ever, ERP remains a data-driven approach to consolidating and improving business functions. Modern systems, however, afford a greater degree of simplicity, organization and automation to the employees and business leaders responsible for day-to-day operations. At the core of any ERP system is a central database that’s shared by the many disparate elements of a company. Rather than having separate data collection and management programs for each department—one for sales, one for inventory management, another for production, and so on—an ERP system provides a single hub for it all. ERP systems are not just for massive companies—although they have become particularly essential to large, sprawling organizations. Small businesses, including independent retailers and services, may also find ERP software to provide valuable support. Any business that strives for accurate data collection can benefit from EPR systems, including all businesses that wish to track sales, inventory and finances. ERP is especially popular in manufacturing and production-based fields, but it is now used in areas as wide-ranging as healthcare, e-commerce and nonprofit work. Featured Partner 1 Inventory Planner by Sage $249.99/month No Forecasting, purchasing, reporting, analytics 1 Inventory Planner by Sage On Inventory Planner's Website 2 SYSPRO Yes Yes Yes 2 SYSPRO On SYSPRO's Website With a consolidated database as its foundation, ERP systems can be built out to accomplish a seemingly limitless variety of management and tracking functions. Doing so still requires technical know-how from a third-party ERP system provider or experienced internal staff, but it’s much, much easier for the company at large than the siloed management software systems of the past. Employees usually interact with an ERP system through a centralized dashboard connected to the core database. This puts access to real-time information from various parts of the company at employee fingertips any time it’s needed. ERP systems may operate and store information on-site or, increasingly, in the cloud. The most noteworthy advantages of ERP systems include: When evaluating an ERP system that’s best for your organization, consider core features, cost, the demo and implementation: Expect to spend upward of $9,000 per user per month for your ERP system. The total cost of the ERP system itself ranges from $1,740 per month on average for small businesses to $9,330 per month for enterprises. These figures don’t include per-user fees or the cost of implementation, training and maintenance. Factors that impact cost include customization, number of users and the number of modules you want to incorporate into the ERP. Pricing models vary, depending on the type of ERP system you’re exploring, whether on-premise, cloud or hybrid. Pricing models may be license-based (typical for on-premise solutions), flat monthly or annual fees, or monthly or annual per-user fees. Some vendors stack these fees, combining a flat monthly or annual fee with a per-user cost. Prior to a demo, give the vendor representative a chance to thoroughly prepare by providing sample data along with all business requirements. The demo should be personalized to your unique business needs and goals, not a canned demo presentation. Prepare an ERP scorecard beforehand that you’ll use to evaluate each of the top picks according to the same key criteria. Also, ask to see desired functions and capabilities in action during the demo. Don’t simply take the representative’s word for it. Consider the time, cost and scope of resources necessary for ERP implementation before making your final choice. Implementing a new ERP can take six months to over two years. Moreover, will you need to hire an implementation consultant, or does the vendor provide implementation support? If so, at what stages of implementation, and what is the cost? Implementing ERP software typically costs twice as much as the software alone. To determine the best ERP systems in the market, Forbes Advisor considered over 20 of the leading providers in the space and narrowed it down to the top 16 providers. These were then analyzed across five primary categories for a total of 25 different metrics. We then weighted each of the overarching categories based on what matters most to businesses. Here are the metrics we used to evaluate the top ERP systems. The best ERP systems are affordable and offer a high value for the price. So we considered pricing, as well as contract lengths, scalability, and the availability of free trials and money-back guarantees. We placed an emphasis on the key features that matter most to businesses seeking an ERP system. For example, we considered whether the systems are cloud-based for accessibility, on-premises ERP, warehouse management, accounting, real-time updates, reporting and analytics and software integrations for maximum flexibility. In addition to the key, must-have features, we also considered the unique offerings of each of the best ERP systems. This includes factors such as automation, budgeting and financial management, CRM features, forecasting, HR functionalities, supply chain management and features designed to meet the needs of manufacturers. To get a deeper understanding of what real users think of the systems, we looked at third-party user reviews and ratings. This metric considers not only the average ratings across numerous rating sites but also the number of reviews each provider has to ensure the rating is reflective of a broad user base. Our final metric considers our own first-hand experience and expertise. This factors in qualitative metrics, such as value for the price, ease of use, support quality and popularity. In general, there are three different types of ERP systems. These include cloud-based, on-premise and hybrid solutions. Each ERP system has its own set of modules. The most common ones, however, include finance, manufacturing, procurement, inventory management, warehouse management and CRM. ERP systems serve as “air traffic control” for business management, centralizing the data and analytics that power a successful, modern enterprise. Without an ERP system, departments within a company tend to build up separate data management structures and software systems, each one addressing a different facet of business operations in what’s called a “siloed” or “unintegrated” approach. Alternatively, ERP systems provide a consolidated, streamlined platform through which all parts of a company can share information easily and develop company-wide solutions. While business management only increases in complexity as a company grows, many smaller businesses still find ERP software to be essential in 2024. Even local, mom-and-pop businesses still juggle a variety of business elements such as accounting, inventory management, payroll and sales. Of any type of business, small ones likely have the least bandwidth to devote to analyzing and optimizing these various elements, making them a good candidate for an ERP system.
