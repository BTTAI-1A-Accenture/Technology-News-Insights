After assigning a weighted value to each data point, we calculated a score for each bar POS system. We then named the bar POS systems with the highest scores the best bar POS systems of 2024. For pricing, we rated a provider’s pricing plan based on whether we considered it to be cheap, fair or expensive, with those bar POS systems coming in on the lower end of the price scale achieving a higher ranking in this metric. We also gave bonus points to those providers that offered a free version of their POS system or at least a free trial period. Additionally, we considered how much each provider charged for credit card processing fees and other fees related to taking credit cards, such as chargebacks and accepting foreign currencies. Pricing accounted for 35% of our weighted scoring. While our reviews mention a variety of features attractive to bars, we maintained consistency in our ratings by looking for these specific features for each provider. These included providing all of the necessary hardware to set up the bar POS system, having bar-specific features, offering inventory management capabilities, the ability to take mobile payments, offering built-in payment processing and integrating with third-party software programs. We weighted features at 35% of our total score. Looking at customer reviews on certain third-party review websites, our experts came up with a rating system that focused on factors not covered in the categories mentioned above. Some of these factors include the POS system’s ease of use, its popularity among users, any detailed or stand-out features that may separate one or more bar POS systems from the others and the value each one offered for the cost. This final analysis by our experts made up 30% of the total score. If you want to accept credit and debit cards, then you’ll need a POS system.
