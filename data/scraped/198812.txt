Amplitude (AMPL – Research Report), the Technology sector company, was revisited by a Wall Street analyst on September 22. Analyst Robert Oliver from Robert W. Baird maintained the rating on the stock to a Hold and gave it a $13.00 price target. Robert Oliver has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors that are impacting Amplitude’s financial performance. The ongoing macroeconomic pressures are persistently causing small-medium business (SMB) churn and down renewal rates, particularly in the Technology, Media, and Telecommunications (TMT) sector. This situation is expected to persist into the first half of 2024. While the company’s moves towards profitability improvements and changes in the Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy are positive, the challenge of leading in an emerging category during a period of budget constraint is recognized. Thus, signs of stabilization are awaited before reassessing the company’s position. In addition, Oliver has revised down the 2024 revenue growth estimate for Amplitude to 9.6%, which is below the Street’s expectation of 10.7%. This revision, driven by the ongoing macro headwinds and pressure on renewals, impacts the future financial outlook for the company. The 2025 revenue growth estimate is set at 14.8% year-over-year, which is also below the consensus of 19.5%. Despite these challenges, management remains confident in the firm’s competitive position and long-term opportunity. However, the current economic environment continues to pressure SMBs, which make up approximately 20% of Amplitude’s customer base. For this reason, Oliver advises maintaining a Hold position until signs of market stabilization emerge. According to TipRanks, Oliver is a 5-star analyst with an average return of 8.6% and a 53.50% success rate. Oliver covers the Technology sector, focusing on stocks such as Verisign, Zuora, and Couchbase. See Insiders’ Hot Stocks on TipRanks >>
