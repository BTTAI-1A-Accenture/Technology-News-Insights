Regulatory News:
 
POXEL SA POXEL POXEL, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for serious chronic diseases with metabolic pathophysiology, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare metabolic disorders, today announced its results for the year ended December 31, 2022 and provided a corporate update.
 
"This past September marked the anniversary of the first year of commercialization of TWYMEEG, our first approved drug, for type-2-diabetes patients in Japan. We have observed a strong growth trajectory in sales in the past few months, that led our partner to increase its full year 2022 forecast by 20%, and also gives us better visibility on our future royalties and royalty rate, which we expect will increase to 10% during Sumitomo Pharma's fiscal year 2024. The year has also been important for Poxel''s development, as we completed our Phase II study in NASH for PXL065, with positive results that opens the way to further development with potential partners. There have been several positive developments in NASH over the past few months, and it is very encouraging for the field, as there still is no approved medicine for patients," stated Thomas Kuhn, Chief Executive Officer of Poxel. "Given the momentum of TWYMEEG sales and the potential of our development pipeline, we are pleased that the successful restructuring of our debt, concurrently with a new equity-linked financing, will significantly extend our cash runway through Q2 2025. We are actively working to finalize other additional financing, including ongoing partnership discussions, to be able to advance our rare diseases strategy, starting with our ALD studies."

Poxel reported revenues of EUR 0.674 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to EUR 13.4 million during the corresponding period in 2021, which mainly reflected the EUR 13.2 million milestone payment for the approval of TWYMEEG in Japan on June 23, 2021.
 
Revenue for 2022 mainly consists of JPY 95 million (EUR 0.673 million) of royalty revenue from Sumitomo Pharma which represents 8% of TWYMEEG net sales in Japan. Based on its current forecast, Poxel expects to receive 8% royalties on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan through the Sumitomo Pharma fiscal year 2022 (April 2022 to March 2023). As part of the Merck Serono licensing agreement, Poxel will pay Merck Serono a fixed 8% royalty based on the net sales of Imeglimin, independent of the level of sales.
 
Cost of sales amounted to EUR 0.672 million, corresponding to the 8% royalties on net sales of Imeglimin in Japan due to Merck Serono, as part of the Merck Serono license agreement.
 
R&D expenses totaled EUR 12.4 million in 2022, as compared to EUR 25.2 million in 2021. R&D expenses in 2022 primarily reflect the clinical study costs incurred for the Phase 2 DESTINY-1 study evaluating PXL065 in NASH.
 
R&D costs are net of the R&D Tax Credit (CIR) and other subsidies that resulted in income of EUR 1.5 million in 2022, as compared to EUR 2.3 million in 2021.
 
General and administrative expenses totaled EUR 9.4 million in 2022, as compared to EUR 10.6 million in 2021.
 
The financial loss amounted to EUR 9.5 million in 2022, as compared to a loss of EUR 1.3 million in 2021. It primarily reflects the interests and fees attached to the Company indebtedness.
 
The net result for the financial period ending December 31, 2022 was a net loss of EUR 31.4 million, as compared to a net loss of EUR 23.8 million in 2021.
 
Cash
 
As of December 31, 2022, total cash and cash equivalents were EUR 13,1 million (USD 14 million)5 as compared to EUR 32.3 million at December 31, 2021.
