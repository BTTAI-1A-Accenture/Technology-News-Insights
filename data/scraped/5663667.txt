Don’t fret if you’re not willing to invest real-life money into V-Bucks because there’s a tonne of AoT gear that can be unlocked without expense. Specifically, completing the Eren Jaeger Battle Pass Quests will unlock players all of the followng: It’s not just AoT gear that the patch brought, however.
