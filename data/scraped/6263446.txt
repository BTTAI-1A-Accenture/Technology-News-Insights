IU and Park Bo Gum will be uniting in a new drama! On January 27, production company Pan Entertainment confirmed that the two actors will be starring in the upcoming drama “You Have Done Well” (literal title), with the Korean title written in the Jeju dialect. The upcoming drama will tell the life stories of Ae Soon and Gwan Shik who were born on Jeju Island in the 1950s. IU will take on the role of Ae Soon, who is rebellious but gets nervous every time she rebels. She isn’t well off but is always shining and full of positivity. She dreams of becoming a poet although she is unable to attend school, and she is a bold character who doesn’t hide any emotions. Park Bo Gum has been cast for the role of Gwan Shik, an extremely diligent and quiet character. Romance isn’t a strength for him, however, and he doesn’t know how to act if Ae Soon cries or laughs, but he is a silent warrior who only loves Ae Soon from the very beginning and pours his all into loving her. “You Have Done Well” will be written by hit writer Im Sang Choon of “Fight My Way” and “When the Camellia Blooms” and directed by Kim Won Seok, who previously worked on “Misaeng (Incomplete Life),” “Signal,” and “My Mister.” The drama is scheduled to begin production in the first half of this year.
