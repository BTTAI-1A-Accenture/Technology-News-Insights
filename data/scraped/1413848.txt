Honor Android MWC 2023
 The GSM Association's website has confirmed Honor's presence at the Mobile World Congress 2023 in Barcelona. The company will have its own booth this time, unlike last year when it only held an event but wasn't present on the ground. This clearly points to a major announcement at the event. The MWC 2023 will kick off on February 27 in Barcelona, which coincides with the rumored launch date of the Magic5 series. Honor is yet to officially confirm its plans, but this new discovery definitely increases the odds of them proving true. We could see the Magic5, Magic 5 Pro, and Magic5 Ultimate with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, and triple 50MP camera system (quad on the Pro and Ultimate, per Digital Chat Station). We'll keep our eyes peeled and update you once Honor reveals more about its MWC attendance. Honor was a part of Huawei and spun off due to sanctions. Sanctions should apply to both Honor and Huawei but US sanctions department is busy with Russia.  Honor is not under sanctions, Huawei is X90 pro has boe Q9 while Pro+ has samsung E6.
