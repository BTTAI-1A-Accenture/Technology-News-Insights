Metro Councilwoman Jennifer Chappell partnered with Louisville Metro Animal Services (LMAS) to remind people about getting their pets vaccinated. A pet vaccine clinic was held at Wyandotte Park on Sunday. The clinic offered several services, including discounted rabies vaccines, pet licenses, microchipping and free DAPP vaccinations for the first 200 pets. LMAS was also accepting donations of leashes, collars, dog and cat food, cleaning supplies, blankets and towels at the clinic.  The organization is always looking for donations. Anyone can drop off supplies at LMAS on Newburg Road during business hours. LMAS is also currently waiving pet adoption fees as part of the BISSELL Pet Foundation's "Empty the Shelters" event until Sunday, Oct. 15.
