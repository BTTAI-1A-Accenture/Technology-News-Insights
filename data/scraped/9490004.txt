The 2024 presidential race is taking shape. President Joe Biden announced April 25 that he is running for reelection. Former President Donald Trump, defeated by Biden in 2020, announced Nov. 15, 2022, that he is seeking a second, non-consecutive term in the White House. Other Republican Oval Office aspirants have followed him into the race. Here is what you need to know about the presidential election 2024. The next presidential election date is Nov. 5, 2024. Biden is the White House incumbent, but a couple of Democrats already have announced intentions to challenge him. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 69, is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of former U.S. Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who was assassinated in 1968 while running for president. Kennedy is an environmental attorney who more recently has gained notoriety as an anti-vaccine political gadfly. Author Marianne Williamson, 70, who unsuccessfully sought the 2020 Democratic nomination, also has announced she's running again. Trump, 76, was the first to announce a 2024 candidacy and remains the clear GOP front-runner. Since he got into the race, he has been joined by Nikki Haley, 51, a former South Carolina governor and the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; Asa Hutchinson, 72, a former Arkansas governor; Larry Elder, 71, a libertarian-leaning radio talk show host; and Vivek Ramaswamy, 37, an independently wealthy entrepreneur. Other Republican possibilities for 2024 include former Vice President Mike Pence, 63; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 44; former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 60; and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, 48. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, 56, also has been the focus of speculation, which he didn't dispel when he recently said he wouldn't be seeking the White House "this year" (2023). If reelected, Biden would be 86 on the day he leaves the White House. Trump would be 82. Yes, although technically it is called a presidential preference election. According to state law, the presidential preference election is held the Tuesday immediately following March 15 of a presidential election year. That would make it March 19, 2024. However, the law also gives the governor the authority to push back the date via a proclamation issued no later than 180 days before the new date. Arizona law says no. The Democratic National Convention, where the Democratic presidential and vice presidential candidates will accept the party's nomination, is set for Aug. 19, 2024, to Aug. 22, 2024, in Chicago. The Republican National Convention, where the GOP presidential and vice presidential candidates will accept the party's nominations, is scheduled for July 15, 2024, to July 18, 2024, in Milwaukee. Arizona has 11 votes in the Electoral College. The number is a combination of the number of U.S. senators and the number of U.S. representatives the state has. Arizona, like every state, has two senators. Arizona has nine U.S. House seats. It's still early in the 2024 campaign cycle, but Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes has published a draft election calendar on his office's website. That's a complicated question. Arizona for decades was a reliably red state in presidential elections, but Biden in 2020 became the first Democrat to carry Arizona since President Bill Clinton in 1996 and the second since President Harry Truman did so in 1948. Arizona also has a Democratic governor and one Democratic U.S. senator (and a second senator who was elected as a Democrat but changed to independent while in office). Changing demographics and the Republican Party's push to the right during the Trump era have contributed to the shift. Yes. While people may argue about whether Arizona is a "red," "blue" or "purple" state, everyone expects the major-party presidential nominees and their allies to shower attention and money on the competitive state. That's what happened in 2020, and it's a safe bet that it will happen again in 2024. In doubt:ASU wants to host a 2024 presidential debate, but here's why there might not be any As of April 2023, Arizona's voter registration numbers broke down this way: Republicans, 34.6%; independents, 34.3%; and Democrats, 30.3%. Libertarians made up 0.8% of the state's nearly 4.2 million registered voters. Dan Nowicki is The Arizona Republic's national politics editor. Follow him on Twitter at @dannowicki.
