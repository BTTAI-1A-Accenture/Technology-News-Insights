 Hey LinkedIn Family! This is Joseph from and I wanted to invite all of you on as a guest on my new Instagram Live show.  The purpose of my new show is just to catch up with professionals around the world and to be a sounding board for any thoughts, visions and conflicts you may be having as you push through the global pandemic.  I would love to have you as a guest!  If you are interested please sign up using the link below.  You will need to follow me on Instagram so we can go live together! It cost nothing, just a little time! The show will also air on all popular podcast platforms and may even appear on TV! Have a great week and just know that I'm here if you need me.  Schedule your appearance here! https://calendly.com/josephbonnerteam/15min Connect with me on Instagram! https://instagram.com/mrjosephbonner All love,  Joseph Bonner       If there is a way I can help you find issues and perhaps authors/film makers relating to human rights, this is something I would be interested in. Inspired to help others find their place after a lifetime of moving! How do you get your FB back when you’re hacked and you have no way of reporting the hack? 🤦🏽♀️ Salesman/Speaker/Sales Trainer @ "The Closers"/Coach/Consultant Congratulations!

Reach out to me again after you’ve been through your “shakedown” and have at least a moderate audience.

Best wishes! Next Trend Realty LLC./  Har.com/Chester-Swanson/agent_cbswan Well Said.
