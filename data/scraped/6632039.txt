Factory closings, labor issues and shipping bottlenecks, all  sparked by the COVID pandemic, continue unabated, and semiconductors continue  to top the list of critical components in short supply for many manufacturers.  If there was a recurring narrative in 2022 it was the  ongoing attempt to account for this shortage and reshore supply back to the  United States. Passage of the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce  Semiconductors) and Science Act, signed into law by President Biden on August 9,  was supposed to accomplish that.  So, much as we recognized COVID-19’s role in the forced  adoption of automation in 2021, IndustryWeek’s 2022 Manufacturing Technology  Leader of the Year goes to the industry’s biggest headache—the semiconductor  industry that so dominated manufacturing technology headlines this year.  The semiconductor supply chain tendrils out to hundreds of  industries for whom chips are critical manufacturing components—automotive,  consumer electronics, IIoT sensors, PCs and servers just to name a few.  Factories go idle when chips aren’t available. The United States military  increasingly depends on semiconductors for its most advanced weapons systems,  so chip shortages also become national security issues, especially when the  chips are sourced from abroad. To make matters worse, solving the semiconductor shortage is  a solution measured in decades. It may take 10 years before the United States  is only positioned to take a global leadership position in semiconductor  manufacturing, once the infrastructure exists. That makes aggressive, immediate  steps to reshore chip manufacturing even more important. That said, the industry’s massive spending and decisive  moves only provide a partial solution to solve today’s supply chain  challenges. The investments tackle one-half of the semiconductor market—expensive,  complicated, high-end chips for computing and storage. Simpler processors  needed by automakers and other industries to handle audio systems or manage  flows in pumps—those will remain scarce, despite the high-profile  groundbreakings.  There are many  industries, like automotive, that may have little to celebrate from this year’s  new plant announcements. It’s a start, and at least Washington and industry leaders  are on the same page, but these high-profile steps aren’t likely to provide  enough supply chain relief and stem the continuing economic damage. Almost two-thirds of the world’s semiconductor supply come  from Taiwan, an island nation slightly larger than Maryland that sits less than  100 miles east of mainland China. A single company, Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), alone manufacturers 55% of the world’s chips. Around  90% of the world’s most advanced chips specifically hail from Taiwan. Maritime  shipping problems during the pandemic hit the semiconductor industry  particularly hard. Goldman Sachs in April 2021 listed 169 industries affected  by the shortages. The highest-profile examples hail from automotive, with Ford,  GM, Honda, Toyota and Volkswagen, among others, all reducing or halting production  for lack of chips. The semiconductor industry responded with a series of  massive investments in new chip manufacturing plants. Texas  Instruments and Samsung  announced plans in 2021 to build new fabs in the U.S., to the tunes of $30 billion and $17 billion respectively. This year, Intel  announced a $20 billion investment for a new fab site in Ohio and Micron  announced a $100 billion investment for a new fab in New York State.

This year’s announcements generated additional fanfare, owing  to their connection to the CHIPS and Science Act. The legislation created a $52.7B  fund for grants, loans and other incentives, new tax credits for fabs  investment in the U.S. and $170B for R&D programs. Between five new fabs and federal funding, will we see the  beginning of the end of the semiconductor shortage? It depends on which  industries you’re talking about. The chip market roughly breaks down into two categories of  chips. “High-end” or advanced chips largely for computation (read: PCs) and  data storage (read: servers), and “low-end” chips for less-demanding  applications like automotive hardware, consumer electronics and IIoT sensors;  i.e., “mature technologies.”  Micron primarily manufacturers memory, a chip component but  not a chip itself, so its new fab could hypothetically serve both sides of the  semiconductor market. Other recently announced fabs, however, are squarely  aimed at the high-end market, not the mature technologies. “These fabs won’t  really address demand for lower-end microcontrollers, logic chips and other  smaller, less expensive semiconductors,” says Glenn O’Donnell, VP, research  director at Forrester. “This ‘low end’ of the market remains in seriously short  supply.” ABI Research Vice  President Malik Saadi says backlogs for some parts are stretching into 2024. “The immediate need is really to create more fab capacity to  address the long-tail chipset shortage (sensors, MCUs, RF, etc.) and cater for  the needs of a multitude of end-products that rely heavily on this type of  chip,” Saadi continues.  A core problem, says Bharat Kapoor, partner and global lead  of Kearney’s industrial redesign practice, PERLab, is that chip makers focus on  where they have competitive advantages and high profit margins. It’s a classic  manufacturing issue, companies want to add value to products by being critical  suppliers of unique components, not commodity players selling large volumes of  things that almost anyone can make. “An iPhone 14 will only run on the latest 5nm chip which  only TSMC can make, no one else can. So, TSMC is incentivized to make more  capacity [for high-end chips] and can demand high prices.” Kapoor says. “If you look at the CHIPS  Act of America Fund, the report states clearly that the department of  commerce (DOC) funding incentives for chipset manufacturing is at $39 billion,  of which only $2 billion (or 5% of total incentives) dedicated to mature  semiconductor technologies,” says Saadi. “The CHIPS Act is mainly designed to  promote the competitiveness of the USA in the cutting-edge semiconductor  business, not for addressing the current supply shortage addressing mature  semiconductor technologies mainly.”  Even if the CHIPS Act doesn’t offer any short-term relief,  it deals with a long-term problem that needs to be addressed. The  legislation also bolsters R&D in the United States. Our defense technology  will only get more sophisticated and innovating here also serves national  security interests. But how much help does the CHIPS Act actually represent? “Building new fabs is insanely  expensive — upward of $20 billion for an advanced fab and $2 billion minimum  for a less advanced fab. The big three fab operators collectively committed to  hundreds of billions of U.S. expansion. CHIPS Act funding won’t make much of a  dent here,” wrote O’Donnell in August. “As this money gets divided across its  many recipients and spread across five years, disbursements will be in much  smaller slices.” During a presentation at IndustryWeek’s 2022  Manufacturing and Technology Show in October, Intel Principal Engineer Paul  Schneider explained why chip making is so costly. The process of layering  microscopic circuits on top of each other is more like making a pizza than  carving a tablet, he explained. Silicon wafers move from station to station in  fabs, gaining a layer of pathways each time, with dozens of layers added to  each chip. Each station is a machine costing at least $100 million and about  the size of a school bus. For the companies that will benefit from the  construction of these new fabs, relief is still years away. Not only are  fabs expensive to build, they take a long time to get into production. “Expect it will take new semiconductor fabrication plants at  least 4 years from date of groundbreaking to be in full production, and that’s  assuming everything goes according to plan,” says Kapoor. “In general, it takes  two-plus years to build a fab, assuming fab equipment is available on a timely  basis, and another one-year-plus to get it producing at scale.” “This process could take even longer [than 4 to 5 years] in  the case of building wafers used for high-performance computing applications,”  says Saadi.  “We won’t see the  fruits of these new ‘fabs’ until 2024 through 2026,” says O’Donnell. “It takes  a LONG time to build one of these facilities.”  For the immediate future, then, we can expect the supply of  chips for mature technologies to continue hailing from Taiwan. Prioritizing  reshoring high-end chips makes sense if national security concerns are driving  this effort, as China continues to view Taiwan with an eye toward annexation. This  bipartisan concern arguably ended the logjam that stalled the CHIPS Act in Congress.   Will we ever see a day when all semiconductor  production, not just high-end chips, shifts out of Taiwan to the Americas and  Europe? “TSMC is going to remain at the leading-edge of  semiconductor manufacturing for the foreseeable future,” says Kapoor. “Their  existing dominance in producing the most advanced chips, partnered with a new  geographic diversification strategy, and supported by recent U.S. chip export  guidelines, will keep them at the front of the race while Samsung, Intel and  others continue to chase them.” There may be more hope for the future, however. “In 15 years, the next gen fabs will be highly automated and  could be operated from anywhere in the world where skills are available,” says  Saadi. “Automation will enable Europe and North America to lower the cost of  operating these fabs and become extremely competitive against low labor cost  regions like Taiwan and China. All indications point to the fact that Europe  and the USA are positioned to lead the 2030s era.” As O’Donnell sees it, “We won’t stop sourcing chips from  Asia, but we will get more from other places as those sites go live.  Globalization remains a good thing. Too much of a good thing is a bad thing,  which is precisely what happened with semiconductor supply.”                                                                                                                                                              The  steps taken by the semiconductor industry in 2002 won’t address the shortages  for some time and even then not for all the industries suffering from chip  shortages. But the collective, decisive action by multiple companies to get the  process started with high-end chips and R&D demonstrates enough foresight  and resolve to celebrate the semiconductor industry as the IndustryWeek  Manufacturing Technology Leader of the Year.
