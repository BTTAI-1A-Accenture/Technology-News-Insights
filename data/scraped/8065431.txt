Performance Food Group Co. engages in the market and distribution of food products. It operates through the following segments: Foodservice, Vistar, & Convenience. The Foodservices segment delivers food and food-related products to independent restaurants, chain restaurants, and other institutional food-away-from-home locations. The Vistar segment offers candy, snack, and beverage to customers in the vending, office coffee services, theater, retail, and other channels. The Convenience segment consists of a range of products, marketing programs and technology solutions to locations in the United States and Canada. The company was founded in 1885 and is headquartered in Richmond, VA. The already-powerful company aims to bulk up even more through acquisitions. Shares of the food distributor got a boost from the company's earnings update, which was clearly pretty good. The company is likely on a multi-year upswing that can carry its stock even higher. The food supplier shared encouraging weekly sales data ahead of an investing conference. Investors applauded some good news in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers could trickle back to their favorite restaurants again. Food service distribution may be in for a wake-up call if Amazon continues to expand in the space. Stronger cash flow wasn't enough to overcome a Q4 underperformance and a weak fiscal 2019 outlook.
