 In the past year, the world, and the world of marketing have undergone significant changes. Weâ€™ve seen an accelerated shift in remote work and digital transformation, leading to an increased demand for cloud-based software solutions. As a result, SaaS companies, in particular, are facing heightened competition, making it more important than ever for marketers to stay ahead of the curve. Here are the biggest shifts Iâ€™ve seen in marketing over the last year and the top performing strategies for marketers to keep in mind in 2023.Â Â  The rise of account-based marketing (ABM)Â  Â ABM is a targeted approach to marketing that focuses on specific accounts and the individuals within them. This strategy has become increasingly important in the SaaS industry, as it allows companies to personalize their marketing efforts and build stronger relationships with their target accounts.Â  To better understand the shift in ABM letâ€™s look at some examples of SaaS companies that have seen success implementing this marketing strategy -Â Â Â  	*Source: 7 Successful Account Based Marketing Examples from Top B2B SaaS CompaniesÂ  Increased emphasis on customer engagementÂ  Companies are placing a greater emphasis on customer engagement and customer success. This includes the use of customer feedback, customer support, and customer success management to build lasting relationships with customers and keep them engaged with the company and its products. Look no further than right here on social media. Companies increased their social media presence and their community support to ensure customerâ€™s questions, concerns and technical issues are dealt with in a timely manner. If youâ€™re looking for inspiration on what great customer engagement looks like, look no further than long-time marketing leader, Nike. Nike has one of the most robust and supportive social media support teams in the world.Â Â  *Source: Social Customer Service: Lessons from 5 of our favorite brandsÂ  The importance of personalizationÂ  Personalization has become a key factor in marketing, as consumers demand more personalized experiences and tailored solutions. Marketers can use customer data to deliver personalized content and messaging, as well as to recommend products and services that meet the specific needs of each customer.Â  While personalization may be hard to conceptualize for all brands, especially when we are surrounded by highly personal marketing techniques from companies like Amazon, Spotify and Netflix,Â it is important to remember that personalization doesnâ€™t have to be complicated. Simply let your customers know that you are listening to their needs (but not in a creepy way ðŸ˜‰).Â  Focus on data-driven marketingÂ  Data-driven marketing has become essential, as it allows marketers to make informed decisions based on customer data and insights. Marketers can use data to optimize their campaigns, target the right customers, and measure the success of their marketing efforts.Â  I am encouraged by how our marketing team here at PowerSchool is already practicing with data-driven marketing. Our team of agile experts leverage data through a multi-pronged approach withÂ 6Sense, chat, and search to bringÂ our insights together andÂ engage our audiences in the best way and style forÂ them.Â  In 2023, the top-performing strategies for marketers will be those that focus on customer engagement, personalization, and data-driven marketing. Marketers who can effectively use these strategies to build strong relationships with their target accounts and customers will be well-positioned for success. Additionally, companies that invest in technology solutions to support their marketing efforts, such as marketing automation and customer data platforms, will be better poised to stay ahead of the competition in 2023 and beyond.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Senior Online Community Professional // Helping businesses retain customers through Community driven strategies Good stuff Fred, thanks for sharing - also, from a personal perspective great to note you pointing out in your second point how companies are placing more importance on the Community support channel, engaging with customers in branded online communities, and connecting them to other customers, internal experts, and information to help them realize more value is super important!
