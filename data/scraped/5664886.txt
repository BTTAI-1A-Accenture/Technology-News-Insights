Fortnite Chapter 4 – Season 2 is just around the corner. If everything goes according to plan, Epic Games will release the new season of the popular video game shortly after March 8. The video game creator announced that the current season will end on March 8. Due to this, we expect the next one to be released either on the same day or on the day after. Considering that there will be no live event, there is a chance that Fortnite Chapter 4 – Season 2 will arrive on the same day. With less than two weeks until the new seasons, reputable Fortnite leakers revealed a new Battle Pass skin. It turns out that Epic Games will finally bring the “Attack on Titan” collaboration. HYPEX, the most reputable Fortnite leaker, confirmed that the next Battle Pass will feature the “Attack on Titan” collaboration. This collaboration was leaked a while ago, but no one knew when exactly Epic Games would release it. It turns out that Eren Yeager will be added to the game with the next Battle Pass. HYPEX and ShiinaBR have confirmed that the popular character will be a secret Battle Pass skin.
