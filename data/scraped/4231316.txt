   Date (MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq)  Dublin, June 09, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "global closed system transfer devices market report and forecast 2023-2031" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's  offering.The global closed system transfer devices market size attained a value of USD 879.3 million in 2022. The market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 19.2% during the forecast period of 2023-2031 to attain a value of USD 4,306 million by 2031.   Closed System Transfer Devices Market: Introduction  Closed system transfer devices (CSTDs) are medical devices used to transfer hazardous drugs from one container to another while minimizing the risk of exposure to healthcare workers and patients. They are designed to prevent the release of hazardous drugs into the environment, thus reducing the risk of contamination and exposure.CSTDs are used in a variety of healthcare settings, including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies, for the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. These drugs include chemotherapy agents, hormones, and immunosuppressants, among others. The use of CSTDs is particularly important for healthcare workers who handle hazardous drugs on a regular basis, as they are at a higher risk of exposure to these drugs and their harmful effects.  Benefits of CSTDs include:     Increased safety: CSTDs reduce the risk of exposure to hazardous drugs by preventing leaks and spills, minimizing the release of drug particles into the air, and providing a closed system for drug transfer   Compliance with regulations: The use of CSTDs is mandated by regulatory bodies such as the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)   Cost-effective: The use of CSTDs can help reduce healthcare costs by preventing exposure-related illnesses and injuries and minimizing the need for additional medical treatment   Improved drug efficacy: CSTDs can help improve the efficacy of hazardous drugs by reducing the loss of drug particles during preparation and administration   Overall, the use of CSTDs is an important measure for ensuring the safety of healthcare workers and patients who handle or are exposed to hazardous drugs. CSTDs provide a closed system for drug transfer, which reduces the risk of contamination and exposure to hazardous drugs, while also complying with regulatory requirements and improving drug efficacy.  Closed System Transfer Devices Market Segmentations  The market can be categorised into type, technology, component, end user, and major region.
