Technology In Restaurants Shifts in labor trends, as well as the adjustments made during the pandemic, have made it clear that the restaurant industry needs to evolve. Both restaurant owners and consumers have significantly changed how they interface when it comes to food and hospitality, and this is becoming clearer by the day. To dig deeper into this topic, I turned to Sam Zietz, CEO at GRUBBRR, a cutting-edge provider of self-ordering technology that is paving the way for innovation in the hospitality sector. Gary Drenik: What are some of the ways restaurants have used technology to alleviate the burden of the labor shortage?  Sam Zietz: In today's evolving restaurant landscape, labor shortages have pressed many operators to seek innovative solutions, and self-ordering technology, particularly kiosks, have emerged as a leading solution. Kiosks have redefined the order-taking process, allowing customers to browse high-resolution menus, customize orders, and make payments all without a cashier. This autonomy reduces the immediate need for front-of-house staff and refines the customer experience by ensuring orders are taken accurately, minimizing errors and waste. Moreover, with the intelligence of digital interfaces, kiosks nudge customers towards promotional items or upsells, driving up sales like a waiter might. The versatility of kiosks doesn't end at ordering; they can dynamically update based on available ingredients, ensuring guests aren't disappointed after placing an order. This capability minimizes the need for operators to constantly communicate out-of-stock items, which, in a labor-scarce environment, is invaluable. Further, payments are streamlined – from tapping a credit card to scanning a QR code, the multifunctional kiosk handles it, reducing the need for cashiers and the risks associated with cash handling. On the backend, integrating these kiosks with kitchen display systems ensures that the culinary team receives clear instructions, optimizing workflow. While self-ordering kiosks cannot replace human interaction, they show how technology can be leveraged to navigate and adapt to challenges like labor shortages. Drenik: What technology and digital solutions are having the most profound impact on restaurant retailers? Why? Zietz: The landscape of restaurant operations is experiencing a tectonic shift, with technology playing a central role in creating modern dining experiences. Self-ordering kiosks stand out as game-changers for operators. Replacing cashiers, they are becoming ubiquitous fixtures in eateries. This autonomy serves a dual purpose: enhancing customer experience and addressing operational challenges. According to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics survey, kiosk ordering options are really landing with the Gen-Z and Millennial customer bases. Over 47% of the Gen-Z cohort and nearly 46% of the Millennial cohort said they utilize kiosks occasionally when ordering at a fast-food restaurant. We anticipate that these rates will remain the same, if not increase, as more restaurants adopt this approach.

However, what gives kiosks an edge over traditional methods is real-time adaptability. They can alter menu displays based on availability, ensuring that customers are always presented with current options. The integration of these kiosks with back-end systems creates seamless communication with kitchen staff, ensuring that orders are prepared accurately and promptly. In fact, according to a recent Prosper Insights & Analytics Survey, fast service is the second most important reason why people go out to eat to begin with.

Drenik: How will restaurant jobs look different for employees returning to work amid the technology boom? Zietz: The technological boom, led by automation, is reshaping roles and responsibilities of employees. Kiosks automate what was once a manual process. As a result, the role of the cashier is transforming. Employees who once stood behind counters can now be reallocated to other areas of the restaurant. There is a renewed focus on roles that demand interpersonal skills, such as customer service. For successful implementation of this technology, employees may be trained as “kiosk ambassadors” guiding first-time users or addressing on-spot technical hitches. In the kitchen, the integration of kiosks with digital kitchen display systems allows cooks to adapt to a more dynamic flow of orders, optimizing preparation and ensuring accuracy. As these kiosks begin to collect data, new roles centered around analytics will be in demand. This will also help restaurants tailor their offerings based on customer preferences. While the technological boom might appear to forego the need for people, it paradoxically shifts the focus more toward human-centric roles, emphasizing assistance and hospitality. As employees return to this new-age landscape, adaptability, a willingness to learn, and an understanding of needs will be at the forefront. Drenik: How has technology impacted the restaurant industry and consumer trends? What are your predictions for the future? Zietz: Diners are more accustomed to digital ordering and have embraced it, enjoying the ability to browse and customize an order at their own pace. This has led to faster service, reduced human error, and increased ticket sizes thanks to upselling algorithms. As a reflection of the broader digitalization trend, kiosks have also influenced a surge in cashless transactions, meeting a growing consumer preference for contactless methods. These innovations have spawned new data-driven strategies. Restaurants equipped with insights from kiosks and loyalty programs will be able to make more informed decisions on menu changes, staffing, or promotions. Looking to the future, I predict an even deeper integration of technology with dining experiences. As AI and machine learning continue to advance, kiosks will become more intuitive, potentially offering personalized menu suggestions. Augmented reality might weave its way in, allowing diners to visualize dishes in 3D before ordering. As the lines between technology and hospitality blur, restaurants will focus on striking a balance, ensuring that human interaction remains at the heart of dining. Drenik: How has the consumer experience changed in restaurants and what’s next? Zietz: Once a space dominated by human interaction, modern dining has become transformed by technology. Kiosks offer diners unmatched customization. Customers, particularly the tech-savvy generation, appreciate the ability to customize and place orders at their own pace. The result is a curated journey and an experience that enhances efficiency, reduces wait times, and offers a sense of control. Menus are no longer static; they're dynamic. Customization tailored directly to each customer will be the next big advancement in providing customers with a possible experience. Payment processes have also been revolutionized, with diners able to quickly checkout using multiple payment methods, ranging from traditional credit cards to digital wallets. As for what’s next, self-ordering technology will continue to evolve, harnessing AI to provide personalized recommendations, recall past orders, or suggest dishes. With an increasing emphasis on sustainability and transparency, kiosks may one day detail the sourcing or environmental impact of a meal, enabling consumers to make more ethical choices. Operators will need to evolve and continue to meet customers where they want while providing positive experiences that will keep guests coming back.
