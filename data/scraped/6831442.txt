FootJoy turns 100 this year, and the party is just getting started. Celebrating a century of golf-specific design, FootJoy has become a footwear and apparel brand trusted by players of all levels because of a singular dedication to the game of golf. Its relentless commitment to performance innovation, style, comfort and quality has made FootJoy a household name in the golf industry. A little history: In 1923, the Field & Flint Company first introduced a line of shoes. The name and the brand were born from a company-wide naming competition where a female associate in the Brockton, Mass., stitching room submitted a name for the new shoes: FootJoy. What started then has become a legacy of leadership and footwear dominance that has continued for 100 years.

Whether you’ve played all your life or are just starting out, FootJoy is devoted to making golf shoes for every level of golfer.  So what’s in store for the big milestone year? One project in the works is the FitLab, which made its prototype debut at the PGA Show in January. FootJoy’s own research indicates that 70 percent of golfers wear the wrong size shoe, and it firmly believes a proper fitting shoe is critical to your golf game. The FitLab measures every single part of your foot, asks you a few questions and then recommends the best size and style shoe based on exact dimensions. It’s a technology that’s been used in fitting ski boots and running shoes, which are also sports that consider footwear as equipment for your feet.  There will be collaborations and limited-edition drops throughout the year—one in particular will be around the U.S. Open that goes along with the 100-year moment—but the first exciting footwear launch happens in March.  The new HyperFlex and HyperFlex Carbon golf shoes are finely tuned to deliver hyper power, hyper control and hyper fit for men and women. Several tour players have already made the switch to incorporate HyperFlex golf shoes in practice and in play at tournaments around the world, and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive. FootJoy research shows that 70 percent of golfers wear incorrectly sized shoes, so enter its FitLab (demonstrated at the 2023 PGA Merchandise Show). Janice Ferguson/SI “The new HyperFlex and HyperFlex Carbon offer Tour-proven enhancements within the athletic silo, delivering unquestioned innovation, comfort, stability and vital design aesthetic that celebrates performance technology for the golfer athlete,” said Patrick Trubiano, director of product management for FJ Footwear. “This product will excite current HyperFlex wearers and those looking to add more power to their game.” Key features include vacuum-formed engineered mesh with molded ribbed-knit saddle for structure and support. OptiFlex zones deliver enhanced range of motion and flex to ensure maximum ground contact. Low profile spikes offer stability and support, and increased comfort is achieved with footbeds made for step-in comfort and molds to the foot for a truly custom fit over time, in addition to 100% waterproof mesh uppers. The HyperFlex series will come in both laced and boa styles, available March 1.  Scheduled for a March 17 release, are two new additions to the Premiere series collection—the Wilcox for men and Issette for women. Both offer amazing traction, great stability, lightweight construction and a refined, modern twist on a classic silhouette. Expert detailing and fine craftsmanship using full-grain leather deliver an iconic look for players with a discerning sense of style.  Worn by golf professionals such as Justin Thomas, Max Homa, Will Zalatoris, Cam Young, Jessica Korda and many more, FootJoy’s Premiere Series family of shoes is far and away the choice of more Tour players than any other model.  “The Premiere Series continues to raise the standard for performance and innovation rooted in authentic, classic styling,” Trubiano said. “Players at all levels have adopted the Field and Packard styles at unprecedented rates, and the new Wilcox and Issette patterns are sure to energize the classic category even more.”  Key features, in addition to premium, hand-selected, soft full-grain leather and luxurious calfskin details, include VersaTrax traction and stability, multiple durometers of TPU and Pulsar cleats for grip on any surface, a firmer heel-density cup for added support, custom cushioning system designed to limit walking fatigue for all-day comfort, and 2-year waterproof warranty.
