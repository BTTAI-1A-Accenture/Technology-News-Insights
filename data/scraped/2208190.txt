The University of Arkansas is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the United Statesâ
                           future semiconductor economy. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are essential materials
                           in most electronic devices and advance performance in fields such as healthcare, the
                           military, computing and transportation. Weâre building partnerships across the Heartland, we have more than 30 years of success
                           in advanced electronic packaging and we are home to the only open-access silicon carbide
                           semiconductor facility for research-to-prototyping in the country. The benefits to the state, region and country are transformative: University of Arkansas Takes Next Step to Become Leader in Semiconductors. U of A engineering researchers conducted a successful test flight of their electric
                           motor drive on a hybrid electric aircraft. NCREPT researchers designed and developed
                           battery-powered motor drives that can be used in lieu of one of the gas-powered engines.
                           These motor drive are also used in large Caterpillar bulldozers and mining equipment,
                           which can be used at high altitudes and reduce underground fumes. 2020: Researchers received a $3.6 million award from the U.S. Department of Energy
                           Solar Energy Technologies Office to advance technologies that integrate solar power
                           systems to the national power grid. The research will focus on developing cybersecurity
                           systems for photovoltaic energy technology and devices, especially solar PV inverters,
                           the power electronic devices that link solar power arrays to the grid. 2019: Researchers developing the next generation of electronics and power modules
                           for electric and hybrid vehicles with help of a $1.5 million grant from the U.S. Department
                           of Energy. The gallium oxide devices being researched by Song will foster next-generation, high-density
                                 and high-operation-temperature power converters. Dr. Wei Du, a professor in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department,
                                 has been granted $300,000 by the National Science Foundation (NSF EPSCoR). The grant
                                 will help Dr. Du's research in the development of semiconductor lasers and passive
                                 devices on a singular sapphire platform for integrated microwave photonics (IMWP). With $18 million from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and additional support
                                 from the Army Research Laboratory, the University of Arkansas has broken ground on
                                 a national silicon carbide (SiC) research and fabrication center. The Multi-User Silicon Carbide Research and Fabrication Facility at the U of A will fill a void in U.S. production of integrated circuits made with
                              silicon carbide, a powerful semiconductor well-suited for higher temperature environments. It
                              will provide domestic opportunities for prototyping, proof-of-principle demonstrations
                              and device design. MUSiC will be the only openly accessible fabrication facility of
                              its kind in the U.S., meaning its facilities and services will be available to external
                              researchers. Hugh Churchill, associate professor of physics in the J. William Fulbright College
                           of Arts and Sciences, discusses the MonArk NSF Quantum Foundry and portable air filters
                           that remove infectious airborne particles, including respiratory droplets that carry
                           coronavirus, from indoor spaces. Distinguished Professor Alan Mantooth defines semiconductors and discusses why the
                           University of Arkansas is uniquely positioned to be a semiconductor research and fabrication
                           hub in the heartland of the United States. The University of Arkansas collaborates on semiconductor R&D with leading institutions
                           such as Stanford University, University of California-Berkley, Montana State University,
                           George Washington University and Arizona State University. We are also partnering
                           with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Sandia
                           National Laboratory. We have access to some of the largest companies in the world,
                           and we are building new partnerships every day. Interested in working with us? UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS NEWS UPCOMING EVENTS
