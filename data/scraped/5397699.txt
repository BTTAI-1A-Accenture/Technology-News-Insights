Midjourney 5 ‚Äì In the classroom Midjourney 5 is the latest in AI image generation, and if you haven‚Äôt played around with it or seen it, it is truly incredible. In today‚Äôs blog, I want to explore ways in which we could potentially use this extraordinary tool in the classroom. Like some other forms of artificial intelligence, it has the potential to be an absolute game-changer. No longer do you need to be a talented artist to create truly breathtaking images. If you can imagine it and write it, you can bring it to life.In my opinion the only downside to Midjourney 5 is that it only operates inside of Discord. Discord is currently blocked in some schools.¬† However, I understand that will be changing when they bring out Midjourney 6 later in 2023 where it will have it‚Äôs own standalone app.How would this look in the clasroomHowever, before we get into this, I want you to keep in mind that this is just a tool and you need to have an authentic purpose. Otherwise, it is very easy to fall down the rabbit hole of creating images for the sake of creating images. I may be speaking from experience here.Who‚Äôs line is it anyway One of a teacher‚Äôs favourite writing tools is Pobble 365 with their beautiful and creative images to inspire your writers.. With Mid journey you can take prompts from children to create your very own surreal images for them to write about. What better way to give students agency of their own writing, than by collectively creating that inspirational image?¬† Here‚Äôs an example I tried with a class.¬† Name an animal = Walrus.¬†Name a location = The beachName an activity = Sitting in a chair eating a burger. Once the image has been rendered (about 60 seconds), it‚Äôs time for the students to write their narrative. Interesting Banners for Classroom and Google SitesSometimes finding free images for banners can be time consuming and a little bit daunting,¬† even though¬† there are options built into some of the¬† the programs, however, we might want something a little bit more unique and in this case Midjourney 5 is your solution. In this next example, I was looking for a banner for my Matariki Google Classroom. ‚Äúbackground that has a star or Matariki image with Maori influence ‚Äìar 1600:400‚Äù That last part (‚Äìar 1600:400) is the aspect ratio that I‚Äôve changed to get the right size. Mid Journey will generate 4 options and can choose the one we like the best.  Stock imagesDo you get frustrated when you find the perfect image online, but when you go to download it, you realise it has shutter stock or copyright plastered over the image. Grrrr!¬†Last week I needed an image of a robot for a presentation I was doing on computational thinking. Online a found a few images, but the very very basic clipart and didn‚Äôt fit with the theme of my slide. This is what I got from Midjourney 5.  I will reiterate one more time: Mid Journey is a very powerful AI tool that can save you time and money.
