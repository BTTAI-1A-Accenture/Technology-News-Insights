AppleToolBox Tools and Fixes for Mac, iPad, iPhone & iWatch By Danny Maiorca 0 comments Last updated October 4, 2023 StandBy was one of a handful of new features that Apple announced would come to iOS 17. Users can now easily make their devices look more like alarm clocks, and the feature is helpful for quickly accessing widgets and whatnot. You also have the option to activate Night Mode if you wish. What exactly is Night Mode for StandBy, though? And if you want to use the feature, how do you activate it? We’ll reveal the answer to both questions in this guide. Contents Night Mode for StandBy will add a red tint to your display, and you’ll have lower lighting as well. It works quite similar to the Night Shift feature that you might have used when customizing your iPhone’s brightness and display. However, you won’t see a yellow tint like you would with that particular feature. Turning on the Night Mode feature for StandBy is simple. After downloading iOS 17 on your iPhone, you can follow these instructions. StandBy is a useful tool for accessing your widgets from your iPhone while it’s charging. You’ll also find the feature helpful for checking out the time, along with whether you have any events in your calendar. If you want to alter the lighting, Night Mode is a useful tool to switch on. Now that you’ve read this guide, you should have all the information you need in order to turn on Night Mode for StandBy on your iPhone. If you later decide that you’d like to switch the feature off, you can follow these steps in reverse.
