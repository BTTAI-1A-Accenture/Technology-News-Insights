American Airlines will now charge for checked bags on all basic economy tickets.  The airline announced it would introduce a $75 fee for the first checked bags on its cheapest fares on transoceanic flights, saying the change is meant to make the terms of basic economy more consistent across its network. “We are simplifying our product offerings to make it easier for customers when they are shopping for travel. With this change, our Basic Economy product will include all of the same features whether a customer is purchasing it for a domestic or international flight,” Andrea Koos, an American Airlines spokesperson said in a statement. But for consumers, this is obviously a frustrating move. It means that on the longest flights, a ticket will cost nearly $100 more than the published price if you wind up needing to check a bag. Designing for more legroomHow engineering lets economy airplane seats offer more knee space in the same close quarters United Airlines and Delta Air Lines continue to offer free first checked bags on transpacific flights for basic economy ticketholders, but like American, charge $75 on transatlantic flights.  The Biden Administration and the Department of Transportation have been trying to crack down on airline fees, but so far there has been no formal change to restrict bag charges.
