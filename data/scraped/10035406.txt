 Every week, the Marketing team at The Social Shepherd puts together all the relevant industry updates in a round-up newsletter sent every Monday morning. This way, we keep our team, clients and interested marketers up to date with what's going on in the social media industry :) Don't forget to subscribe if you want to be updated every week. Introducing X: Elon Musk announced and launched Twitter’s new name, ‘X’, as part of his broader vision of an ‘everything app’.  He also shared a poll asking users if he should change the platform’s iconic blue colour to black and confirming that Tweets would now be called ‘an X’.  Hashtags Coming to Threads: Some Android users have noticed the ability to include hashtags in their Threads. However, these are still not working, but it shows that the development team are working on some new functionalities and updates.   How to Integrate Brands on Threads: Meta has shared a few tips on how brands can make the most out of Threads:      Ads Starter Guide for TikTok: Through a fun quiz, TikTok has released a custom Ads Starter Guide for businesses, designed to help them get started with paid campaigns on the platform. Once the user has filled in the straightforward 5-step questionnaire, they’re provided with a checklist of the next steps to follow, as well as detailed explanations and examples for every step.  Text-Based Posts on TikTok: It might be because Twitter is taking steps in a different direction, but TikTok has just announced a new functionality to share text-based posts on the platform.  TikTok users will be able to add stickers, tags and hashtags, background colours and sounds.  Chat Invitations on Instagram: This is not a new feature but an updated one. Instagram has announced that from now on, all DM requests will now be chat invitations.   Reel’s Polls: From now on, users will be able to add polls to the Reel’s description instead of as a sticker.   Expanding the Instagram Creator Subscriptions Program: Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, announced that they’re expanding the Creator Subscription Program worldwide to help more creators monetise their presence on the platform. Creators joining this program can share exclusive posts, Stories, Reels, broadcast channels and lives with their subscribers.
