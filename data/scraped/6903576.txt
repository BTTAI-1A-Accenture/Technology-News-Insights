									 Choosing an internet service provider (ISP) means finding the right one for your needs based on availability, cost, speed and several other factors. A recent Forbes Home internet survey we conducted found that on average, people spend 6.5 hours on the internet every day, so having a reliable ISP is important. A massive number of ISPs exist, all offering various plans, terms, prices and bundling options. The sheer number of companies and plans available can make picking one challenging, luckily we’re here to help. The Forbes Home team is committed to bringing you independent, unbiased ratings and information. We use data and expert advice to inform all of our content. For this article we evaluated 22 national internet providers offering a variety of connection types including fiber, DSL, cable, fixed wireless, satellite and 5g home internet services. We then scored them against 39 different attributes including pricing, availability, customer reviews and more. Plus, our advisory board of licensed professionals fact-checks and reviews our content for accuracy and relevancy. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and the internet providers’ methodology for the ratings below. Key Takeaways 
 AT&T Internet tops our list of the best internet providers scoring 4.5 out of 5 stars against our methodology metrics. AT&T offers some of the fastest internet speeds around at an affordable price. The company also offers great options for bundling AT&T internet with television and cell services. AT&T’s unlimited data, simple DIY setup and wide array of plan options help keep it ahead of the competition. We compared the ratings, costs and speed of our top internet providers after completing our research and analysis across criteria including plan features, pricing, coverage and customer reviews and experiences. 	Best Overall Best Overall AT&T Internet    Our pick for the best overall internet provider is AT&T Internet. Recieving a score of 4.5 out of 5 stars this company offers incredible value with plans that reach speeds up to 5 Gbps. In addition AT&T offers unlimited data and let’s users use their own compatible router or rent a gateway from the company. AT&T stands out in the 21 states where it’s available for delivering some of the fastest internet speeds, thanks to its expanding fiber network. For areas not yet reached by fiber, AT&T still offers competitive speeds up to 100 Mbps in its most affordable plans, ensuring reliable internet access across a broad spectrum of locations. Why We Like It The highlight of AT&T’s internet service is its provision of plans featuring unlimited data without binding customers into annual contracts. Features like these accounted for 21% of its overall score according to our methodology. This flexibility and value are enhanced by the option to bundle internet with TV and cellular services, offering a comprehensive home connectivity solution. The ease of DIY setup is a bonus, though the option for professional installation is also available for those who prefer it. What We Don’t Like While AT&T’s internet service is generally commendable, the availability of its high-speed fiber internet is still limited to certain areas. This means not all customers can access the top speeds AT&T advertises. Additionally, the professional installation fee of $50  adds an extra cost for those opting out of the DIY setup. Who It’s Best For AT&T is ideal for customers in its service areas looking for high-speed internet with the flexibility of no annual contracts and no data caps. It’s especially suitable for those who value the convenience of bundling services and are comfortable with either setting up the service themselves or paying a small fee for professional installation. Learn more: AT&T Internet review We appreciate that AT&T offers multiple connection options and speeds using wireless, DSL and fiber where available. Connection speeds range from 10 Mbps in its wireless option to 5 Gbps for its fastest, $250 per month, fiber plan and 300 Mbps for a $55 monthly service. Depending on plan choice, customers can connect from two to more than a dozen devices. We found many customers report high satisfaction with AT&T Internet, specifically noting their reliable connections and impressive customer service on platforms like Consumer Affairs. Alternatively, some negative reviews mention price increases without notification and inexperienced professional installers. I have worked from home for the past ten years and desperately rely on good internet service. I was fortunate that I could get an AT&T hotspot. (It was the only AT&T option available at my house.) I’ve had nothing but good experiences. I have an unlimited data plan, and the speeds and connection are strong enough for me to work from my laptop and take advantage of streaming services.
— Katie Barton, AT&T Internet user Our team put AT&T to the test to get a feel of what the experience of signing up would be like for new customers. We found the website to be user friendly and easy to navigate, even for first-time users. Upon entering the site, navigate to their internet page where users will be prompted to enter their address. From there, AT&T will determine which of their internet plans is available in your area and will work best for your needs. From there, signing up is simple. When you go to check out, you’ll either be prompted to pay for professional installation or will be told if a free self-installation kit is available for your location. At this point, you can also decide if you’d like to pay an additional $10 per month to purchase extra equipment to extend your Wi-Fi. While new customers will likely find the website easy to follow, it’s not as clear for those who are trying to learn about the different plans that AT&T offers. That said, if you do get confused you can turn to the bot-powered chat and a 24/7 phone service for instant support. 	Best Pricing Best Pricing T-Mobile Home Internet    T-Mobile Home Internet is one of the most widely used internet service providers and stands out for its accessibility along with its affortability. Recieving a score of 4.3 out of 5, the company offers a range of benefits including no contracts, no data caps and no hidden fees. T-Mobile Home Internet distinguishes itself by leveraging T-Mobile’s 4G and 5G networks to offer a wireless internet connection that’s broadly accessible. This service shines in areas where traditional broadband might not reach, offering speeds ranging from 33 to 245 Mbps. It’s a game-changer for those in T-Mobile’s cellular coverage areas, providing a viable internet option with the convenience of cellular technology. Why We Like It The flat monthly rate of $50 for T-Mobile Home Internet, inclusive of gateway rental without hidden fees, makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. The potential for additional savings through service bundles, such as $10 and $20 discounts when combined with other T-Mobile plans, enhances its value proposition. The simplicity of a no-contract, price-locked service adds to the appeal, ensuring customers aren’t surprised by unexpected costs. What We Don’t Like While the widespread availability of T-Mobile Home Internet is a significant advantage, the variability of speed and connection strength based on location can be a drawback. Those in areas with weaker T-Mobile cellular signals might experience inconsistent service, which could affect internet reliability and performance. Who It’s Best For T-Mobile Home Internet is best suited for individuals and families residing in areas well-served by T-Mobile’s cellular network, looking for a straightforward, cost-effective internet solution without the complexity of traditional broadband services. It’s particularly appealing to those who appreciate the flexibility of no-contract offerings and are open to bundling services for additional savings. Learn more: T-Mobile Internet review T-Mobile offers a single home internet connection plan, the 5G Home Internet. The connection operates on the company’s 5G network, where it’s available, and on its 4G network in other locations. The plan costs $50 per month with the autopay option and includes equipment and a router. We love that discounts are available when pairing home internet with other T-Mobile products. The majority of customers had great things to say about T-Mobile Home Internet. Many reviews on Consumer Affairs highlighted their extremely helpful and knowledgeable sales reps, fast speeds and minimal internet interruptions. However, some negative reviews reflect internet throttling and issues streaming during peak times of day. As a journalist who works from home, I have had T-Mobile as my internet provider for several years. However, after having their internet, I did eventually switch back to Spectrum because the service is def better (and they gave me a better deal at the time). Since it is priced about the same as the other internet providers in my area, it makes sense to have the faster/more reliable network connection for the same price.
— Cassie Leigh, T-Mobile Internet user Based on our team’s research, it’s fairly simple to sign up for T-Mobile Internet. The obvious first step is making sure it’s 5G network is available in your area, and this can easily be done by going to the “Plan” tab on the site and clicking “Check Availability” for the plan you’re interested in. From there, you’ll be prompted to enter your address which will let you know if your area is eligible for T-Mobile internet or not. If your area can get service, you’ll get the following message: If you already have one of T-Mobile’s phone plans or have an existing account, you can follow the “Current T-Mobile Customer” button to proceed to checkout. If not, you can “Continue as guest” and it will ask you for more contact and payment information. If coverage isn’t available in your area, you’ll get the following result: You can input your information to join the waitlist in case they expand 5G to your region. Or you can see if T-Mobile Internet Lite is available. Generally, as long as it’s available in your area, signing up for T-Mobile Home Internet is easy. If you run into any issues during the sign-up process, there is an online customer support chat option or you can call customer support. If you’d rather not sign up online, you can visit a T-Mobile store to sign up in person. 	Best Plan Selection Best Plan Selection Xfinity    Xfinity recieved its positive score of 4.3 out of 5 due in part to its wide variety of plans available across 35 states nationwide. Its plans cover a wide range of speed and connectivity offerings ranging from super-fast connections with unlimited devices to more modest speeds with connectivity for up to four devices. Xfinity captures our attention with its expansive range of options tailored to diverse internet needs. The appeal of accessing Xfinity’s extensive network of hotspots nationwide adds significant value, enhancing the internet experience for its subscribers on the go. The brand’s ability to offer competitive pricing, despite variations by location and potential increases after the initial year, positions Xfinity as a strong contender in the internet service sector. Why We Like It The variety in Xfinity’s plan offerings, including eight standard options and a flexible prepaid plan, caters to a broad spectrum of users, from casual browsers to heavy streamers. Additionally, Xfinity’s Internet Essentials plan, providing affordable internet access at 50 Mbps for low-income households at just $9.95 monthly, demonstrates the company’s commitment to inclusivity and connectivity for all. What We Don’t Like While Xfinity’s diverse plan selection is commendable, the potential for price hikes after the first year and the presence of data caps can detract from the overall customer experience. These factors may necessitate closer scrutiny of plan terms and conditions by prospective customers to avoid unexpected changes in their service costs. Who It’s Best For Xfinity is ideally suited for users seeking flexibility and wide coverage, from individuals needing reliable home internet to those frequently on the move requiring hotspot access. The service is particularly beneficial for budget-conscious consumers and low-income households looking for high-speed internet without the burden of long-term financial commitments. Learn more: Xfinity Internet review Our research found that Xfinity offers one of the widest selections in the business when it comes to home internet plan choices. The company’s most widely available plans start at around $30 monthly for 75 Mbps speed and connectivity for up to four devices. Five other plans are commonly available, ranging in speeds from 200 Mbps to a 1,200 Mbps plan, costing $80 per month and featuring unlimited device connectivity. In limited locations, Xfinity also offers a 2 Gbps plan and a 6 Gbps plan, costing just under $300 per month. Most customers had positive things to say about Xfinity, many noting quick, helpful responses from online agents and fast, reliable connections. However, other customers noted technicians not showing up on time and continuing to be auto-charged even after services had been canceled. I have used Xfinity as an internet service for roughly six years. I have had a good experience and minimal problems with it. Service interruptions have been relatively brief and usually due to weather events. The Xfinity web portal contains a page that will tell you why there has been a service interruption and when it is expected to be fixed. This page generally is updated within a few minutes of the service interruption, and the expectation of when it will be fixed is usually slightly conservative (they tend to restore service slightly earlier than expected).
— Luke Smith, Xfinity user Our team went through the process of signing up for Xfinity Internet and found it to be somewhat difficult. The first time was similar to that of signing up for other companies–entering your address. From there, you’ll be able to see what plan options are available in your specific area, including any deals and bundles that are available in your location, and the price for each. Due to the sheer number of different plans and services offered by Xfinity, the website can be tough to navigate. From our experience, you’re betting off calling Xfinity to go into an in-person store to learn what options are best for you and sign up, especially if you’re looking to get the best deals and promotional offers. But if you do decide to sign up online, make note that the price you see initially might not be the same price when you go to check out, because you might need to add on the cost of equipment before you finish signing up. 	Best Value Best Value Verizon Fios    Earning a score of 4.2 out of 5, Verizon Fios is a great option for those looking to add fiber optic internet to their home at a rather affordable price. Plans start at $24.99 and go up to speeds of 1 Gbps which is fast enough for most households though slower than a lot of the competition. Verizon Fios impresses with its competitive, all-fiber network offerings, despite its limited regional availability. The integration with Verizon’s 5G mobile plans, allowing for significant discounts on high-speed internet services, showcases a unique advantage for existing mobile customers, enhancing the value of its internet packages. Why We Like It The allure of Verizon Fios lies in its budget-conscious pricing for high-speed, all-fiber internet, with plans that cater to a range of needs from a basic 300 Mbps for $24.99 per month to an ultra-fast 1 Gbps service for $64.99 per month. The additional discounts for Verizon 5G mobile users and the support for the Affordable Connectivity Program underscore the company’s commitment to affordability and accessibility in home internet services. In fact, the company’s incredible value contributed greatly to its overall score, with pricing making up 32% of the methodology. What We Don’t Like The primary drawback of Verizon Fios is its limited reach, confined to just eight states and Washington D.C., which narrows the pool of potential customers who can benefit from its services. This geographic limitation not only restricts access but also impacts the company’s overall score due to reduced availability. Availability accounts for 15% of our methodology and is the reason the company lost points. Who It’s Best For Verizon Fios is an excellent choice for customers within its service areas looking for reliable, high-speed internet at competitive prices, especially those who already use or are considering Verizon’s mobile services. The service is also well-suited for households eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program, seeking quality internet without stretching their budget. Read more: Verizon Fios Internet review Plans and pricing are straightforward with Verizon Fios. A 300 Mbps plan is available for $24.99 per month for customers with a Verizon cellular plan. Without a cell plan, the same home internet product will cost $25 more. All Fios plans come with a price-lock guarantee—two years for the 300 Mbps plan, three years for the 500 Mbps one and four years with the 1 Gig plan. With autopay and mobile plantwo-year price guarantee With autopay and mobile planthree-year price guarantee With autopay and mobile planfour-year price guarantee Many customers noted Verizon Fios’ impressive service reliability and extremely transparent pricing. However, some mentioned being disappointed with their internet speeds and their experiences with customer support. I have had Verizon Fios internet service for about five years now, and from what I have experienced, it has been very good. I use it for everything from handling my online business to everyday activities. The internet is very reliable, and I have never really had any problems over the years. Overall, I would recommend it, whether for your business or for your personal use; it works great.
— Mark Aldas, Verizon Fios user To test out how easy it is to subscribe to Verizon Fios Internet, our team went through the process of trying to sign up for their Fios 1 Gig plan as a new user. Here’s how it went. We loved that Information about their different internet plans, including speeds and pricing, was laid out clearly, making comparing options simple. Once you’ve determined the best option for you, you’ll need to enter your address to ensure that specific service is offered in your area. At this point, you may also qualify for a discount if you choose to bundle your internet plan with your Verizon mobile account. The process of receiving a quote from Verizon Fios is quick and easy since the doesn’t have any annual contracts or hidden fees. Overall, we appreciated how clear and simple the sign-up process was. We love that if you aren’t sure which plan will best suit your needs, Verizon Fios gives you the option to take a quiz that will help you choose. If you still have more questions, live representatives are available to chat. When you’re ready to check out, Verizon Fios makes it easy by listing out all that your plan offers in addition to any add-on choices you want to include. The biggest downside we experienced during the process was the requirement of a credit review. Verizon Fios, along with some other service providers, requires a credit check to confirm your identity, but ideally, we’d prefer if there was an alternative that didn’t include a credit check. 	Best Custom Plan Options Best Custom Plan Options Cox Communications    Operating in 19 states and serving millions of households, Cox Communications is the largest private telecom company in the country and has been around for over 50 years. With its multiple additional products and services, this provider is ideal for those looking to customize their service. Cox Communications stands out for its flexible plan options and commitment to customization, which account for 21% of our methodology. The competitive pricing, complemented by a $14.99 monthly discount for Cox Mobile plan subscribers, makes it a strong contender. Furthermore, Cox’s inclusion of a prepaid internet option and various discount plans for students and qualifying individuals adds to its appeal. Why We Like It We’re impressed by Cox’s wide array of plan options, allowing for significant customization to meet diverse user needs. The standard inclusion of a gateway modem and Wi-Fi router, with free upgrades every three years, alongside the option for customers to use their own compatible routers, showcases Cox’s dedication to providing value and flexibility. The monthly discount for Cox Mobile subscribers and additional discount plans enhance its attractiveness for budget-conscious consumers. What We Don’t Like While Cox offers a range of benefits, its services might be limited by regional availability. Additionally, the reliance on provided equipment, unless opting for a personal router, could deter those seeking more autonomy over their hardware choices. Price increases after promotional periods might also affect long-term affordability. Who It’s Best For Cox Communications is an excellent choice for individuals looking for customizable internet solutions, particularly those already subscribed to or considering a Cox Mobile plan. Its student and qualifying individual discount plans also make it a viable option for those seeking quality internet service on a budget. Learn more: Cox Internet review Cox Communications’ internet connections are supported by the company’s growing fiber and hybrid networks. Plans start with speeds of 100 Mbps with a starting cost of $30. The company’s 1 Gig plan offers 1,000 Mbps speed starting at $95 monthly with discounts. Cox Communication’s 2 Gig plan is available in limited locations. We love that each plan is customizable for additional costs by adding unlimited data, tech support coverage, a movie streaming device, home security options or an ad-free TV upgrade. Customers on the BBB love Cox Communications’ helpful and kind customer service reps. However, some have noted unreliable service and that the company’s prices are constantly changing. As a tech entrepreneur deeply engaged with internet services to deliver our SaaS solutions, I recognize Cox Communications for their robust infrastructure and consistent internet speeds, which are crucial for cloud-based services like ours. However, their premium service tiers can be a drawback for consumers looking for budget-friendly options without compromising on speed or reliability.
— Ben Broch, Cox Communications user From our team’s experience, you can easily sign up for a Cox internet plan online. However, you’ll first need to verify their services are available in your areas, as they unfortunately don’t service a majority of the United States. To do this, you’ll simply just need to enter your address. If services are available in your area, you’ll be prompted to choose a plan, select any equipment you’ll want or need and add any extras you might want, like a subscription to Max. If Cox Communications doesn’t serve your area, you’ll be sent to one of their partner internet providers, like Spectrum or Xfinity. Signing up is easy, but you you run into any issues along the way, a live chat is available to help you or you can all their phone number to get over-the-phone support from an agent. 	Best for Affordable Bundles Best for Affordable Bundles Spectrum    Serving 41 states across the nation, Spectrum is noteworthy in part for its widespread availability. Plans come in three tiers starting at around $50 per month along with multiple options for bundling. All plans include unlimited data futher sweetening the deal. Spectrum’s expansive availability across over half of the United States, accounting for 15% of its overall score, positions it prominently in the market. Its appealing bundle options, incorporating both internet and mobile cellular services, cater to a broad audience looking for comprehensive connectivity solutions. Although it lacks fiber options, Spectrum compensates with high-speed cable internet at competitive rates. Why We Like It The inclusion of a modem in every plan stands out, offering essential hardware without extra costs. Spectrum’s flexibility is further demonstrated through its professional installation service and the option for a self-installation kit, priced at $24.99, catering to varying customer preferences. Its bundling options, combining internet with cellular services, provide significant value and convenience. What We Don’t Like The requirement for a two-year contract to access the best pricing may deter customers seeking more flexibility. Additionally, the lack of a built-in Wi-Fi option in the base plan, requiring an extra $5 monthly fee for this service, could be seen as a drawback. The absence of fiber internet options may also limit those in search of the highest speeds. Who It’s Best For Spectrum is ideal for customers in its wide service area seeking reliable cable internet with the convenience of bundled mobile services. It suits those who are comfortable committing to a two-year contract for better pricing and prefer the option to choose between professional installation or a DIY setup. Learn more: Spectrum Internet review Prices for Spectrum’s home internet services include the company’s mobile cellular service. Starting at $39.99 per month with a two-year agreement for a 300 Mbps connection, Spectrum also offers a 500 Mbps plan for $69.99 without a contract or a 1 Gbps plan for $10 less than that with one. Many customers on the BBB reported high satisfaction with Spectrum Internet, specifically noting the company’s top-notch customer service pros and extremely reliable connection. Alternatively, some negative reviews mention constantly increasing prices and difficulty canceling services. I run a business out of my home and have used Spectrum in mid-Michigan. I am usually quite happy with the service, as I don’t experience any lag with regard to video conferencing, even when my wife is streaming video on the television. Also, I don’t recall any outages in the 4+ years I have been a customer.
— Joe Karasin, Spectrum Internet user We wanted to see what the process was like for signing up for Spectrum, and we found it to be fairly simple to do online. Like signing up for most internet providers, the first step is to enter your address to ensure the company serves your area. If you’re covered, you’ll be able to see the plan options that are available in your area. We loved that Spectrum has a “help me choose” button which will give more specifics on each plan and help you decide which will work best for your needs. That said, there’s no real straightforward way to do a side-by-side comparison of the different plans that Spectrum offers on its site. Instead, you’ll have to click around a bit to get the information that you’re looking for on each. 	Best Fiber Internet Best Fiber Internet Google Fiber    Google Fiber is another great option for thoes looking for fast internet speeds at a competitive rate. Speeds start at 1 Gpbs and plans begin at $70 per month; however availability is limited to select metroplitan areas. Google Fiber earns its place for delivering exceptionally fast internet speeds reaching up to 8 Gbps, a standout feature despite its limited availability. The service predominantly offers 1 and 2 Gbps connections, with its ultra-fast 5 and 8 Gbps plans being more exclusive. Its significant emphasis on pricing and features, contributing to 50% of its overall score, highlights its competitive edge. Why We Like It The inclusion of a Wi-Fi router at no additional equipment fees across all plans, coupled with the provision of an extra 1 TB of cloud storage, significantly enhances the value proposition of Google Fiber. The promise of expanding coverage areas brings potential access to more users, making its high-speed internet more accessible over time. What We Don’t Like The primary drawback of Google Fiber is its limited availability, restricting access to its high-speed services to select areas. While the 5 and 8 Gbps plans offer groundbreaking speeds, their limited availability might disappoint customers outside of these select service areas. Who It’s Best For Google Fiber is best suited for users in its service areas seeking unparalleled internet speeds for bandwidth-intensive activities, such as streaming 4K content, online gaming and large file transfers. It’s also a great choice for tech-savvy consumers who can leverage the included cloud storage for additional value. Learn more: Google Fiber Internet review Google Fiber offers four plans, all with unlimited data. Each plan includes the cost of equipment. However, only the 1-Gig plan for $70 monthly and the 2-Gig plan for $100 are widely available in the areas where the network is available. The majority of customers had great things to say about Google Fiber. Many reviews on Consumer Affairs highlighted its affordability and amazing speed. However, some negative reviews reflect dissatisfaction with customer support. The gigabit speeds offered by Google Fiber are incredibly fast, providing seamless streaming, gaming and downloading experiences. One of the standout features of Google Fiber is its customer service. Another aspect I appreciate about Google Fiber is its commitment to transparency. The pricing is straightforward, with no hidden fees or surprises on the bill.
— Max Shak, Google Fiber user Per our research, we found that signing up for Google Fiber was easy. Right when you enter the company’s site, you’ll see a spot where you can enter your address to see what plans, if any, Google Fiber offers in your area. If they do serve your area, you’ll be taken to a screen where you can sign up, schedule your professional installation or request a kit for self-installation (which is available if you choose their 1 Gig plan). Once you schedule your appointment, the installation will take anywhere from one to two hours to complete. 	Best for Rural Areas Best for Rural Areas Kinetic    Kinetic is a desirable option for customers living in rural areas. Speeds and pricing can vary greatly depending on location, but the costs tend to be less than the satellite options also popular amongst remote residents. Plans start at around $40 per month and in select areas can reach speeds of up to 8 Gbps. Kinetic offers coverage across 18 states, with a special focus on rural regions often underserved by larger providers. The absence of contracts and data caps across its range of wireless, DSL, cable, fiber and hybrid connections stands out as a significant advantage. Why We Like It The flexibility in Kinetic’s internet speeds, from 500 Mbps to 8 Gbps, caters to a variety of user needs, although the highest speeds have limited reach. We appreciate the company’s efforts to make its services more affordable through a $10 discount for automatic payments and a further $2 off for opting for paperless billing, making Kinetic an attractive choice for budget-conscious consumers. What We Don’t Like A notable downside is the exclusion of modem rental fees from the monthly plans, which can add an unexpected cost to the overall service price. Additionally, while Kinetic offers high-speed options, the most rapid connections are not widely accessible, potentially limiting options for some customers. Who It’s Best For Kinetic is particularly well-suited for residents in its 18-state coverage area, especially those in rural locations looking for reliable internet without the commitment of a contract. Households with standard to high internet usage will find the 500 Mbps or 1 Gbps plans sufficient for their needs, while those eligible for the fastest speeds can enjoy top-tier internet performance. Learn more: Kinetic Internet review Kinetic’s plans include a 500 Mbps connection starting at $39.99 per month. The cost consists of promotional pricing and will likely increase after 12 months. The company’s 1 Gig plan is also subject to a price increase after 12 months, but the introductory price is $69.99 monthly. Faster speeds included in the 2 and 8-gig plans are only available in select locations. Most customers had overwhelmingly positive things to say about Kinetic Internet, many noting the exceptional customer service and technical support. However, other customers on Consumer Affairs noted slow internet speeds and yearly price increases. 	Best Satellite Internet Best Satellite Internet HughesNet    HughesNet uses its satellite internet network to focus on availability, allowing internet access to any household the satellite signal can reach. While the company’s connection speeds aren’t the fastest on the market, topping out at 100 Mbps, if there’s no other home internet option available, HughesNet may be the solution. HughesNet captures our attention with its broad nationwide reach, providing satellite internet where traditional broadband might not be an option. Despite the higher entry costs, including equipment fees as high as $450, HughesNet’s participation in the Affordable Connectivity Program brings valuable discounts to eligible households, enhancing its appeal. Why We Like It With its recently updated plans, HughesNet provides speeds high enough to stream your favorite shows and work from home. We also like that each plan comes with unlimited data. Plus the company offers a choice between buying and leasing equipment, making the cost of entry somewhat more manageable. What We Don’t Like The initial cost barrier can be steep with HughesNet due to the high equipment plan prices compared to other providers. Additionally, the reliance on satellite technology can lead to latency issues, making it less ideal for real-time activities like gaming and video conferencing. Who It’s Best For HughesNet is best suited for users in remote or rural areas where traditional internet services are unavailable or unreliable. It’s also a solid option for those who can benefit from the Affordable Connectivity Program’s discounts and who mainly need internet access for browsing and streaming during off-peak hours to maximize the free data bonus. Learn more: HughesNet review HughesNet offers three different plans: Select, Elite and Fusion. The first two plans rely on satellite while the later uses a combination of satellite and wireless technology. Prices range from $74.99 to $10999 per month. However, the necessary two-year contract includes a $25 discount for the first 12 months. Many customers from Consumer Affairs noted HughesNet’s impressive reliability and helpful and responsive customer and tech support. However, many mentioned its expensive pricing and lack of follow-through for specific promotional offers. Upon visiting HughesNet’s site, we found it to be easy to use and navigate. Once you’ve confirmed HughesNet is available in your area, you’ll have the option to choose one of Hughesnet’s three main internet plans. We loved all the details provided for each plan, including a fine print and FAQs section for each, ensuring customers get a thorough overview of what each plan entails. We appreciate that HughesNet has uniform pricing across all regions, making plan comparison and decision-making easier. If you have any questions or need assistance along the way, the company strongly recommends using the call center for immediate assistance. Some users who may prefer digital chat options may see this as a drawback, as they don’t offer an online live- or bot-chat That said, the site it easy to follow and navigate and offers many resources for new and existing customers alike, like a place for managing billing and data usage and numerous resources for account management and service optimization. 	Best for Low-Capacity Internet Users Best for Low-Capacity Internet Users Mediacom    Available in 22 states, Mediacom is another fiber optic service provider to consider if you are looking for high speed options. While introductory pricing is good be wary of price hikes and data cap overage fees. Mediacom caught our attention with its flexible internet plans designed for households with varying data needs, offering high-speed options without forcing consumers into oversized data plans. This approach provides an economical solution for those who require speed but not necessarily extensive data capacity, with plans ranging from 200 GB to a generous 6,000 GB. Why We Like It The affordability of Mediacom’s plans stands out, particularly for users who manage their data consumption carefully. The structured data caps cater to a wide array of internet usage patterns, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious households. What We Don’t Like The data caps, while accommodating, come with a caveat; exceeding them leads to additional charges at a rate of $10 per extra 50 GB. This pricing structure could escalate costs for high-bandwidth activities like online gaming and streaming HD content, making Mediacom less appealing to heavy internet users. Who It’s Best For Mediacom is best suited for moderate internet users who prioritize speed without the need for unlimited data. It’s an excellent choice for individuals who engage in standard internet activities such as browsing and emailing, but less so for those with high data consumption habits, like streaming enthusiasts and gamers. Learn More: Mediacom Internet Review Mediacom offers four plans that vary by speed and data capacity. The entry-level Internet 100 plan costs $19.99 per month for the first year and increases to $29.99 afterward. The company’s most robust plan costs $59.99 to start and $99.99 after 12 months. It includes 6,000 GB of data with speeds of up to 1 Gbps and 20-plus device connectivity. Many customers on the BBB reported high satisfaction with Mediacom, specifically noting its internet reliability and courteous customer service people. Alternatively, some negative reviews mention constantly increasing prices and weak internet signals. Learn more: Mediacom review Mediacom has carved a niche in the U.S. broadband market, particularly in regions underserved by larger ISPs. This strategic focus on suburban and rural areas gives them a unique advantage, enabling them to build a dedicated customer base that appreciates their presence in less competitive markets. However, Mediacom faces challenges typical of medium-sized ISPs, such as variability in service quality and customer support issues. While they offer competitive pricing and decent speeds, the inconsistency in service reliability can be a significant drawback for consumers looking for uninterrupted connectivity, especially in today’s high-demand digital environments.
— Michael Collins, Mediacom user An ISP brings internet information into a home or service area where the data is accessible by a modem and router. An ISP’s responsibility typically ends at the modem, where internet users can install a router to complete the internet connection and transfer data to devices. Devices in the home connect to the router through a wired connection or Wi-Fi signal. Most ISPs offer multiple connection plans for which they charge a monthly fee. Some provide other equipment or services and allow customers to bundle services for discounted pricing. ISPs vary prices based on the type and speed of the connection as well as how much data the customer uses. Taking all of this in consideration it an be difficult to choose an internet service provider. Below are some of the factors you should consider when making a decision. While most of the country can access the internet from home one way or another, few ISPs are available in more than half of the country. That means you’ll likely have to choose from one or a few available where you live. Start your search by identifying the ISPs available to you. Depending on how you use the internet, speed is often the most important factor outside of availability. The connection speed you choose will affect how you can use the internet and the price you’ll pay. Useful internet connection speeds vary from about 5 Mbps to over 1,000 Mbps. Slower internet speeds are sufficient for checking email and basic internet browsing. Faster speeds are necessary for gaming, video streaming and transferring large files. According to our streaming statistics, Americans spend an average of three hours and nine minutes a day streaming digital media, so it’s important to choose internet speeds that accommodate these needs. The fastest speeds available come through fiber optic networks and can reach up to 8,000 Mbps or 8 Gbps. Cost is typically closely tied to connection speed and data availability. Faster connections and larger data caps, including unlimited monthly data, are more expensive than slower connections with less data available. Customers can control costs somewhat by purchasing slower connections with less speed. Some ISPs allow customers to purchase their own modem and router to eliminate the associated monthly rental costs. Choosing a reliable connection and provider can mean the difference between a useful connection and utter frustration. For those who rely on having internet available at all times, check local reviews or FCC reports regarding broadband reliability before committing to an ISP. Many ISPs are also communication companies. Communication companies may offer cable television, cellular phone service or landlines. Most of these providers allow consumers to bundle their internet connection with one or more of these additional services to take advantage of reduced pricing. A data cap set by an ISP is the amount of data your connection plan allows. When the data cap is reached and surpassed, your ISP may throttle your connection. Throttling means to slow the connection speed dramatically. While many ISPs offer unlimited data, few provide truly unlimited data with no speed throttling. Some ISPs allow customers to purchase more data after reaching their cap to avoid slower connection speeds. Available internet connection types include 4G LTE, satellite, fixed wireless, DSL, 5G, cable and fiber optic. Depending on where you live and your precise location, one or several of those might be available. The type you choose can affect your overall connection speed and reliability. 4G LTE is a slower cellular connection available in many locations. Fiber, on the other hand, features high speeds but is only available in limited areas. ISP contracts are falling out of favor. Many providers now offer month-to-month terms and may promise pricing discounts or other perks for a specific duration after signing up for service. However, some holdouts still require customers to sign a one or two-year contract. Contracts are more common in areas with few internet connection options. If you must sign one, read and understand the details before committing. Several types of connections are available through various ISPs. Each connection type has its own pros and cons. Choosing an internet service type often comes down to what’s available in your location and the connection speed you desire versus how much you’re willing to spend. While the type of connection and your location play a role in pricing, the cost of internet service depends mostly on its connection speed. Typical prices range from about $40 to $90 monthly for internet connections with speeds under 1,000 Mbps or 1 Gbps. The cost for speeds over 1 Gbps generally starts at around $100 and can reach over $300 per month. Internet costs can add up and knowing how to negotiate and lower your bills is a good skill to have. Here are a few tips to consider. An internet connection is one thing, but having all of your wireless, television, streaming, gaming and other services together in one package is another. Communications companies that offer the best bundle deals combine internet with television, phone and other services and sell them at discounts to consumers. Getting a good bundling deal depends on which and how much of each service you’ll use. If you don’t use a landline anymore and one of the bundling components in a package is just that, it may not be worth spending money on it to secure an internet discount. Both large and small ISPs and communication companies offer bundles. It would be a stretch to say that every one of them does. However, most do offer some sort of discount for choosing more than just an internet connection. Of the ISPs we evaluated, the following companies offer service bundling packages. Our list of best internet providers for gaming and streaming includes: We’ve found the best providers for rural areas include: A recent Forbes Home survey found that as of 2024, there are 5.35 billion internet users worldwide and the number of internet users is expected to reach 7.9 billion by 2029. Users are accessing the internet through various devices, spending an average of four hours on their mobile device, two hours on connected TV devices, and over an hour on a desktop device every day.  In terms of age, recent statistics from the Pew Research Center reported that access to the internet has proved to be significantly impactful on a variety of age groups. Among individuals aged 18 to 29, a remarkable 97% have internet access, highlighting the significance of online connectivity among younger demographics. Moreover, those aged 30 to 49 show even greater connectivity, with an impressive 98% having internet access. This trend extends into older age brackets, with 96% of Americans aged 50 to 64 having access to the internet, underscoring the widespread prevalence of digital connectivity across various age groups.  How we’re all utilizing the internet range and include shopping, schooling, working and of course, entertainment, to name a few. We’re in an era where we’re all consuming digital media as part of our daily lives, and a large part of that includes streaming. A recent Forbes Home survey found that Americans spend an average of three hours and nine minutes a day streaming digital media, and 99% of all U.S. households pay for at least one or more streaming services, the most popular being Netflix, with nearly 250 million subscribers, followed by Amazon Prime Video with 200 million subscribers and Disney+ with 150.2 million subscribers.

It’s important to pick an ISP that meets your household needs. If you have several devices connected to the internet, you might want faster download speeds. If you work from home, you might need certain speeds in order to complete your work. If you want additional services outside of internet service, look at providers who bundle phone and television. The FCC defines broadband internet as 25 Mbps download speed and 3 Mbps upload speed. However, many suggest having speeds of at least 100 Mbps and upload speeds of 10 Mbps. A home with 100 Mbps download speed should be able to game, stream video and participate in video conferencing at the same time without any issue. It depends on the type of service you choose. DSL or cable connections can mean simply hooking up a phone cord or a cable to a modem to install internet service. Installing satellite service might require a little more know-how and handiness, though you can install satellite internet devices on your own. Fiber internet usually requires a technician to install a utility box so you can connect to the internet. Our list of fastest internet service providers includes: • Google Fiber
• AT&T Internet
• Xfinity
• Cox
• Fios by Verizon
