 I wanted to share some outlook data with you regarding where the economy is headed in 2023 and really how do we make sense of where things will be going into the next 12 months based on the data that exists currently. Some factors that are in play currently that are important to keep in mind that will really be the driving force of 2023:  1.      The Fed remains focused on reducing inflation to their benchmark of 2% using the two tools they have (shrinking the balance sheet and increasing interest rates) 2.      The job market continues to be exceptionally strong in January (typically a month we see pull backs in the market after holiday layoffs for additional staff in retail) 3.      Prices remain high for CPI and Real Estate values – Summer months will be very telling (Overall inflation was up 6.4% YOY in January) 4.      Consumer credit card debt jumped 18.5% hitting a record $930.6 billion (The savings that was built during the height of the pandemic from all the “free” money has mostly dried up for consumers)  I think it’s best to unpackage each of these individually starting with the Fed’s focus on inflation reduction. In a typical market environment, the Fed would increase rates slowing the credit markets, and eventually inflation would start to come down. We are seeing some of that, but the runway that was given by the Federal Government with spending package after spending package has carried inflation much higher for much longer. The good news is that what the Fed is doing is working, but as Chairman Powell has insisted, this will be a long bumpy road to get inflation down. To bring this in retrospect I think a good place to start is to consider one of the biggest overall drivers of inflation, which is farming and food prices. To think of farming, the first place that I would take a look at is cropland and farm real estate values. They have both hit record highs with cropland now being at an average of $5,050 per acre, up 14% YOY (2021 was also a record year). The more expensive cropland is, inherently the more expensive food will be at the grocery store as farms continue to consolidate and the acquisition costs are drastically increased on a per acre basis.   2023 cropland values are projected to continue to rise. Couple that with what we are seeing in commodities across the Board, which the three staple crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat) are all projected to see price increases in 2023 as well as beef will increase further. There is some relief in sight as both pork and chicken are projected to come down somewhat in price, however they too will remain at high levels. Looking at the graph below and comparing work stocks vs. usage ratios, you can see that usage and production are almost even. In order to get these prices down we need to see stocks go up (basic supply vs. demand), however with the war in Ukraine persisting and Russian crops not making it to market, we are seeing some drastic price increases across the globe since the start of the war and that is expected to continue throughout 2023.  Then we mix in the high usage of consumer debt, particularly credit card debt which with every rate hike we see will put further strain on consumers and spending, and this leads to the start of the catalyst of inflation eventually coming down, but based on the data and the runway that exists currently, it does not appear that inflation will come down to the target 2% Fed mark until at some point into 2024. So the big question that is on everyone’s mind is what will happen with interest rates?  The market differs greatly from the Fed and the markets have a strong sense of doubt that the Fed will continue to increase interest rates. We have seen a rally over the last three weeks since the Fed meeting with 2 year treasury rates going up over 60bps and 10 year treasury rates going up 55bps over that same period. As you can see though by looking at the two charts below, there are points in the market that there is opportunity to lock in rates and save 50-60bps. That is why its very helpful if we start to strategize on rates months before you are actually ready to Borrow funds from CoBank as I will be able to help save you, but more importantly your members a lot of money in interest expense just by following the markets and helping you to lock in low rates at the most opportune times.  Lastly, I think that it’s important to note that the market has built in several rate decreases towards the back half of 2023. Given where inflation is at and knowing what the Fed’s goals are and how long it will take to get there, I think it’s important to consider that if the market is wrong, we will see a shift in rates which will drive up the commercial rate markets later this year. There will still be windows to take advantage of, however they might get a bit tighter to capture. Would love any feedback you have on this as I am an economist at heart and love this data!  Have a great week and reach out with questions as I am always happy to help!
