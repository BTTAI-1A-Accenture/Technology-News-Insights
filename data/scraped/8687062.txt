 By BRENT STUBBS Senior Sports Reporter bstubbs@tribunemedia.net In one of the most dramatic comebacks at this year’s Bahamas Baseball Association’s G-Ball National Baseball Championships, the Junior Baseball League of Nassau stunned Freedom Farm to clinch the 14-and-under divisional title. Down 6-0 in the top of the fourth inning with a change in umpires, the JBLN rallied to tie the score at 6-6 and 7-7 before they held on for an 11-10 victory yesterday at the Baillou Hills Sporting Complex. Jordan Miller, who played on the infield and ended up on the mound for the save, finished with a 2-for-4 day at the plate with a run batted in and two runs scored as he earned the Most Valuable Player award. “We knew we could beat this team. They beat us yesterday (Saturday), but it was by errors, so we knew once we cut down the errors, this team could not beat us,” said JBLN manager Ken Adderley. “They were trying to tell us that this nationals is Freedom Farm, but we wanted to tell them it is not so. I used to win the 13-14 division all the time. If they want to name the nationals the Freedom Farm League, then they need to name the 13-14 the Ken Adderley League.” Alfred Smith and Anthony Cleare were also 2-for-4 with a run scored and Treveil Roberts was 1-for-2 with two runs scored to help out in the win.  In a losing effort, Ethan North went 1-for-3 with two RBI and a pair of runs scored. While the younger age groups played their games at the Baillou Hills Sporting Complex, the 16-and-under and 20-and-under played at the new Andre Rodgers Baseball Stadium. JBLN also got a big game from their 20-and-under team as they brought the curtain down on the four days of competition with a 7-1 win over Freedom Farm under the lights at the stadium. Isaacs Fox was a perfect 2-for-2 with a RBI and two runs scored, Joel Miller was 1-for-2 with two runs scored and Norman Bastian was 1-for-3 with a run scored. Roberto Lamour scored the lone run for Freedom Farm, who got a 1-for-3 night with a RBI from Frankie Moree. Rivon Saunders was also 1-for-3. And in the under-16 division, Freedom Farm roughed up Grand Bahama’s  Legacy with an 11-2 rout as Earvin Darville was a perfect 3-for-3 with two RBI and two runs scored. Ladanian McKenzie was 2-for-3 with two RBI and a run scored and Tajahari Wilson was 1-for-3 with two RBI and a run scored for Legacy. In the 12-and-under division, the Grand Bahama Little League pounded JBLN 11-4 with pitcher Malique Israel helping his own cause for the MVP honours with a 2-for-3 day with two RBI and a run scored,. “This team is a great team. They put in the work at least four days a week and they do everything necessary to win,” said GBLL manager Donovan Cox. “We came into the tournament very confident that we would win. We came here with about five or six big arms. I knew that we could go one through 14 and we could get the pitching. I could have started any of the guys and I knew we could win it. This is the first time that we’ve won the divisional title for a long time. Hopefully this is the start of something new for us.” Jeremiah Filterman and Kymari Rolle both were 1-for-3 with a run scored apiece to pace the losers. The 10-and-under division saw Freedom Farm prevail with a 12-0 whitewashing of Legacy.  Xavier Petit was a perfect 2-for-2 with three RBI and a pair of runs scored and Isaacs Richardson was 1-for-3 with a RBI and two runs score. Aidon Williams went 1-for-2 in the loss. • Here’s a look at the results of games played during the tournament:  Under-8 Coach Pitch  division Preliminary games played - Freedom Farm def.
