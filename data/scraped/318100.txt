As digitalization continues to increase in all sectors in China, so do security risks. Zhou Hongyi, a member of the 14th CPPCC National Committee and founder of cybersecurity company 360 Security Group, said cyberattacks launched by hackers backed by foreign governments have become the biggest threat to China's cybersecurity. Many companies and organizations only notice the attacks when there is a data leak. The country needs to ensure such invisible attacks can be detected more accurately in the future to prevent devastating losses.
