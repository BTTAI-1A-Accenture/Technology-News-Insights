A primary school teacher has tragically taken her own life — with her grief-stricken family taking aim at the education system. A primary school teacher from Perth has tragically taken her own life — with her grief-stricken family laying the blame on the education system. Nicole Naeslund, 36, was a teacher at Middle Swan Primary School when she took stress leave before eventually quitting her job. The young teacher took her life earlier this month, with her family claiming stress and ongoing issues with her job had factored into her decision. Ms Naeslund’s family said while she had battled mental health issues before, they had sharply risen within the last five years. In an interview with The West Australian, Ms Naeslund’s mother Noeleen Hamilton said her daughter hadn’t been supported the way she should have been by the education system. “She loved teaching and she always wanted to go back to teaching at some stage but the system let her down,” she said. “I’m not saying the Education Department is 100 per cent to blame but she just didn’t get any support when she needed it the most. “She was just a beautiful person and she cared about so many people and especially children.” The WA Education Department has stated that they are aware of Ms Naeslund’s death and have expressed their condolences. “The Department of Education is aware of the death of a former Middle Swan Primary School staff member and sends its condolences to her family, friends and colleagues,” the department stated. “The staff member had resigned from her position prior to her death.” A major report released today has revealed just how “bleak” the future looks for Gen Z.
