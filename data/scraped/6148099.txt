BERKELEY, NJ â€” The community is rallying around a local family after their 7-year-old daughter was diagnosed with cancer. In March 2023, the DeLorenzo family found out their daughter, Sophia Grace, was diagnosed with B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, according to a GoFundMe. "She was born a warrior already being born with Down Syndrome," family friend Summit Tognetti wrote in the fundraiser. As father Steve DeLorenzo is president of the Berkeley Girls Softball League, they have announced a one-day friendly tournament "Swinging for Sophia" to help raise money for their "Sunshine Warrior." "This warrior has already begun her fight against cancer and she has a whole community ready to support her," the league wrote. The tournament is set for May 13 at Veterans Park. You can register here. If you are unable to attend but would still like to help, you can donate to the GoFundMe or message the league for donation items needed for the tournament. "The Delorenzo family are some of the most amazing people I have ever met and this news broke many hearts around our community," Tognetti wrote in the fundraiser. "They are the first people to lend a helping hand to anyone in need." To donate to the GoFundMe, click here. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
