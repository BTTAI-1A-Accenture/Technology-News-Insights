 Back in 2007, while studying for my BBA, I found E-Commerce to be the most interesting subject. E-Commerce refers to commercial transactions conducted over the internet. If we look back to the late 90s, it was challenging and hectic to buy and sell products. The concept of brands was not as prevalent, making it difficult for both buyers and sellers. E-Commerce was well-known in other countries, with websites like Amazon in the USA and Asda, George, and Primark in the UK serving as great examples. Fast forward to 2023, we now live in a world surrounded by electronic transactions. We can not only buy and sell but also pay bills through our smartphones, making life easier for everyone. In today's world, the job market is highly competitive, making finding a job quite challenging. In a country like Pakistan, where the inflation rate is rising and the economy is facing a downfall, it's becoming increasingly hard for individuals to survive. Many are considering leaving the country, but not everyone sees that as a good option. This is where the idea of starting an online business comes in. When launching an e-commerce venture, it's crucial to understand the essential aspects and traits of the local e-commerce landscape. Here are some key attributes of Pakistan’s e-commerce sector: 1. Rapid Development: As more people adopt online buying, the e-commerce sector in Pakistan is expected to grow substantially, contributing to the country’s development. 2. Large Consumer Base: With a population of over 220 million, mainly youth, Pakistan presents a prime market for e-commerce businesses. 3. Increasing Internet Consumption: More people are using the internet for various purposes, including online purchases, indicating an increase in internet penetration. 4. Government Support: The Pakistani government has implemented regulations and initiatives to boost the growth of e-commerce, making it easier for businesses to operate and thrive. 5. Mobile Commerce: Mobile phones are widely used in Pakistan, and mobile commerce is gaining popularity, presenting great potential for e-commerce companies. 6. Cash on Delivery: Cash on delivery is the preferred payment method for many Pakistani online shoppers, making it essential for e-commerce businesses to offer this option. Next Steps: With the rapidly growing digital landscape in the country, starting an online store can be a lucrative venture. To help with this, here’s a six-step formula to guide you through the process: Step 1: Understand current e-commerce trends in Pakistan Step 2: Choose the right product to sell online in Pakistan Step 3: Source your product to sell online Step 4: Select the best e-commerce platforms for Pakistan Step 5: Launch your product online Step 6: Market your e-commerce products Following these steps can assist you in starting an online business.
