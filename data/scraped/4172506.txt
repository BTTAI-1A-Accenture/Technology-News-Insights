Here is what Tweedy, Browne has to say about Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) in its Q1 2023 investor letter: “Many, if not most, stocks held in the Funds’ portfolios performed quite well in the first quarter. This was particularly true for the Funds’ non-US equity holdings, many of which have come into their own over the last two quarters, despite years of underperformance versus their US counterparts – a welcome shift given that our Funds’ portfolios have been somewhat non-US-centric in terms of their portfolio allocations for well over a decade. The Funds also received a long overdue boost from their Chinese and Hong Kong-based holdings in the wake of China’s reopening and the government’s signaling of a relaxation of their interventionist policies. This included strong returns in Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) among others.” science-in-hd-T2XeWHGZ7xU-unsplash Our calculations show that Baidu, Inc.
