We have more newsletters Police have made a number of arrests after eco activists reportedly glued themselves to a road outside an oil refinery. Members of the campaign group This is Rigged posted on Twitter this morning to say they were blocking the supply of fuel to the plant in Grangemouth, Scotland. Video footage at the scene shows a group of people on the road with police officers in attendance, the Daily Record reports. The tweet reads: "BREAKING: THIS IS RIGGED CONCRETED TO ROAD BLOCK FUEL SUPPLY. "6 people are currently concreted and glued to the single access road to INEOS Grangemouth oil terminal." The campaign group says its demands are to stop the Scottish Government allowing new fossil fuel projects in Scotland, and for Holyrood to create a "clear and fully funded transition" for oil and gas workers. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "We are aware of protestors at the Ineos site in Grangemouth. A number of arrests have been made and officers remain in attendance." Footage from the scene shows police officers watching on while sirens sound in the background. Someone is on the ground with the protesters, although it is not clear if they are trying to keep them their or help remove the glue.
