Samsung has been reportedly prioritising the development of special OLED panels that will be used in certain iPad models in 2024.  



 Earlier, the tech giant wanted to make full-cut OLED panels, but post looking at the potential demand for OLED panels for the upcoming iPads, Samsung has started the development of two-stack tandem OLED panels, reports SamMobile. Reports have further stated that these panels might further be used in some Apple Macs as well. Two-stack tandem OLED panels include two layers of pixels instead of one and this hybrid technology will offer higher brightness and longer life than existing OLED panels which are used in smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, TVs and laptops. OLED panels have a shorter lifespan and burn-in issues, and Apple wants to solve those issues with new panels. The two-stack OLED panels that Apple will use are less advanced than full-cut OLED panels.
