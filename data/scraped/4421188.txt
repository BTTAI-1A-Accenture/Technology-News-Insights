 We have a list of the new Hulu movies and shows arriving in April 2023 including two major new original series.
 Hulu’s list of new releases for April 2023 don’t feature many blockbusters, but if we dig a little, I’m sure we can find some gems.  Perhaps the most promising items are on the TV side of things. Tiny Beautiful Things premieres on April 7 and stars Kathryn Hahn as “a floundering writer who becomes a revered advice columnist while her own life is falling apart.” That will be followed by comedy Am I Being Unreasonable? on April 11 and two documentaries: high school football story Algiers, America (April 19) and Tupac Shakur piece Dear Mama (April 22).  The best TV candidate this month, however, is probably Saint X on April 26. This series, told via multiple timelines, “explores and upends the girl-gone-missing genre as it explores how a young woman’s mysterious death during an idyllic Caribbean vacation creates a traumatic ripple effect that eventually pulls her surviving sister into a dangerous pursuit of the truth.” Hulu’s big original movie this month is Quasi on April 20, which will tell the story of a hapless hunchback yearning for love. There are also plenty of intriguing library movie titles including April 1 launches American Psycho, Dredd, and Lincoln. Later on, TV comfort watchers get a major boost when the complete series of New Girl comes to Hulu on April 17. Ad Ad – content continues below Here is everything else coming to Hulu this month.
