Android Headlines / Android News / Android Phones / Doogee V30, S99 & T20 are now available to purchase Doogee has just announced that three of its new devices are now available. The Doogee V30, S99, and T20 are available to purchase just in time for the holidays. Best of all, they’re available at a discount. All three devices are available from both AliExpress and DoogeeMall, but the discounts apply to AliExpress only, so keep that in mind. Another thing to note is that this promo period applies for only two days, December 22 and 23. We’ll talk about each of the devices separately below.  The Doogee V30 is now priced at $279 at AliExpress, while its regular price tag is $399. It’s also available via DoogeeMall. This phone does support an eSIM feature, and it includes a truly gigantic 10,800mAh battery. It also has a rather interesting-looking rear camera design, and a waterdrop display notch. It is a rugged smartphone that also supports 66W charging for that large battery. The MediaTek Dimensity 900 fuels the Doogee V30, while Doogee included 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. You can expand both its RAM (virtually), and storage (up to 2TB, via microSD card). A 108-megapixel main camera is included, along with a 20-megapixel night vision camera. A 16-megapixel ultrawide camera also sits on the back. A single 32-megapixel camera can be found on the front. This phone also includes a 6.58-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate. It is IP68/IP69K certified, while it also offers MIL-STD-810G certification. Android 12 comes pre-installed.  The Doogee S99 can now be yours for only $179, if you get it from AliExpress, but it’s also available from DoogeeMall. The device’s regular price tag is $329. This smartphone includes a 108-megapixel main camera, a 64-megapixel night vision camera, and a 32-megapixel selfie camera. A 6,000mAh battery is also included, and 33W charging supported. 15W wireless charging is also supported here. A 6.3-inch display is included on the Doogee S99, while Android 12 comes pre-installed. The MediaTek G96 fuels the phone, while Doogee included 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. You can expand its RAM virtually, and storage via a microSD card. This phone is also IP68/IP69K and MIL-STD-810G certified. It has a side-facing fingerprint scanner too.  The Doogee T20 is the company’s new tablet. This tablet can be yours for $149, if you get it from AliExpress, but it’s also available from DoogeeMall. Its regular price tag is $319, by the way. The Doogee T20 is the company’s second tablet in 2022. It features a 10.4-inch QHD display with TUV certification.
