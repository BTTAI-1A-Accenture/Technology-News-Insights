19th Aug, 2024 The planned development of the new school campus will include two school buildings opposite each other with a central courtyard and a new multi Use Games Area (MUGA). The school has been prioritised for redevelopment by the governmentâ€™s Department for Education under their new School Rebuilding Programme, which proposes major rebuilding and refurbishing of schools and sixth forms across England. An assessment of the school determined the existing building to be in poor condition with urgent action required. The new proposed development will include ICT suites, art, design and technology classes, science labs, a music room and drama studio, a library, a sports hall with a fitness suite and activity studio, a sixth form study room and dedicated Special Educational Needs department. The new MUGA will include four tennis courts, a netball court, three basketball courts and an Under 7/8, 5 a side football pitch. There will be parking access on site for 100 cars, unchanged from the existing site. Under the plans, the school will remain open during the phased demolition and redevelopment of the site.
