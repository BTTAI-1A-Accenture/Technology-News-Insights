The 53-year-old star shared new campaign images of her posing in just a pair of lace-up JLo Jennifer Lopez for Revolve shoes and nothing else, on her brand's Instagram. “Starting the week right with new #JLOJenniferLopez for @revolve pics 😍,” the post’s caption reads.

For her birthday last year, the actress shared a video of herself, including a shot where she posed naked, for her JLo Body line. She also posed topless in December for her beauty line. The campaign shots were always classy, of course, and a testament to the star's self-care regimen: Lopez spoke about how she sees herself at 50 during an interview in December 2020 with ELLE.com and other reporters while promoting her skincare line. “You never want to hear you look great for 50,” she said. “They want to just hear you look great, no matter what age you are. And for me and for the company, that is a big part of it. We don't want people going, you look great for 60, 50, 40, 35. You want people to just go, wow, you look amazing. That's part of our goal—to help everybody feel they look amazing no matter what age they are ,so we don't have to hear about that so much. It doesn't become such a big deal. ‘Oh my God, she's 50.’ It's like, does it matter? You're just your best self, no matter what.” Lopez added that she hasn't used Botox, although one dermatologist first encouraged her to get it in her 20s. “I was dating this guy,” she recalled. “He went to one dermatologist and I went to another dermatologist. Basically, my dermatologist gave me a great cleanser and some sunscreen and said, ‘If you do this from now on, your skin is healthy, you're young right now, it's going to be great.’ And he's like, ‘But the sunscreen is the thing.’ “And then I went to this other doctor with the boyfriend, and again, I was 20-something years old, and I haven't ever had Botox to this day,” she continued. “And she said, ‘Did you know you have a little line right here? We should start Botox.’ I mean, I had to be 23 years old, right? And I was like, ‘I'm going to pass.’ I didn't like needles anyway, but the boyfriend's like, ‘Yeah, you should start it. I do that.’ I was like, no, thank you. And I just wonder what would've happened to me if I would've started Botox at 23, what I would look like right now. My face would be a totally different face today.” "One of the big things I would encourage everybody to do from the time they're 15 years old, even younger, is wear sunscreen every day,” she continued, before highlighting one of her own products. “We developed a sunscreen you can wear every single day as your day moisturizer, and that is going to protect you more than anything. That's a big skincare secret that people kind of do but don't do. They use moisturizers, but they don't put on sunscreen every day. That is something I have done from that time I was 22 years old.” You can read more on Lopez's skincare routine here. 35 Resistance Band Workouts for Full-Body Toning Denise Austin on Staying ‘Flexible’ Over 50 This Massage Gun With 40,000 Reviews Is On Sale Best Hoka Sales in August 2024 Jennifer Garner Shares ‘Marvel Fit’ Workouts Stanley’s LoveShackFancy Collab Just Dropped A Personal Trainer’s Top 20 Chair Exercises Denise Austin Shares Over-50 Core Exercises These Adjustable Dumbbells Are 40% Off Hoka Clifton 9 Review The Best Treadmill Shoes of 2024 14 Best Shoes for Standing All Day A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back. ©2024 Hearst Magazines, Inc.
