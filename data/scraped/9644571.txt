 We’re monitoring the possibility of extreme weather in places that are important to you. We show  risk in three tiers: Some risk, there is at least some chance of extreme weather in the area; Moderate risk, it is likely that damaging weather will happen in the area; and High risk, extreme, dangerous weather is expected in the area. When forecasters see a risk of tornadoes, hail, high winds, excessive rain, hurricanes, tropical storms, unhealthy heat or winter storm conditions for any of the places you care about, we’ll send you a morning email to help you plan ahead. Read more about the risk categories and types of notices we send. Some

 Add places to see a detailed risk outlook. We aim to send one email per day on days when risks are forecast for one or more of your places. Our hope is that the emails are useful for your planning and awareness. Risk outlooks may change throughout the day, sometimes after we have sent you an email, though this page will contain updated information. This service does not provide alerts about immediate threats or danger; you can get those by monitoring local weather reports, listening to a weather radio or having National Weather Service alerts delivered to your mobile phone. The risk levels shown are derived from categories used in the outlooks issued by the National Weather Service, including those for severe weather from the Storm Prediction Center and excessive rainfall, winter storm conditions and unhealthy heat from the Weather Prediction Center. Some of these categories have been combined to create a clear, consistent language across multiple weather hazards. For example, the yellow level (representing some risk) includes the Weather Service categories for “marginal” and “slight” risk of severe storms and excessive rainfall; the orange level (moderate risk) includes the category for “enhanced” risk of severe storms and “moderate” risk of excessive rainfall; and the red level (high risk) includes the categories for “moderate” risk of severe storms and “high” risk of severe storms and excessive rainfall. The risk level may be adjusted upwards when the Weather Service predicts a higher likelihood of larger tornadoes or hail. In some cases the Weather Service’s narrower categories are considered for written descriptions. The map labeled “severe storms” combines risks for hail, high winds and tornadoes. Separate risk maps for those hazards are available only for the present day and tomorrow.
