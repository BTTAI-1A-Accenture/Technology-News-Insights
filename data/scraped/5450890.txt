Britain's Got Talent began in 2007 and had a completely different judging panel. Simon Cowell and Amanda Holden, who still sit on the judging panel today, were originally joined by Piers Morgan. However, after Piers left, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon joined the line-up. BGT has been a huge hit with viewers since it began, but who won the first show in 2007 and where are they now?

The mobile phone salesman wowed the panel with his rendition of Nessun Dorma. And while they were dubious at first, as soon as Paul sang his first note, they knew he was a potential winner. He even left Amanda in floods of tears, while the audience gave him a standing ovation. Simon said at the time: "So you work at Carphone Warehouse and you did that, I was not expecting that.

"I think if you keep singing like that you are going to be one of the favourites to win the whole competition." Since his first audition, Paul stormed through to the final and won the ITV series. But his success didn't stop there, and according to Celebrity Net Worth in 2022, Paul has an estimated net worth of Â£ 8.2 million. After performing for the late Queen Elizabeth II, Paul was invited back to the Royal Albert Hall in 2012 to celebrate 100 years of the Royal Variety Performance. He has also sung with the likes of Katherine Jenkins before going on to release his debut album One Chance, which went double Platinum, topping the charts in nine countries around the world. He also went on to release six further albums. We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He even managed to reach the final of America's Got Talent: The Champions in 2019. According to Paul's Instagram, the BGT winner recently travelled to New Zealand to perform. Sharing a snap from his dressing room, he penned: "Part way through the first of 12 shows in New Zealand. Unusual for me to do Nessun Dorma so early in a show. Am doing some acting also hence why I have been in NZ longer than normal before a tour." (sic) Britain's Got Talent returns tonight at 8pm on ITV.
