Genshin Impact's version 3.8 update focuses on its yearly summer event, this time featuring a new limited-time location, Veluriyam Mirage, instead of the Golden Apple Archipelago, unlike previous years. Additionally, while the heavily TCG-focused patch was the previous patch, being 3.7, Genshin Impact continues to expand the Genius Invokation TCG by adding a new set of cards even in this update. Specifically, in this patch, three new playable characters, namely Kaedehara Kazuha, Yanfei, and Candace, have been added to the roster, alongside some support deck cards.

                     With the newly released cards, Kaedehara Kazuha has already captured the interest of players, considering that he is also a powerful Anemo support unit in Genshin Impact's actual gameplay. In the TCG, he assumes a similar role as his kit enables crowd control and provides additional damage support through both his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst. This makes him a versatile addition to many team compositions, capable of fulfilling various roles in different situations.
                         Kazuha's Character and Talent cards are readily available to all players without any level requirements. Obtaining these cards simply involves inviting Kazuha and winning a match against him at Cat's Tail using a Match Invitation Letter. Furthermore, players can unlock his talent card by completing additional objectives. With the introduction of the new game mode Forge Realm's Temper, players have the opportunity to collect additional currency and acquire a sufficient number of Match Invitation Letters for their favorite characters.

                         Poetics of Fuubutsu is an exceptional talent card that beautifully reflects Kazuha's actual gameplay, as it enhances the Elemental DMG of the infused element. With this talent card, the entire team can effortlessly deal more damage, greatly assisting in defeating opponents swiftly, regardless of the content. Therefore, incorporating this card into the deck, especially in compositions that focus on Swirl or mono-element strategies alongside Anemo, can be incredibly advantageous. Players should strongly consider adding it to their support deck.
                         Kazuha, being a support character, allows him to seamlessly fit into a wide range of deck compositions, making him incredibly versatile. With his ability to utilize Swirl, Kazuha decks can effectively force opponents to switch active characters, making them disruptive and capable of breaking combo plays. Moreover, Kazuha's Elemental Skill provides the team with additional quick-swap abilities, enabling smooth transitions to the next character. Surprisingly, Kazuha synergizes well with other Anemo characters like Venti, a synergy not often seen in the actual gameplay of Genshin Impact. While the following decks are considered among the best, it's important to note that they may lack some defensive capabilities. It is important to note that Kazuha card should be placed right before the character players are interested in swapping for combo-purposes.
                         This deck composition, which combines three support characters, proves to be highly effective due to its immense potential for Swirl Damage and disruptive gameplay. This composition functions in a similar manner to the previously popular option featuring Xiao, albeit with some notable differences. Instead of relying primarily on Xiao's plunge damage and the need for frequent swapping, players can now switch more rapidly between characters thanks to Kazuha. Nevertheless, Kazuha can still benefit from plunging attacks since he can infuse them with Anemo and swirl even further.

                     The key to the deck's success lies in the exceptional synergy between Venti and Kazuha, facilitating seamless character swaps with the assistance of dice management. Shenhe's kit further enhances the composition by ensuring that both Kazuha and Venti can swirl Cryo, resulting in amplified damage through Shenhe's Icy Quills. Additionally, applying Cryo to opponents may lead to them being Frozen, particularly if they utilize characters such as Xingqiu or Kokomi, who apply Hydro to themselves when using their skills.
                         Electro-charged is a potent elemental reaction in the TCG, capable of consistently wearing down opponents' HP with piercing damage. While it may not match the fast-paced nature of the previous full-swirl deck, it still possesses significant damage-dealing capabilities thanks to the abilities of Yae Miko and Mona. In this composition, players have the option to swirl either Hydro or Electro, as both can be applied in similar manners. However, swirling Electro can prove more advantageous when combined with Kazuha's Talent Card effect, particularly due to Yae Miko's higher DMG potential with her Burst ability compared to Mona.
                         Conversely, players may opt to swirl Hydro instead, especially if their focus is on maximizing Yae Miko's Burst ability usage while simultaneously chipping away at the HP of characters already affected by Hydro. Those seeking a more defensive deck can also consider replacing Mona with Kokomi, who offers healing abilities while maintaining the potential for Hydro application.
                         Another effective deck for a mono-swirl elemental setup involves Raiden Shogun and Keqing alongside Kazuha. While some may argue in favor of using Sara due to her electro-support abilities, Kazuha proves more beneficial for players seeking a disruptive deck option. Raiden Shogun can summon for additional Electro DMG, but her primary advantage lies in providing energy to other characters upon activating her Burst. This greatly benefits both the Swirl potential from Kazuha and, more importantly, Keqing, whose powerful Elemental Burst can deliver AoE damage to defeat enemies en masse.

                     To maximize this combo, players should start with Raiden Shogun to quickly activate her Burst after using her Elemental Skill and normal attack, then switch to Kazuha for his Elemental Burst and Skill. This allows for an immediate swap to Keqing, enabling players to activate her Elemental Skill followed by her Burst. Thanks to Keqing's ability to generate quills allowing back to switch back to her, players can effectively perform quick swaps among all characters and follow this combo rotation, relying less on support cards to speed up the process and manage dice usage.
                         Since Kazuha is a support character, the optimal choice of action cards should depend more on the other team members rather than Kazuha himself. However, players may consider adding the "Plunging Strike" card, as it allows Kazuha to swirl with his normal attack, providing him with additional means to deal damage. Additionally, since the suggested team compositions generally do not include defensive characters capable of generating strong shields or providing healing, support cards with such abilities can prove invaluable.
                         As an Inazuma character, Kazuha benefits from the Inazuma Region action card when paired with other characters, which can further aid in dice management. It is still recommended for players to use cards such as "The Bestest Travel Companion," "Timmie," and "Varanara." Lastly, players may consider incorporating cards that facilitate quick swapping, although they may not be as essential due to Kazuha's own kit and the synergy he shares with characters like Venti (as well as the Anemo resonance card) or Keqing, who possess inherent abilities related to swapping.
      Genshin Impact is now available on Mobile, PC, PS4, and PS5. A Switch version is in development.
