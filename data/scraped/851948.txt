Team members are tasked with numerous services like smart contract auditing where they detect and correct existing vulnerabilities in clients’ smart contracts through a series of extensive, in-depth testing.  ShellBoxes deploys a team to assist clients in identifying exploitation on either the smart contract or off-chain code. Additionally, the firm offers blockchain and smart contract development services, offering clients an opportunity to benefit from a genuinely scalable, transparent, reliable, and secure blockchain network and smart contract.  Through a well-grounded and robust audit process, ShellBoxes is working to rekindle the trust of web 3.0 community members in projects they engage with, guaranteeing a safer ecosystem for existing and prospective users. Smart Contract Audit Process ShellBoxes runs a three-layered audit process. In the first stage, the security company requires clients to provide ample information about the context and purpose of the project. This information will help the team better understand the code and business logic.  A thorough inspection for potential vulnerabilities in all aspects of the smart contract ensues. If bugs or attack vectors are found, a remediation plan is provided as well as recommendations for immediate implementation. After that, the team will then initiate a counter-audit as part of its plan to ensure that the remediation process was successful. Clients and Recent Projects ShellBoxes’ recent audit was the Sukiyaki Finance DEX audit which posed several challenges, the prominent being the inability to efficiently balance vital factors such as speed, efficiency, scope, and accuracy. The ShellBoxes team employed both manual and automated testing to detect errors in logic and to broaden the scope of security assessment, respectively. After in-depth testing, the team discovered vulnerabilities that were expeditiously resolved to prevent exploitation.  ShellBoxes also reviewed and subsequently audited Kommunitas’ V3 Staking contract to dispel vulnerabilities that could compromise the project’s security. Additionally, the team reviewed and audited CapFinance, Unicrypt, DefySwap, Star Atlas, and Naos Finance smart contracts. About ShellBoxes ShellBoxes is a leading web 3.0 company with a focus on providing quality blockchain security and development services. The company consists of a group of professionals with both experience and knowledge of the blockchain and DApps security industries.
