It's easy for them to use because it's in a good spot and their customer help is great. You can pay in different ways, like using your bank or credit card. This is nice because people like different ways to pay. When you trade, they don't charge too much, only about 0.075% which is a small part of the money you trade with. This keeps the costs from being too high for people. You can do different types of trading on Bybit.
