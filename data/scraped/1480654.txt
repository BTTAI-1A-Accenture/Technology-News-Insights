 What is Digital MSK? Digital MSK, or digital musculoskeletal (MSK) care, refers to the use of technology and digital tools to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and management of conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system, which includes bones, joints, muscles, and other connective tissues. Digital MSK solutions can include telemedicine consultations, remote monitoring of patient symptoms and progress, digital platforms for self-assessment and self-management, and virtual physical therapy and rehabilitation programs. These solutions aim to make MSK care more convenient, accessible, and cost-effective for patients, while also improving outcomes and reducing the need for in-person visits. Digital MSK has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a rise in remote healthcare services. The use of digital tools for MSK care is particularly relevant given the high prevalence of MSK conditions, which affect millions of people around the world and can have a significant impact on quality of life and healthcare costs. Digital MSK is commonly referred to as digital physical therapy, so what is DPT? Digital physical therapy refers to the use of technology and digital tools to provide physical therapy services remotely, without requiring in-person visits to a physical therapy clinic or office. Digital physical therapy solutions can include telehealth consultations, remote monitoring of patient symptoms and progress, and digital platforms for self-assessment and self-management. Digital physical therapy solutions may use a variety of technologies, such as video conferencing, mobile apps, wearable devices, and virtual reality. These tools enable physical therapists to provide personalized treatment plans and exercises, monitor patient progress, and offer support and guidance to patients remotely. Digital physical therapy has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its convenience, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. It also allows physical therapists to reach a broader patient population and provide more frequent and consistent care. However, it's important to note that digital physical therapy may not be appropriate for all patients or conditions, and in-person physical therapy may still be necessary for some patients. What is driving the Digital MSK market? The digital MSK market worldwide is growing rapidly, driven by factors such as the high prevalence of MSK conditions, the increasing adoption of digital health solutions, and the need for more accessible and cost-effective MSK care. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global digital MSK market size was valued at USD 2.98 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.4% from 2021 to 2028. The market is expected to be driven by a range of digital MSK solutions, including telemedicine, remote monitoring, digital platforms for self-management, and virtual rehabilitation programs. These solutions are being adopted by healthcare providers, employers, and insurers to provide more convenient, efficient, and accessible MSK care to patients. North America is currently the largest market for digital MSK solutions, with a high prevalence of MSK conditions and a strong healthcare IT infrastructure.
