It doesn’t make sense to take a whole water cooler on the go, so for camping and other situations away from home, consider a portable water bottle pump. The Myvision water bottle pump attaches right to the top of a gallon water barrel. As long as the bottle has a 2.16-inch neck (a standard size), it can suit bottles ranging from 1 to 5 gallons. Using this bottle pump is straightforward. Just put it in the top of the gallon bottle, press the top button, and the pump sucks up water and disperses it through its spout. The pump is rechargeable, with a battery life long enough to pump through up to six 5-gallon water jugs. In between camping trips, just recharge the pump with the included USB cable. Get the Myvision water cooler at Amazon. There are several other features to consider when choosing a water cooler. The best water coolers share a few traits: they’re easy to use, easy to clean, and dispense water at the preferred temperature, whether cold or hot. The best coolers should also look nice and be the right size for the intended space. Here are some features to consider when choosing a water cooler. There are two main types of water coolers: point-of-use and bottled coolers. Point-of-use water cooler dispensers connect directly to a building’s water supply and dispense tap water, which is often filtered by the cooler. Bottled water coolers dispense from a large water bottle, which is either top loading or bottom loading. Point-of-use water coolers connect directly to the municipal water supply. They dispense tap water and thus do not require a water bottle, which is why they are sometimes referred to as “bottleless” water coolers. Many point-of-use water coolers have a filtration mechanism to remove substances or improve the taste of water. The main advantage of this type of water cooler is that it has access to a continuous supply of water (barring any issues with the main water line, of course). These coolers can be wall-mounted or freestanding, upright units. A point-of-use water cooler needs access to the building’s main water line. Some also require professional installation, which is an extra cost to consider. Although they may be pricier to buy and install, bottleless water coolers can save money in the long run because they don’t require regular deliveries of bottled water refills. They also tend to be much cheaper than a whole-home water filtration system. A point-of-use water cooler’s convenience is its major selling point: Users get a constant supply of water without lugging and replacing heavy water jugs. Bottom-loading water coolers get their water supply from a water bottle. The water bottle mounts in the bottom half of the cooler in a covered compartment. The bottom-loading design makes unloading and loading bottles much easier. Rather than having to pick up and flip over a heavy bottle (as is the case with top-loading coolers), simply shimmy the water jug into the compartment and connect it to the pump. Since bottom-loading coolers use bottled water, they can dispense other types of water—like mineral, distilled, and spring waters—in addition to tap water. The other nice thing about bottom-loading water coolers is they’re more aesthetically pleasing than top-loading coolers because the plastic refill jug is hidden from view in the lower compartment. For the same reason, consider a bottom-loading water dispenser that has a water-level notifier, which will make it easier to check for when it’s time for a new bottle. Top-loading water coolers are a popular option because they’re so affordable. As their name suggests, water bottles are inserted spout down into the top of the water cooler. Because the cooler’s water comes from a jug, it can also dispense distilled, mineral, and spring water. A top-loading water cooler’s biggest drawback is unloading and loading the water bottle, which can be a cumbersome process for some. Though some people may not like looking at a top-loading water cooler’s exposed jug, the jug’s water level is at least easy to monitor. A countertop water dispenser is a miniature version of a standard water cooler that’s small enough to fit on a countertop. Like standard water coolers, countertop units can be point-of-use models or source their water from bottles. Countertop water coolers are portable and ideal for kitchen counters, break rooms, office waiting rooms, and other locations with limited floor space. However, they can take up a good deal of counter space, which may be an issue in rooms where tabletop real estate is limited. Point-of-use water coolers do not have a capacity limit—as long as water is flowing, these coolers will dispense it. Capacity is a factor to consider with bottled water coolers. Most of these coolers accommodate jugs that hold 2 to 5 gallons of water (3-gallon and 5-gallon bottles are the most common sizes). Consider how often the water cooler will be used when choosing the right capacity. If the cooler will get a lot of use, get one with a larger capacity so it doesn’t run low too quickly. If the cooler will be used less frequently, choose one that accommodates smaller bottles. It’s best to avoid letting water sit for long because stagnant water can be a breeding ground for bacteria. The amount of energy a water dispenser uses depends on the model. Water coolers with on-demand cooling or heating tend to use less energy than those with hot and cold water storage tanks. Coolers with storage usually use more standby energy to maintain the tank’s water temperature. Energy Star-certified water tanks are the most energy-efficient options. On average, an Energy Star-certified water cooler uses 30 percent less energy than one without that designation, which will save energy—and lower the electric bill—over the long term. Some water coolers are equipped with filtering systems, which can remove contaminants and improve the taste of the water. Depending on the filter, they can remove particles and contaminants like dirt, heavy metals, chemicals, bacteria, and more. Coolers can filter water via ion exchange, reverse osmosis, or activated-carbon filters. Don’t forget that these systems’ filters will need to be replaced every so often, which is another expense to factor in when choosing a water cooler. Water filtration is a common feature on point-of-use filters because these coolers dispense municipal tap water. Filtration is less of a concern with bottled water coolers because most water bottles contain filtered water. Most coolers, whether bottled or point-of-use coolers, can dispense cold water. Other units can also provide cool, room-temperature, and/or piping-hot water at the push of a button. Most cooler manufacturers will specify their products’ peak temperatures, and others may have adjustable temperature settings. A water cooler that dispenses both cold and hot water is a wise purchase. Having hot water on demand is handy for those who regularly consume tea, coffee, hot chocolate, and instant foods, or entertain guests or clients who do. When shopping for a cooler with a hot-water spigot, look for a unit equipped with a safety lock that prevents accidental use of the hot-water tap. The amount of noise a water cooler makes is another factor to consider. Water coolers have a water pump to move water around and electrical elements to cool or heat the water, so they will all generate some level of noise. How important noise level is depends on where the cooler will be situated in the home or office. Noise level might be low on the list of concerns if the cooler will be in an office break room or in a home’s garage. In high-traffic living areas or near desks in the workplace, a quieter water cooler is ideal. Water coolers don’t often share a noise level rating, so check shopper reviews to get an idea of its noise level. A good water cooler should be easy to use. Some units have buttons or spigots to activate pouring, while others are touchless. A cooler with enough area below the spout to fill water pitchers and reusable water bottles is especially useful in public spaces like gyms and restaurants. Whether a cooler is easy to install is another important consideration, and one that might involve an extra expense on the owner’s part. Bottled water coolers are typically easier to install than point-of-use units, which usually require professional plumbing. Those shopping for bottled water coolers should bear in mind that bottom-loading units are much easier to load. Water coolers need occasional cleaning to prevent buildup of mineral deposits and to keep germs from thriving. Proper cleaning maintains the quality and taste of the water. Though it takes just a little time, elbow grease and some vinegar or bleach will clean most coolers; however, not everyone will want the bother. In that case, self-cleaning water coolers may be a worthy investment. Water coolers can be simple and straightforward but more often than not, they boast at least a few bells and whistles. One important feature to look for is safety locks. Child-safety locks can prevent little ones from playing with water spouts and wasting water. This is especially important for coolers that dispense hot water: A hot-water safety lock that prevents accidental burns is a good safety feature for both children and adults. Other useful features found on some water-cooler models are night lights, empty-bottle alerts, and leak-detection alarms. For busy homes or offices, water coolers that are self-cleaning may be worth the extra cost. Refrigerated compartments, coffee dispensers, and carbonation options are other convenient features to consider. Whether it’s for daily use or a temporary measure (like providing drinking water when your tap water is cloudy), water coolers are just plain convenient. Once installed, a water cooler is easy to use and requires some simple maintenance like refilling and cleaning. Proper maintenance will keep a water cooler dispensing for years to come. Here are some frequently asked questions about choosing and maintaining a water cooler. Water dispensers come in a range of types and sizes. Choose a water dispenser that is the right size and type (point-of-use or bottled) and has the water-temperature options that suit your needs. Electricity usage will depend on the model. Water dispensers that are Energy Star certified will help cut back on the electric bill. For fresh and clean water, it’s best to replace the water bottle every month or so. Yes, it is important to clean a water cooler according to the manufacturer’s instructions to prevent bacteria, dirt, and mineral buildup. With proper maintenance and cleaning, a water cooler can last upwards of a decade. Contributing Writer Jasmine Harding is a freelance writer specializing in home products.
