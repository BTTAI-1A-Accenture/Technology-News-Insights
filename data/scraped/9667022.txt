USERS of the digital wallet Pitaka can now purchase cryptocurrencies directly with Philippine peso and pay using their debit cards, credit cards, GCash, Maya, GrabPay and ShopeePay within the app. Tetrix, the Filipino-led Web3 company behind the digital wallet, has announced its partnership with Transak as its fiat on-ramp support. Pitaka is a self-custodial digital wallet that allows users to store their crypto assets and interact with NFT marketplaces, play and earn games, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. With Transak's integration, users do not have to switch to another service and go through many intermediate steps to buy crypto.
