Global Commercial HVAC Market - Segmentation Assessment    Segment Overview  Technavio has segmented the market based on application (equipment and services), type (heat pump, furnaces, boilers, and unitary heaters), and geography (APAC, North America, Europe, South America, and Middle East and Africa).   The market growth in the equipment segment will be significant over the forecast period. The growth of the segment is driven by the rise in construction activities, especially in the Middle East and Asian countries. The demand for HVAC equipment is also increasing in Europe and North America, as these regions have extremely low climatic temperatures. Underfloor heating (UFH) systems under the HVAC equipment are becoming popular, as they offer energy savings and occupy minimal space compared with other radiators. In addition, stringent environmental regulations on energy conversation will have a positive impact on segment growth over the forecast period.     Geography Overview  The report provides actionable insights and estimates the contribution of all regions to the growth of the global commercial HVAC market.   APAC will account for 34% of the market growth during the forecast period. The growth of the regional market is primarily driven by increasing spending on commercial infrastructure projects. In addition, the rising number of smart city projects and the proliferation of shopping complexes, entertainment centers, and business parks are contributing to the growth of the commercial HVAC market in APAC.     For insights on global, regional, and country-level parameters with growth opportunities from 2017 to 2027 -download a sample report    Global Commercial HVAC Market  –  Market Dynamics    Key Trends –  The growing adoption of advanced refrigerants in air conditioners is identified as the key trend in the market. Concerns regarding the use of refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), ammonia, and halon have led vendors to adopt newer, advanced refrigerants that have better efficiency and are more environmentally friendly. For instance, some vendors are using R32 refrigerant in air conditioners as a replacement for R410A, R22, and other refrigerants. The R32 refrigerant does not lead to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer. It also has high heat transfer efficiency and helps in lowering the energy consumption of the air conditioner per unit of cooling capacity. The use of such advanced refrigerants will positively influence the market growth over the forecast period.  Major challenges –  Stringent government regulations will challenge the growth of the market. Vendors must comply with various regulations to ensure that commercial HVAC systems release low amounts of carbon and are energy efficient. Also, refrigeration equipment technicians will need to pass a certification exam to sell or purchase refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Any failure to adhere to regulatory standards or the introduction of new regulations compels vendors to replace their already manufactured commercial HVACs. Such challenges will hinder the growth of the market.  market drivers, upcoming trends, and challenges can impact businesses. find more such key insights in the sample pdf report!

  Global Commercial HVAC market – Vendor Analysis  
   Global Commercial HVAC market – Vendor Analysis   The global commercial HVAC market is fragmented due to the presence of numerous local, regional, and international players. Vendors are focused on expanding their customer bases across other geographical locations.

For insights on global, regional, and country-level parameters with growth opportunities from 2017 to 2027 -download a sample report     Global Commercial HVAC Market  –  Market Dynamics     Key Trends –   The growing adoption of advanced refrigerants in air conditioners is identified as the key trend in the market. Concerns regarding the use of refrigerants such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), ammonia, and halon have led vendors to adopt newer, advanced refrigerants that have better efficiency and are more environmentally friendly. For instance, some vendors are using R32 refrigerant in air conditioners as a replacement for R410A, R22, and other refrigerants. The R32 refrigerant does not lead to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer. It also has high heat transfer efficiency and helps in lowering the energy consumption of the air conditioner per unit of cooling capacity. The use of such advanced refrigerants will positively influence the market growth over the forecast period.   Major challenges –   Stringent government regulations will challenge the growth of the market. Vendors must comply with various regulations to ensure that commercial HVAC systems release low amounts of carbon and are energy efficient. Also, refrigeration equipment technicians will need to pass a certification exam to sell or purchase refrigerants, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Any failure to adhere to regulatory standards or the introduction of new regulations compels vendors to replace their already manufactured commercial HVACs. Such challenges will hinder the growth of the market.   market drivers, upcoming trends, and challenges can impact businesses. find more such key insights in the sample pdf report!
