"The conditions, weather-wise, I think it's better here. It was too humid in Ningbo. I think it's an advantage to me.  "I was trying to adapt a little bit to the balls and the courts. I think with good hands, that's a little bit of an advantage that I can have." Jabeur will face Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk in the second round.  More to follow...
