According to its Ministry of Finance, the crypto space is already problematic, and these theft cases are worrisome. Nevertheless, authorities are doing enough to ensure the ecosystem has a good level of tranquillity. The ministry also cited that five culprits of crypto laundering are already under the custody of the Indian crime-fighting agency. The agency further warned WazirX, a local crypto exchange, and its executives about expensive transactions on the platform, especially those over $338 million. Meanwhile, the Indian government has already established some rules to monitor and improve the ongoing activities with digital assets. The ministry cited that digital currency dealings in the South Asian Market will receive support from anti-laundering regulations. This move aims to ensure a secure environment where crypto transactions occur.¬† As such, NFT providers, crypto exchanges, and custody wallet providers are to ensure proper investigations of financial activities. Each of these organizations has a specific role to play in ensuring the effectiveness of the rules. Wallet providers and crypto exchanges are to oversee the use of AML/CFT controls.

On the other hand, companies operating in the digital currency environment are to oversee the KYC process of customers.¬†However, some regions, such as New Delhi, resist these regulations.

It also deducted about 1% for every transaction performed with digital currencies at the time. The tax and the ongoing crypto winter in 2022 during the same period affected many platforms, including CoinDCX, Andreessen Horowitz, and CoinSwitch Kuber.
