They give you a solid grounding in your chosen subject and prepare you to explore the topics that interest you most. Alongside your core modules, you can choose options to broaden your horizons and tailor your course to your interests. This list gives you a flavour of our options, which are
						kept under review and may change, for example in response to student feedback or the latest research. While it’s our aim for students to take their preferred combinations of options, this can’t be guaranteed and will be subject to timetabling.
						Options may be grouped and if so, students will be able to choose a set number of options from the selection available in any particular group. We regularly review our modules to incorporate student feedback, staff expertise, as well as the latest research and teaching methodology. We’re planning to run these
			modules in the academic year 2024/25. However, there may be changes to these modules in response to feedback, staff availability, student demand or updates to
			our curriculum. We’ll make sure to let you know of any material changes to modules at the earliest opportunity. We’ll do our best to provide as much optional choice as we can, but timetabling constraints mean it may not be possible to take some module combinations. The structure
			of a small number of courses means that the order of modules or the streams you choose may determine whether modules are core or optional. This means that your core modules or
			options may differ from what’s shown here. Check back in January 2025 for the modules running in the academic year 2025/26.
