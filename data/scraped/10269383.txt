			Trending:		 Since receiving a life-changing call late last week, Colorado Rapids rookie defender Moïse Bombito said he’s been replaying one song over and over again on YouTube.“Ô Canada! Terre de nos aïeux …”“I’ll be buzzing on Thursday night,” Bombito told The Post on Tuesday.Two years ago Bombito lined up to complete a pair of now-infamous drills as a raw center back at Iowa Western Community College in Council Bluffs: “The Gauntlet” and “Bloody Nose.” On Thursday night, he lined up for an entirely different reason: To sing his national anthem — in French-Canadian, of course — alongside his fellow Canadian national team members for a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal against Panama in Las Vegas.Bombito was raised in Montréal, where he was one of three kids. His mom insisted he play a sport, and he enjoyed kicking the soccer ball around. That was all it took. With different playing styles from around the world showing up on the pitch, the Montréal melting pot provided a strong foundation. Still, he flew under the radar in high school and found his way to the banks of the Missouri River by way of a contact of Iowa Western coach Mike Brown.“Montréal taught me to bring your own spices to the table, don’t just play like everyone else,” he said. “That’s what’s going to make you different. … The coaches saw I was comfortable on the ball, playing in-between the lines (and) being fearless.”The drills implemented by Brown in Iowa taught him something else. Yet only after his time as a Reiver was he able to appreciate exactly what that was.“The Gauntet” was pure, unbridled street ball: 1-vs.-1 up to 11-a-side scrimmages where there were no fouls, shin guards were optional and nobody batted an eye over a ripped pinny. With “Bloody Nose,” coaches lined up 15 players at the mouth of a goal then fired away with shot after shot, forcing players to stop the ball from going in by any means necessary (other than their hands). Both drills proved invaluable as Iowa Western played in two NJCAA national title games and won in 2021.

“It was like, ‘Why are you guys wanting the ball to hit your nose willingly, what are you doing?’ Once you realize that, it’s that hunger, to prove to the coaching staff that you want to play,” he said. “… As soon as you go through that, mentally you just go up a notch and you’re ready to overcome anything.”Bombito left Iowa with the smarts to snuff out danger and courage to lunge fearlessly into a tackle, something Rapids fans already admire. But more importantly, he took Brown’s “Gauntlet Mentality” to heart as he stayed disciplined in the classroom and away from the field.“Yeah, we created an environment, but I’ve had so many kids that were talented and good players but they didn’t take advantage of the resources,” Brown said. “He did. He wasn’t perfect, and I think sometimes people think these kids are. No, he made poor choices, made mistakes. But when given those consequences and some guidance, he took it and allowed it to make himself better. I’m just so proud to see him grow.”Related Articles

Bombito ultimately moved on to the University of New Hampshire, and in his one season of D-I ball, the 6-foot-3 Canadian excelled.
