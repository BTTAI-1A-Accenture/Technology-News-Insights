Kevin Costner legally cannot force his estranged wife, Christine Baumgartner, to leave the home they shared as a family, according to Baumgartner’s lawyer. Attorney John Rydell said Costner’s request for order “seeks to kick Christine and their three children out of the house that the children have lived in for their entire lives,” according to court documents obtained by Insider. “Although the legal basis for Kevin’s request to kick his wife and children out of their home is all but nonexistent, this is still a matter of critical importance for Christine,” Rydell added. Rydell’s statements come after documents showed that the “Yellowstone” star claimed Baumgartner is refusing to leave their house — despite agreeing to their long-standing prenup stating that she had 30 days to vacate after filing for divorce. Baumgartner, 49, filed for divorce from Costner, 68, on May 1, putting her past the 30-day deadline. Documents obtained by TMZ also alleged that the former model isn’t budging as a form of leverage to force Costner to agree to her “various financial demands.” In the court docs uncovered by TMZ, Costner claimed that he is willing to “contribute as part of his child support obligations $30K per month for a rental house and is willing to advance another $10K for her moving costs,” though the actor has allegedly already given his estranged wife more than $1.2 million for his prenuptial obligations. Costner also previously alleged in court documents that Baumgartner charged $95,000 on the actor’s credit card “without prior notice” to lawyers and a forensic accountant. Costner and Baumgartner married in September 2004 and have three kids: Cayden, 16, Hayes, 14, and Grace, 13.
