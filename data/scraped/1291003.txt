GameStop’s latest "Buy 2, Get 1 Free" promotion is offering up great discounts on some of the biggest games and systems on the market. Every so often, GameStop has special offers and giveaways in order to clear its excess inventory, many of which coincide with November’s Black Friday holiday. The most recent of these promotions included pre-owned copies of hit PS4 and Xbox One titles like Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection alongside an assortment of used consoles and accessories.
                         This most recent three-for-two offer comes at a trying time for GameStop, as the once prosperous gaming retail chain has announced mass employee layoffs and even locations being shut down over the past few months. Despite spiking stock prices, GameStop's profits are down overall with a likely culprit being a slowdown in AAA video game releases. However, gamers who wish to build up their libraries or pick up a few accessories for their favorite console will get the chance to save some cash in the next few days.

                     Earlier today, GameStop announced its latest “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” promotion, which includes special discounts on games, consoles, and accessories for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. As the name implies, players will be able to get a free item with every two purchases – however, the free product will be the one that costs the least. Additionally, the deal only applies to pre-owned games and refurbished consoles. Click here to see the GameStop Buy 2 Get 1 free deals.
                         The games available as part of GameStop’s most recent “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” deal include a wide range of hit titles, with blockbuster Nintendo Switch exclusives like Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury and Luigi's Mansion 3 being listed on GameStop’s website at reduced prices alongside the likes of God of War Ragnarok and Hogwarts Legacy. Some of the hardware featured in this promotion include used versions of the PS5 DualSense controller, the PlayStation VR headset, and even the portable Nintendo Switch Lite.
                         It still isn’t clear just how long GameStop's latest “Buy Two, Get 1 Free” offer is going to last, but past deals suggest that it could continue over the next few days or so. Players can take the opportunity to land some older titles, controllers, or even the previously hard-to-get PS5 console while saving some money in the process at GameStop this week – whether at a brick-and-mortar store or by browsing on GameStop’s website.
