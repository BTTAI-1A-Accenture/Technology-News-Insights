Keep your eye to the sky Saturday at noon when we drop hundreds of ping pong balls from the East Idaho News chopper over the Cotant Park baseball fields. Bring your ping ping ball (one per person) to the EastIdahoNews.com booth and exchange it for a prize or treat. If you’re lucky enough to get a ball with a number on it, your prize will be extra special (such as a 75 inch Smart TV, spa package, backpacks and more!).
