 Trending Source: Getty / Getty Kenya Moore and castmate Sheree Whitfield wore the same green cut-out dress, and both women looked stunning. Moore teased the look on her Instagram page, and in true messy fashion, she wants fans to decide who wore it better, and she also wants them to know she wore the look first. “#RHOA tonight at 8pm last day in Spain Portugal (LOL inside joke😝) Btw—- who wore it best? @shereewhitfield or me? Hehehe Well… I wore it first 💋 Healthy hair by @kenyamoorehair sold in @cvspharmacy and @sallybeauty @ak.gobang on the 1 and 2s🥰 I used #growthserum and #mask #mooreedges,” she wrote. The Kenya Moore Haircare guru pulled her long, luscious locs into a high ponytail, and accessorized her look with scrappy sandals and a small clutch purse. She sported the look during a group outing, while Whitfield rocked the glamorous frock during an after show taping. In response to Moore’s question, Whitfield responded, “We both look hot 😍🔥”
