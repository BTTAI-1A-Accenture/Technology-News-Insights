 The Barbie movie may have premiered in cinemas back in July but the movie hype is still going strong. Barbie's influence on fashion and beauty trends is also just as present as it was five months ago, with everyone still desperate to copy Margot Robbie's structured co-ords, Chanel-inspired dresses and voluminous hair. Included in this group is Olivia Attwood. We can't say for sure that the former Love Island has taken inspo from Barbie for her latest look, but her followers are likening her to a doll after seeing the pictures showcasing a new hair and style look. "You lot said main grid, so this is me getting around to it 3 weeks later," the newlywed captions the series of gorgeous BTS snaps. "It's giving News Anchor Barbie," comments one follower, while a second agrees with: "An actual doll, stunning!" "The poofyness of that hair is unreal," a third says. A fourth asks: "Easily one of my fav looks on you! Could we know where this dress is from?!" Olivia hasn't replied to the comment but someone else did, noting "It’s sold out @rowenroseofficial". As the follower helpfully mentions, Olivia's wool-crepe mini dress is from a designer brand named Rowen Rose, which is stocked on Net A Porter. Sadly it is out of stock at the moment, but you can get a similar look for less. We love Wanderdoll's Baby Blue Victoria Dress, now £63.75 here, and Monki Towelling Tennis Dress in bright blue, now £12.50 here. While we do love the structured blue dress Olivia is wearing in the snaps, it's her hair that we spotted first. Somehow she's managed to get a load of volume into a pulled-back, sleek ponytail – and we're going to need her to drop a tutorial ASAP so we can recreate this for ourselves!
