 Using HomeKit smart blinds is the perfect example of how a smart home can make even the most mundane and boring tasks exciting. The best HomeKit smart blinds on the market can be used to automate opening and closing all of the blinds in your house, letting in light and heat (or shutting them out) with just the touch of a button or your voice thanks to Siri. Like every other HomeKit device on the market, you can combine smart blinds with other products to create automation and schedules, so that your blinds close at a certain time of day, or when you switch off all the lights for bed.  Many of the picks on offer today are completely customizable, so will fit any shape and size of window. The biggest question facing HomeKit smart blind buyers is whether to retrofit their existing blinds with an upgrade like the Eve MotionBlinds kit or the Aqara Roller Shade Driver or to start from scratch with integrated smart blinds.

- Requires hub for HomeKit Like IKEA's FYRTUR blinds, the TREDANSEN lineup comes in several pre-sized options that cover most standard window sizes. The blinds are available in either black-out or light-filtering styles and they feature a more traditional cellular blind design than others here. While the blinds look traditional, you still get modern conveniences like rechargeable batteries, physical remotes, and HomeKit support (of course). As with the FYRTUR blinds, you'll need IKEA's TRADFRI Gateway to use HomeKit. Before you buy some smart blinds there are a few things you need to think about, and a couple of things you need to check. You'll need to measure your window, make sure you choose the right kind of blind, and then choose the perfect blind for you and your smart home setup. Here is the lowdown: Measure your window
First things first, double-check the height and the width of your window. When choosing the size blinds that fit, you'll want to make sure that it's ever so slightly bigger than the gap it needs to cover, so that it can go over the window properly and provide a proper seal against the outside world. What kind of Blind?
All of the blinds here are roller blinds, and that will be most of the smart blinds you find on the internet. Of course, if you've got Roman blinds you'll have to find an alternative option to make them smart. You might also have curtains — some of the options above have curtain options, and there are some other great devices for controlling curtains. Battery or wired?
This will depend on how easy it is to access a power outlet near your blinds — if there's one nearby, then a wired option is the way to go, that way you'll never find yourself running out of juice. If a power outlet is further away, then you'll need to go for a rechargeable option. That will make the blind completely wireless, in effect making for a much tidier setup. There is then a module you'll need to use to plug the battery in. Upgrade or integrated?
This is where you choose whether you want to use a preexisting set of blinds or fit a new one. An integrated option is one that has all the smart blind equipment in it already, without any need for any existing blinds. The upgrade will need to be fitted to blinds that you've already got, so you should check compatibility. Smart blinds are among the best HomeKit accessories, adding great convenience to keeping your home private and rooms shaded, with lots of flexibility for automating them alongside other sensors and smart home routines. The best HomeKit blinds give you remote controls through the Home app and Siri. Through the power of automation and scenes, you can incorporate them into your morning or evening routine, as well as for movie night. If you want to add smart features in a simple way, smart blinds are an excellent addition to your home, especially when you want to be hidden away from the outside world for a time. Smart blinds are also perfect if you're new to smart home tech, showing off what can be accomplished through HomeKit. Once you've got all set up with blinds, consider adding on the best HomeKit light bulbs, best HomeKit light strips or best HomeKit motion sensor for even more automations. For instance, you could set the smart blinds to close at the same time as you schedule your smart light bulbs dim for the evening.  Depending on your windows, you may quickly find smart blinds that are the perfect size or you may need to arrange a custom order. Fortunately, most smart blind companies are able to make changes to the size and shades, so they're a perfect fit in your home. Keep in mind that there are great options for retrofitting old blinds with smart roller controls, so that you don't have to ditch the lovely fabric you've already got hanging against your windows. It's a good idea to consider if you want (or need) a cost-effective and pre-sized solution or not. If customization isn't essential, check out IKEA's FYRTUR blackout roller line. The wireless blackout blinds are affordable and come in various standard window sizes. They also work with the TRADFRI Gateway to provide HomeKit support. The FYRTUR Blinds even come with a handy remote that you can stick on the wall or set on a table. For outdoors smarts, you need the SmartWings Motorized Outdoor Patio Shades. The customizable outdoor shades are available in four color options. They also provide support for solar panels and handheld remotes so you have plenty of options here for your long-term smart home plans. iMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.
