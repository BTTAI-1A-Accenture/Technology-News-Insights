With the commitment to be more efficient and  sustainable, the LATAM group advances in the renewal of its fleet, announcing  that it will have 31 A320neo family aircraft in operation by the end of 2023. The additional purchase of Airbus aircraft  will allow the group to have more than 100 A320neo, A321neo and A321XLR  aircraft by the end of this decade. Today, the LATAM group has 16 Airbus  A320neo aircraft in operation and this year it expects to receive another 15  Airbus aircraft, including the first A321neo in its fleet. The first A321XLR  will be delivered in 2025. This will allow the LATAM group to replace its  aircraft with more modern and efficient ones, increase its fleet and continue  with the recovery of its operation compared to pre-pandemic levels.  "The renewal of the fleet that we are  carrying out is fully aligned with our commitment to sustainability and brings  us closer to the goal of becoming a carbon neutral group by 2050. The Airbus  A320neo aircraft has more efficient engines, aerodynamic improvements and  technologies that provide a 20% lower fuel consumption, with a 50% reduction in  nitrogen oxide emissions,” said Sebastián Acuto, Director of Fleet and  Projects, LATAM Airlines Group.  Regarding the Airbus A321neo, it consumes 22%  less fuel per seat than the previous model, the A320ceo. In addition, the  Airbus A321XLR is the single-aisle aircraft (narrow-body) with the longest  flight range in the world (7,400 km) and with up to 38% less fuel consumption  per flight than an aircraft with two aisles (wide body). Most of LATAM's A320 Family aircraft fleet is  equipped with software that reduces annual CO2 emissions by more than 60,000  tons by optimizing the aircraft's landing path. Currently, the LATAM group has 311 aircraft,  57 passengers Boeing (767, 777 and 787 models) and 238 Airbus aircraft (A319,  A320, A320neo and A321 models). In addition, LATAM Cargo Chile, LATAM Cargo  Colombia and LATAM Cargo Brazil have a joint fleet of 16 cargo planes, which  will gradually expand to 20 cargo planes by 2024.
