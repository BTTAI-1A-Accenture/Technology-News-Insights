 COLUMBUS, Ohio â In the do-or-die desperation that comes with the MLS Cup Playoffs, a simple substitution can be enough to tip the tactical balance in favor of one team over the other. The Colorado Rapidsâ ouster of the Columbus Crew on Saturday night proved a case in point.   Down 2-1 in the aggregate goal series with 15 minutes remaining, Rapids manager Gary Smith threw caution to the wind in shifting to a 3-5-2 formation for the first time this year. He replaced two fullbacks with attackers Macoumba Kandji and Claudio Lopez, and brought on defender Julien Baudet to anchor the three-man backline.   Kandji helped set up the Rapids' lone goal on Saturday night, and all three subs scored in the penalty kick shootout.   âWe were trying to get the most aggressive players on the pitch and the most creative players,â Smith said after the match. âIt paid some dividends.â  The payoff came in the form of Conor Caseyâs 84th-minute goal, which tied the aggregate score, sending the series into overtime. 
HIGHLIGHTS: Columbus 2, Colorado 1 (2-3 on agg.) Meanwhile, after owning the first 20 minutes of the match, the Columbus Crew ceded possession to Colorado and began to chase the game toward the end. The Crew managed to score a second goal on a 70th-minute counterattack against the run of play, but they lacked the punch of earlier in the game.  âEven if I didnât score, you can tell the difference with [me and Emmanuel Ekpo] on the field and when we came off the field,â winger Robbie Rogers said. âWe didnât get behind them. We werenât as dangerous.   âI know it sounds real arrogant. But itâs a big difference when Emanu and I are on the field.â   The momentum shift late in the second half belied the fast start by Columbus, and the Crew eventually paid the price for backing off.  âWe kind of took our foot off the gas a little bit and they kept throwing guys forward and unfortunately they were able to get a goal,â midfielder Eddie Gaven said. âThe game was pretty even for the overtime period also. Itâs just a shame that it has to end on PKs.â
