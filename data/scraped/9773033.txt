After being placed on leave and put under investigation by his organization One True King, the streamer went on a hiatus across all platforms.  He was subsequently found not guilty following a third-party investigation and the streamer has since got back to making content — even going viral for dropping a bench press on himself while attempting a new personal best.  After being hit with a ban on January 13 for “aiding account suspension evasion,” Mizkif’s channel returned just a day later.  According to StreamerBans, this is Mizkif’s second ban from the platform. His first was in February 2020 — where he was quickly unbanned shortly after.  In response to StreamerBans, Mizkif shared the email he received from Twitch revealing that his suspension was for “Aiding Account Suspension Evasion.”  pic.twitter.com/jpkltxiXyC Fans have suggested the ban was due to watching a video from disgraced streamer GrossGore — who was banned from Twitch in 2021.  This would be breaking the platform’s terms of service, which prohibits streamers from watching a suspended user’s content on their broadcast. The ban didn’t last long, as Twitch brought his channel back just 24 hours later. Although, Mizkif has yet to return to stream — presumably taking the weekend off.
