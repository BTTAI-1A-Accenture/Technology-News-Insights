 Food and Dining Reporter Louisiana Super Saver is a gas station and food mart on Louisiana Avenue very close to the Uptown Mardi Gras parade route. Restaurants and home kitchens aren't the only places to get a great meal in south Louisiana. In many areas, you can find an excellent plate at gas stations, convenience stores and food marts. Some gas station food fans would even say these meals rival those in Louisiana's best restaurants. "Can we all agree that when gas station fried chicken is good then it just hits different," @audigras said on Instagram. So, NOLA.com asked our readers on Instagram about their favorite convenience store, food mart or gas station to grab a bite. Here are the top 10: "FastStop on Jefferson hwy🔥🔥 I said what I said argue with ya maw," @queskqup.
