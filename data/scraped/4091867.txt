 As a lifelong way-to-the-left liberal, I agree with letter writer Andrew Elliott that “being aware and attentive to social issues” is important, (“Readers respond: Why fight woke?” March 12). My problem with the woke warriors is their self-righteous approach. They are true believers who brook no argument and offer no redemption. Leaders of nonprofits, professors, writers, artists, political figures, you name it, who have blundered and offended someone, somewhere, have been forced to endlessly repent, confessing their sins. Not a few have lost their stature and their positions. Have these arbiters of our morals never stumbled or misjudged? Do they hope to convert others to their cause by their certitude, by their shunning? Their arrogance and lack of compassion is appalling. Enough already!
