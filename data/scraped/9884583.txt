If you need something sweet to start your day, you should check out the best place in Montana. A lot of folks need help to start their day in Montana. Some folks will go for coffee, energy drinks, or a quick snack. Many folks love starting their day with a delicious donut if you are feeling sweet. Donuts come in all sorts of flavors, fillings, and forms. They are affordable and offer a little sugar rush in the morning. One of the best parts of donuts is that they are so affordable that folks usually buy a dozen to feed or share with their fellow employees. We've talked about the best donut shops in Montana, andÂ there are some stellar places to have this tasty snack. So when I came across this list, I was a little surprised. Yelp made a list of the Top 100 Donut Shops in America for 2023, and only one Montana donut stop made the list. The spot that did make the list is a local favorite. Landing at #46 is the Bozeman icon Granny's Gourmet Donuts. It makes sense that Granny's made this competitive list. Granny's is known for their inventive donuts, affordable prices, and high demand. Granny's has been a Bozeman favorite for decades and is cash-only. When I first moved to Bozeman, I thought it was a donut place that college students loved because it was so close to the Montana State campus. Then I learned how Granny's has been a part of the Bozeman community for decades, and everyone from kids to adults will take time out of their morning to try and get their hands on these incredible donuts. Granny's creates specialty donuts available for a limited time, and these delicious treats make this donut shop even more special. So what are you waiting for? Just remember to get me one with chocolate sprinkles, please. For more details, check out the list on Yelp.
