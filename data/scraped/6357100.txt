    Protect your computer and data from virus attacks, malware and more. Here are our picks for the best antivirus software.
   CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. 
      What to consider
     
      Effectiveness
     Antivirus software runs virus scans for known viruses and malware, watches for shady websites, offers ransomware protection and monitors unexpected behavior that may be a sign of new viruses and malware. You want antivirus software that can successfully identify these unknown online threats without flagging too many false positives.  
      Light on system resources
     You don't want antivirus software that taxes your PC's resources. If after you install the program, websites open slowly, apps download or open sluggishly or file copies take longer than expected, you may want to try another service. 
      Cost and discounts
     Before you buy, check for discounts on a company's website. Another way to save: The prices we list above are for 10 devices -- if the company offered that package -- but you can trim your cost with antivirus packages if you need to cover three or five devices.  
      Privacy
     Companies say they anonymize this technical data as much as possible to protect your privacy. The security companies on our list post privacy policies on their websites, so read their privacy statements to learn what the companies do with the information you share.  
      Protection for other platforms
     Microsoft is by far the biggest target for viruses and malware. Android is second, with just under 1% of apps installed on Android devices with Google Play Protect in the potentially harmful app category.

Keep your computer and important data safe with an extra layer of protection. In an era where your data is always susceptible to getting hacked, having good antivirus software is a must. The best antivirus software does it all: identity protection, malware protection and virus protection. They allow you to keep your computer running smoothly, and theyb keep your private data safe. Good antivirus solutions even help keep scammers at bay. Using one means your computer will likely have a longer life and you'll be better protected. Windows is the most popular operating system for computers today, running on over 70% of all laptops and desktops, according to the latest data from Statcounter. That unfortunately also makes Windows the biggest target for a large number of viruses and malware attacks. As such, all our antivirus software recommendations work on Windows. Currently, CNET's top pick for the best antivirus software is Microsoft Defender, the tech giant's free antivirus solution built into Windows 10 and Windows 11 machines. At CNET, we've spent years testing and researching dozens of online security and privacy tools like VPNs, password managers and antivirus software to help readers find the best solutions for their needs. Take a look through our recommended antivirus services below to see which one fits you best. Note: Pricing for antivirus services can be complicated since providers frequently offer low introductory prices to entice you to sign up for their services. After the first billing period -- typically a year or two, depending on the plan you purchase -- the amount you pay for the service may increase substantially (sometimes double the introductory rate). Be sure to check the terms of the subscription plan before you buy, so you won't get an unwelcome surprise when your subscription renews.  If you practice safe computing -- you keep your software up to date, you use strong passwords (with the help of a password manager), you steer clear of unsolicited emails and you don't click suspicious links that may be phishing attempts -- you probably can avoid zero-day attacks and ransomware attacks. With the free Microsoft Defender Antivirus software running on your Windows PC, you have a malware protection safety net if you do let your guard down. It is one of the best antivirus software options, and the best free antivirus software out there. (Note: Microsoft changed the name of Windows Defender to Microsoft Defender and has expanded the service to other platforms.) This free antivirus program is built into Windows, and it's turned on by default, the antivirus engine does its thing, and this antivirus solution will cover the basics of internet security. Microsoft pushes new updates frequently. Defender also lets you tune the level of protection you want, giving you control over blocking potentially unwanted apps and protecting folders and files from a ransomware attack.  Windows 10 and 11 will automatically disable its own Windows Defender antivirus when you install third-party antivirus. If you uninstall the third-party protection, Windows will turn on its own antivirus again. System Mechanic Ultimate Defense offers elite PC performance, protection and privacy. This one tool delivers increased speed and resources, virus and malware defense, real-time online privacy protection and more. Real-time protection keeps your PC clear of virus and malware threats without sacrificing performance. That’s because System Mechanic Ultimate Defense ensures peak PC performance by making system recommendations that help boost speed and optimize resources. Its online protection suite ensures you stay safe online with configurable privacy settings that let you choose which companies can collect your personal data. You can also enjoy peace of mind wherever you browse with all your passwords in one, easy-to-manage browser extension. Norton LifeLock has consistently earned high marks from AV-Test, AV-Comparatives and SE Labs for virus and malware detection. Norton antivirus provides excellent security software for PC, Mac and mobile devices. The company's products include Antivirus Plus, Norton Secure VPN, Norton 360 for Gamers, Norton 360 with LifeLock Select and more. A 10-device subscription for Norton 360 with LifeLock Select is normally $180 per year, but you can get your first year for $80 off. In addition to malware and virus protection for your computer and mobile device, this security suite provides 100GB of backup to the cloud, safe-browsing tools, a secure VPN, a password manager, parental controls and LifeLock identity theft protection and fraud alert. While not all of those services are necessarily best in their respective class, getting them all in one package is a compelling option. Topping it off, Norton offers a free seven-day test drive of the suite, as well as a full refund "within 60 days of purchase for annual subscriptions and within 14 days of purchase for monthly subscriptions," according to Norton's site. If you'd like to take a step up in securing your PC without taxing your wallet, it's hard to beat Bitdefender's free antivirus software for Windows 10 and 11. The Windows security software offers real-time monitoring for viruses, malware, spyware and ransomware protection. Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is easy to set up and stays out of your way until you need it. And the protection this antivirus product offers is solid. Bitdefender antivirus software consistently earns top marks for its antivirus protection and usability from respected independent antivirus testing labs like the AV-Test lab. The free antivirus version covers one Windows PC. For broader protection, you can choose Bitdefender Total Security or Bitdefender Antivirus Plus. The subscription antivirus suite lets you protect five or 10 devices (Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android), set up parental controls on a kid's computer and run a VPN. Malwarebytes protects your PC from viruses or malware attacks, scoring reasonably well in recent independent testing for guarding against malware threats. That's not really what Malwarebytes is known for. If you find yourself in trouble, the go-to disinfectant for many is Malwarebytes. You can get protection and disinfection for one device for $38 a year (regularly $45). To cover five devices -- any combination of Windows, MacOS and Android -- it's $100 for a year of antivirus software. To get the antivirus company's free antivirus version, download this trial version, which "downgrades" to a no-fee on-demand cleaner with fewer features that detects and removes viruses and malware when you run an on-demand antivirus scan after 14 days. In addition to the four antivirus apps we recommend above, a handful of other anti-malware tools are worth considering among the best antivirus protection if you find them at a better price or just prefer to use one over our picks above.  It feels like McAfee Antivirus has been around forever, first on its own in the '80s, then as part of Intel starting in 2010, and then again on its own when Intel spun it off in 2017. And McAfee Total Protection has been around forever because quarter after quarter it creates solid, modern antivirus software that protects your PC. (In recent evaluations by AV-Test, it had high scores on both protection and performance.) McAfee Total Protection guards devices against viruses and offers ransomware protection, wards off malicious websites and includes a password manager for $50 for the first year. If you agree to auto-renew your antivirus suite subscription, you get access to McAfee ID Theft Protection Essentials, which monitors for ID fraud. Maybe this antivirus provider isn't as well known to consumers because of its focus on enterprise security, but Trend Micro antivirus security quietly brings its business expertise to the home with its Trend Micro Maximum Security tools. Trend Micro's software earns high marks from AV-Test -- consistently scoring well for detecting zero-day attacks and widespread viruses and malware. Trend Micro also does a good job of not taxing system resources.  If you're looking for something easy to set up and use, ESET NOD32 antivirus may meet your needs. It earns high scores for usability and offers solid virus protection. A five-device option is $70 for a year, with a 30-day free trial. The free antivirus version of Sophos Home gives you virus protection for 10 Windows PCs or MacOS devices and unlimited Android and iOS devices -- using the company's high-scoring anti-malware tool -- plus a 30-day trial of the company's malware removal tool. Annual subscriptions typically cost $60, but right now you can sign up for less. We're here to help you find the antivirus software that best fits your needs. These picks of the best antivirus programs are a combination of recommendations from independent third-party labs AV-Test, AV-Comparatives and SE Labs, as well as CNET's anecdotal hands-on testing.  Note that antivirus software is only one piece of the cybersecurity puzzle. Cybercriminals are becoming more sophisticated, and the more steps you take to lock down your online security, the safer you'll be. A secure virtual private network can help protect your internet privacy, and a password manager can help protect your personal information.  In test after test, Avast Antivirus for Windows performed well for malware detection, with options ranging from Avast free antivirus software to Avast Premium Security. We've included its antivirus in our list of recommended security app options before.  However, early in 2024, the Federal Trade Commission fined Avast $16.5 million to settle charges that from 2014 to 2020 the company had sold customer browsing information to more than 100 third parties. Avast allegedly collected the data through browser extensions and antivirus software and sold the data through its Jumpshot subsidiary, the FTC claims. As part of the settlement, Avast is prohibited from selling or licensing any web browsing data for advertising purposes. In response to the initial reports in 2020, then-Avast CEO Ondřej Vlček said in a statement that he understood that his company's actions raised questions of trust in his company. To address that, Avast terminated Jumpshot data collection in January 2020 and closed its operations.  We hope the FTC actions mean that there will be no further Jumpshot-style activities and that Avast returns to glory as one of the best antivirus software options. Until then, we recommend using one of the many other solid choices in this realm (listed above).  Let's talk about Kaspersky Lab, specifically about the 2024 federal ban, announced on June 20, prohibiting Kaspersky from directly or indirectly selling antivirus or cybersecurity software or services in the US or to US citizens. This sweeping ban follows a more limited one in 2017 that prohibited Kaspersky software and services on federal government computers because of alleged ties between Kaspersky and the Russian government. Based in Moscow, Kaspersky Lab has for years produced some of the highest-rated antivirus software for business antivirus needs and home customers. Its software consistently earned top scores and awards for virus and malware detection and endpoint protection from independent testing labs. “Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive US information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard US national security and the American people," Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in the official announcement of the ban. In a statement, Kaspersky said it "does not engage in activities which threaten US national security and, in fact, has made significant contributions with its reporting and protection from a variety of threat actors that targeted US interests and allies." The Commerce Department recommends those who use Kaspersky software switch to replacement software from other security companies as soon as possible. To aid Kaspersky customers with the transition, Kaspersky will be allowed to provide antivirus updates to its software till Sept. 29, 2024, the department said. Picking the best antivirus software for Windows means finding one that keeps your PC safe, doesn't take up a lot of system resources, is easy to use and stays out of the way till you need it. Here's what to look for.  Effectiveness: Antivirus software runs virus scans for known viruses and malware and can offer real-time protection. It watches for shady websites and suspicious links to keep you out of trouble. It can also offer ransomware protection and monitor unexpected behavior that may be a sign of new and not-yet-identified viruses and malware. You want antivirus software that can successfully identify these unknown online threats without flagging too many false positives.  Light on system resources: You don't want antivirus software that taxes your PC's resources. If after you install the program, websites open slowly, apps download or open sluggishly or file copies take longer than expected, you may want to try another service. The good news is that all our picks offer a free trial or money-back guarantee to let you try out the antivirus program, so if your system feels sluggish after installation, you may want to keep looking.  Cost and discounts: Don't just pay the sticker price for antivirus protection. Before you buy, check for discounts on a company's website. Another way to save: The prices we list above are for 10 devices -- if the company offered that package -- but you can trim your cost with antivirus packages if you need to cover three or five devices. You may also find discounts on an app's Amazon page.  Privacy: To be effective, antivirus software needs to monitor what's going on with your PC, check in with company servers about unusual behavior and provide sound banking protection. The companies say they anonymize this technical data as much as possible to protect your privacy. If you want to know more, the security companies on our list post privacy policies on their websites, so read their privacy statements to learn what the companies do with the information you share.  Protection for other platforms: Microsoft is by far the biggest target for viruses and malware. Android is second, with just under 1% of apps installed on Android devices with Google Play Protect in the potentially harmful app, or PHA, category.  The threat to MacOS and especially iOS is low, in part because of the tight control Apple has over its app stores. While the Mac does come under attack via side-loaded apps, it's rare, and if you download apps only from the Mac and iOS app stores and keep your guard up when clicking links and downloading files, you should be OK without an antivirus app on Apple devices.  To a degree, yes. Some antivirus programs can do things like warn you or block you from visiting a suspected phishing site. Others may also automatically block suspicious emails that appear to come from a malicious sender or contain phrasing common in phishing emails. You cannot count on an antivirus program to be a failsafe solution for phishing protection. You still need to be vigilant and know what to look out for on your own when it comes to phishing because an antivirus program won't be able to catch everything. Any program running on your computer will require a certain amount of processing power to work, which can affect your computer's overall performance. If an antivirus program is just running in the background, it shouldn't have any effect on your computer's performance. When actively running a scan of your system, antivirus software can noticeably slow down your computer. If this is the case, try to schedule antivirus scans at night, or at a time when you're not using your computer. There is a common misconception that Macs are inherently immune to malware. As Macs continue to increase in popularity, they're increasingly attractive targets for cybercriminals looking to deploy malware designed for the MacOS operating system. MacOS has a built-in antivirus solution called XProtect that can detect and remove malware. It works in the background and updates automatically to keep up with the latest threats, but it still may not catch everything that a third-party antivirus program will. So if you want to play it safe and boost the malware protection on your Mac, it's a good idea to add a third-party antivirus solution.
