Let’s analyze BetMGM Sportsbook’s lines around the Giants vs. Cubs odds and make our expert MLB picks and predictions for the best bets. Season series: Cubs lead 2-1 The Giants enter this one on a 3-game skid after losing 3 of 4 at the San Diego Padres from Thursday to Sunday. San Francisco is just 8-12 and 12-18 over the last 20 and 30 games, respectively, and is in a 4-way tie for the final NL Wild Card spot. The Cubs are securely in the 2nd NL Wild Card spot, 3 games up on those 4 teams tied for the final spot. They have gone 6-4, 12-8 and 19-11 over the last 10, 20 and 30 games, respectively. It has been a banner year for the Cubbies thus far, and they have arguably their best starter going Monday. RHP Logan Webb vs. LHP Justin Steele Webb (9-11, 3.49 ERA) makes his 29th start. He has a 1.10 WHIP, 1.3 BB/9 and 8.4 K/9 in 180 1/3 innings. Steele (15-3, 2.69 ERA) makes his 26th start. He has a 1.17 WHIP, 1.9 BB/9 and 8.8 K/9 in 144 innings.

Cubs 6, Giants 4 Steele hasn’t lost in his last 8 starts and is 11-2 with a 2.46 ERA at home this season. There is a lot to like on the Cubs’ side. The Giants have scored 3 runs or fewer in 6 of 10 games. After scoring 7 against the Padres Thursday, they plated just 4 runs the next 3 games. Steele and the CUBS (-140) roll. The Cubs are just 34-34 on the RL at home, and it’s too volatile to lean either way in this one. PASS. The wind will be a factor as it is blowing out to left-center at 11 mph. There are a lot of Under trends to use caution with, though. The Giants are 4-6 O/U over the last 10, and Chicago is 3-7 O/U during the same stretch. The Over is just 2-8 in the last 10 meetings. The wind blowing out at Wrigley changes things, though. LEAN OVER 9 (-105). For more sports betting picks and tips, check out SportsbookWire.com and BetFTW. Follow Ryan Dodson on Twitter.
