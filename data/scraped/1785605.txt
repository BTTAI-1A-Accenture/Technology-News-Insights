Just after the Denver Nuggets secured their 94-89 victory against the Miami Heat in Game 5 to win the NBA Finals, the locker-room party started with champagne showers but the fun didn’t end there. In a clip that went viral on social media, footage shows Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray taking a celebratory leap into the arena pool together.  Jokic is seen trying to jokingly force a reluctant Murray, who was holding a champagne bottle in one hand, into the pool before both players eventually fell in, as photographers captured the scene. A championship swim! 😂🏆Jokic throws Murray in to the pool! pic.twitter.com/plu43RzE2v Joining in on the fun was Nuggets forward Vlatko Čančar, yelling out “cannonball!” before making a his big jump into the pool.  Jokic and Murray proved they were one of the best duos in the league once again after combining to finish with 42 points, 24 rebounds and 12 assists. Jokic finished with a game-high 28 points to go along with 16 rebounds in Game 5’s win, while Murray chipped in with 14 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists. The two have long awaited to finally bring home an NBA championship to Denver since the two first played together during the Nuggets’ 2016-17 season.  The team came close in 2020, making the conference finals before losing to the Lakers. Murray tore his ACL late in the 2021 season and missed the entire 2021-22 season.  Now, the title dream come true has been granted for both of the Nuggets’ superstars after their Finals victory.  Advertisement
