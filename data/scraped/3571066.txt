 Help desk software is a tool that businesses use to manage customer inquiries and support tickets. It aids companies in tracking customer problems, apportioning jobs to team members and ensuring customer inquiries are replied to promptly and competently. Help desk software typically includes features such as ticket management, knowledge base management and reporting and analytics. Businesses of all sizes, from small startups to large corporations, use help desk software. Companies of all sizes can use it to make customer support processes more efficient and boost customer satisfaction. “Service desk” and “help desk” are often thought of as the same thing, although there are some key differences between them. A help desk typically provides support for incident management or break-fix issues, while a service desk goes beyond that to assist with service requests, information requests and other IT service management (ITSM) activities. A service desk is more customer-focused, prioritizing delivering high-quality service to customers quickly. ITSM is the broader concept that encompasses all the processes and activities involved in delivering IT services to customers. ITSM teams manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services, including designing, creating, delivering and supporting IT services. ITSM generally includes several core processes, such as service request management, knowledge management, IT asset management, incident management, problem management and change management. Help desk software can provide numerous benefits for businesses and organizations, including: There are many factors to consider when obtaining help desk software for your business. The biggest component to consider is the features you need, though that’s not the only thing. Other considerations include integrations, scalability and customization options. Integrations are an essential component of any help desk software system. By integrating with other software systems, such as CRMs, analytics tools and collaboration software, you can provide your support reps with valuable data to create a more robust customer conversation. This information can flow both ways, with data from the help desk system informing other operations such as sales and marketing. Look for a help desk system that offers prebuilt integration modules or supports REST APIs to build custom integrations. Customization and scalability are critical considerations when selecting help desk software. Customizing your help desk software to fit the requirements of your organization can help save time and improve productivity. Scalability is equally important as it allows the software to grow with your business needs. The right help desk software should allow you to easily add users, manage workflows and incorporate new features to support your expanding operations. When evaluating help desk software, there are several questions your team needs to ask itself. These include: The cost you can expect to pay for help desk software depends on a variety of factors, including: On average, the cost of help desk software can range from around $20 to $200 per user per month, with some enterprise-level solutions costing much more. However, it is important to note that pricing can vary widely depending on the specific software package and vendor, as well as any customization, integration or support needs.

This allows us to objectively compare and contrast each solution against its competitors. Our ratings are not influenced by any third-party relationships. We assign weighted scores to each factor to come up with an overall star rating for each product. When we rate help desk solutions on our website, we take into account the following factors. For pricing, we considered several factors, such as how much the software costs, is it a good value for the price and were there any hidden costs or fees. If a provider offered a free trial or a free version of its software, we gave bonus points for that. We also looked at how inexpensive a provider’s lowest-price plan compared to its highest-priced plan and how much benefit a user received by upgrading to a higher plan. This accounted for 10% of our weighted scoring. We wanted to know what kinds of features the software offers and if it had all of the features that users need. We broke features down into two categories: general features and additional features. For general features, these were features that we expected every software provider to offer, either as part of its regular plan or at least as a paid add-on. These included offering mobile apps―bonus points for offering software for both iOS and Android―plus self-service capabilities, asset management, social media connectivity, access to a knowledge base and community forum for assistance and the ability to work remotely. For additional, or “nice-to-have” features, we focused on customer support. We were looking for chatbots or live chat options, support widgets, self-service ticketing and reporting dashboards. We wanted to see how responsive each provider’s customer support was and if it was available by phone, email or live chat. We weighted features at 50% of our total score. Looking at third-party customer reviews on websites that included Capterra, G2 and Trustpilot, we looked at customer responses to using the software. We gave higher ratings to providers that had at least 300 or more reviews on these websites and then again to those providers that had positive reviews of at least 3.5 out of 5 on each site.to give a complete picture of reality and reduce bias. These accounted for 10% of the total score. Factors that included ease of use made up the final aspect of our analysis by our panel of experts. When looking at ease of use, they wanted to know how easy it is to set up and use the software, if the interface was intuitive and if the software required any training to get started using it. Besides ease of use, other factors our experts considered were the overall popularity of the software, any stand-out features and the value for the money each provided. Altogether, these criteria make up 30% of the total score. If you have more than one person working on customer support, then help desk software can be a valuable asset. It will help you keep track of customer inquiries and make it easier to assign and manage tasks. Zoho Desk, Freshdesk and Jira Service Management are our top three picks for best help desk ticketing software. If you’re looking for tons of integrations, Freshdesk is a great choice. Jira Service Management is best for enterprise businesses, and Zoho Desk is an all-around great selection for a variety of businesses. There are several options available for free help desk software. However, we recommend Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk. CRM software helps businesses manage and analyze their interactions with customers and prospects while help desk software primarily focuses on managing and resolving customer support tickets and inquiries. Help desk software can automate various actions, including ticket assignment, routing and escalation as well as sending automated replies, reminders and follow-up messages to customers. Help desk software can be scalable depending on the specific software and pricing plan chosen. Some providers offer flexible pricing options based on the number of agents or the size of the organization, allowing businesses to scale up or down as needed. Help desk software costs can vary depending on the features and number of agents you need. Some solutions have free plans while others can cost up to $100 per agent, per month. Common features of help desk software include ticketing, knowledge base management, live chat and reporting. Some solutions also offer features, such as asset management and project management.
