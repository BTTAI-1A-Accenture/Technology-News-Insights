There are no current evacuation orders or alerts associated with this incident. The Horsethief Creek blaze was first discovered at about 2:15 p.m. Monday and grew to about 300 hectares by 8 p.m. (MST). BC Wildfire is reporting that the location is within the Bruce Mountain region, and originated approximately 7 km north of Panorama Mountain Resort and 10 km west of Invermere. Due to smoke and challenging flying conditions, an accurate size of this incident was not able to be obtained. The size will be updated when visibility allows as BC Wildfire expects this blaze to increase. “This fire is suspected to be lightning-caused. Aggressive fire behaviour is being driven by a cold front causing southwest winds that are gusting in the 45 km/hr range,” stated BC Wildfire. As this is a new an emerging blaze a response officer is flying in the area. This officer will plan a suppression strategy and tactics that are the most effective, said BC Wildfire. The Horsethief Creek wildfire is continuing to spread and is not responding to suppression efforts. This blaze is now the third fire of note in the Southeast Fire District.
