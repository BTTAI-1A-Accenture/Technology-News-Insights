Sohra Peak Partnership made the following comment about American Coastal Insurance Corporation (NASDAQ:ACIC) in its Q2 2023 investor letter: “Earlier this month, we released an investment memorandum on one of our portfolio holdings American Coastal Insurance Corporation (NASDAQ:ACIC) which can be found here. Since we wrote this memo, American Coastal has released its Q2 2023 quarterly results, which we found to be quite positive and which has led to an increase in our net income estimates for FY23 through FY25. During the quarter, American Coastal’s average premium price per new policy written was significantly higher than I had expected, even in spite of the hard market environment. Based on my estimates, this could result in gross written premium (GWP) for the 12-months ending 6/1/2024 of $750MM or greater, and even possibly closer to $800MM, versus the expectations that I had laid out in the memo of $700MM. Furthermore, based on the company’s continued expected premium price increases, GWP should increase yet again for the 12 months ending 6/1/2025, which may also end up higher than my previous estimate. We continue to view American Coastal as an unusually compelling investment today, and believe that shares could appreciate by +100-200% from today’s prices over the next 2-3 years.” Pixabay/Public Domain American Coastal Insurance Corporation (NASDAQ:ACIC) is not on our list of 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.
