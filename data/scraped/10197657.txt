NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Pokémon cards have been featured on the latest episode of Antiques Roadshow in the US, leaving us wishing we hadn’t thrown our collection away. Viewers of the show – which airs on PBS in the States – were left gobsmacked when they heard how much the trading cards can rack up at auction almost 30 years after they first appeared on shelves. The collector shared how her mum paid just $35 (£27.69) for the complete set of cards in the late 1990s after she thought her daughter was ‘being taken advantage of’ when trading the popular cards with her friends in her childhood. Expert Travis Landry explained that the collection that had been brought to auction was the full set of 102 cards first released in the United States in 1999. He told the collector: ‘You did take really good care of them, they do have some light wear so in the world of trading I’d say they’re in the 8.0, 8.5 [range], you might have a nine in there.’ Giving his expertise on how much he thinks the collector could fetch for the cards, Travis said: ‘The shadowless Metwo, easily in its current shape ungraded is a $800-$1200 (£632-£949) card.’ He continued: ‘We look at your Charizard, not only is it Charizard, it’s also a shadowless Charizard. That card alone in its current condition is going to be in the $2000-$3000 (£1582-£2373) range.’ Yep, for one card. There was some slight bad news, however, when Travis continued: ‘The Pokémon market is extremely volatile. It is a market that blossomed through the pandemic. ‘I hate giving you the womp-womp news on the backside but your Charizard in this shape less than a year ago was easily a $5000-$8000 (£3956-£6329) card. ‘At the peak of the market, in November 2020 to March, April 2021, we were seeing this card hit as high as $15000 (£11868).’ Running through the rest of the collector’s cards, Travis said: ‘Your Nidoking is shadowless, your Gyarados is shadowless, plus the other mix, you have some great jungle holograms, you have a lot of fossil cards in there. ‘There’s approximately 150 cards in your binder. Conservatively at auction, we would say that your binder would be in the $5000-$10000 (£3956-£7912) range.’ The collector couldn’t hold back her excitement as she said: ‘Wow, much more than I was expecting.’ She added: ‘My friends told me $50 (£39.56) for the whole binder.’ Pokémon star Rachael Lillis dies aged 55 Games Inbox: Is the Nintendo GameCube underrated?

Still punching myself.’ A second asked: ‘I have a collection much like this. Where can I sell it?’ Got a story?
