Paperback. Condition: New. Print on Demand. This book presents a comprehensive catalog of known silver, electrum, and bronze coins from the ancient Italian region of Campania, most notably the cities of Neapolis and Nola. Drawing upon a wide range of numismatic sources, the author meticulously describes and categorizes these coins, providing detailed information on their designs, inscriptions, weights, and variations. The catalog is organized into several sections, beginning with the earliest known coins from the 5th century BC, and progressing through various periods, including the Roman conquest in the 3rd century BC. The author discusses the historical context of the coins, their role in trade and daily life, and the artistic influences that shaped their designs. The catalog is illustrated with numerous high-quality images, allowing readers to appreciate the skill and artistry of ancient coin makers. This book offers a valuable resource for collectors, historians, and anyone interested in the monetary systems and artistic traditions of ancient Campania.
