The Kemper Foundation has opened its Read Conmigo bilingual educator grant program applications for the fall 2023 grant cycle. Eligible teachers can apply for grants in the following counties: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura (California); Broward and Miami-Dade (Florida); and Dallas (Texas).

 
The Read Conmigo program underscores The Kemper Foundation's commitment to advance bilingual education through the support of elementary schoolteachers. The Foundation annually awards up to 100 grants of $3,000 each in two grant cycles to teachers of Spanish-English bilingual classrooms. The grants can be used for educational resources, tools and materials, and professional development.

 
"We're pleased to continue supporting the advancement of bilingual literacy in communities across the country," said Barbara Ciesemier, president of The Kemper Foundation. "Our first two grant cycles demonstrated the value this program is bringing to Hispanic and Latino students, classrooms and their families while helping them realize the distinct educational, social and financial benefits of bilingualism."

 
The application deadline for fall 2023 grants is June 25, 2023, at 11:59 p.m. local time. Additional information, including eligibility requirements, grant usage guidelines, FAQs and the grant application, is posted on The Kemper Foundation website. Applications will be reviewed by a selection committee comprised of officers from The Kemper Foundation and Read Conmigo program partners. Grant funds will be awarded at the beginning of the 2023/2024 school year for this grant cycle.
