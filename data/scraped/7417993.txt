 Shopping for a Partner Portal As an extension of your sales force, partners need access to all the sales and marketing resources your direct team needs. Which means you need a secure partner portal to share collateral, demos, pricelists, competitive information, etc. The good news is that there are portal vendors in the market today that offer a wide range of functionality and pricing options, so you can choose what works best for your program and budget. Budget is going to be a big factor in what you can ultimately choose --- and that may sound a little silly – common sense says I can only afford what I can afford, right? But that’s not really what I mean. Portal software can have a wide range of functionality, including really cool marketing functionality, gaming, learning management systems, partner attainment tracking, deal reg and management, storefronts, onboarding, collaboration tools… What I mean is that you have to figure out what’s important to you and focus on vendors within your budget that provide that key functionality. But you also have to have your eye on growth – what are you going to want down the road and will they be able to provide it? Marketing functionality is one of the things you really have to dive into and figure out what you want/need. There are enterprise vendors who can give your marketing team everything they ever dreamed of. Do you need it? Do you have the marketing team to support it? Because having the tools is cool, but you need the team to create the content, campaigns, and communications that will make your partners successful; otherwise, there's no point in paying for the tools. Another important thing to look at is integration with your existing CRM and marketing tools.  Before you start shopping, be sure you have a prioritized list of what you’re hoping for. Collaborate with all your internal teams to gather their requirements (and concerns): When you speak with different portal vendors, ask them what best practices they’ve seen with their customers, especially in areas that you’re just developing – maybe around deal reg or training delivery, for example. I’ve gotten lots of good ideas from asking this question. Last piece of advice --- when you have your finalists, ask their references what they would have done differently during implementation but also ask what functionality they’ve requested from the vendor, and reach out to your contacts on LinkedIn to see who else has used the software and what feedback you can gather from their experience. Knowing what didn’t work for someone else can help you build your processes differently from day one, saving you time and helping you build more successful solutions in your portal. Don’t want to lead the selection process on your own? There are consulting companies who specialize in portal selection and implementation who can help. I’ve used AchieveUnite in the past and loved working with them. I hope this has been helpful. Contact me on LinkedIn if you want to learn more – there are so many facets to selecting the right portal for your business, I can’t possibly cover all the topics here. I’m happy to chat one-on-one about portal vendors I’ve used in the past.
