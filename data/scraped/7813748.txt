Contact us for Special Discount and Pricing Challenges in the EVSE Market One of the challenges facing the EVSE market is the lack of standardization. Different manufacturers use different charging connectors, making it difficult for EV owners to find a charging station that's compatible with their vehicle. This lack of standardization is also making it difficult for charging station operators to install and maintain their infrastructure. Another challenge is the limited availability of charging stations in some areas. This is particularly a problem in rural areas and smaller towns, where the infrastructure necessary to support EVs is lacking. This limited availability of charging infrastructure can be a barrier to the adoption of electric vehicles in these areas.
