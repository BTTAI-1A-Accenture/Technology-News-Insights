We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the significant cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. The $11.4 million of tax is comprised of $15.5 million of tax expense net of $4.1 million of a cash income tax benefit. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $57.3 million ($46.9 million, net of tax). The $10.4 million of tax is comprised of $14.5 million of tax expense net of $4.1 million of a cash income tax benefit. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (2)   During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident of $0.4 million ($0.3 million, net of tax). During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident of $0.6 million ($0.5 million, net of tax). See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (3)   During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded an unrealized gain on the fair market value adjustment of $3.1 million ($2.1 million, net of tax). During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded an unrealized gain on the fair market value adjustment of equity investments of $8.3 million ($2.9 million, net of tax). The fair value adjustments were recorded to the Other income, net line item within the Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional details.   (4)   During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a foreign currency gain on certain intercompany loans of $0.1 million. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a foreign currency loss on certain intercompany loans of $0.8 million. The impact was recorded to the Other income, net line item within the Consolidated Statements of Income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (5)   During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded $24.7 million ($18.6 million, net of tax) for acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded $11.8 million ($7.9 million, net of tax) for acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization. These costs primarily related to integration costs resulting from recent acquisitions and were recorded in operating income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (6)   During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.7 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.1 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation expense in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (7)   Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers in 2018. During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.1 million related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (8)   During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a tax expense of $3.9 million related to adjustments to deferred tax balances resulting from changes in state tax law. See Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (9)   During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded the tax impact of adjustments of $16.6 million comprised of (i) acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $11.4 million ($15.5 million of tax expense net of $4.1 million of cash income tax benefit), (ii) a tax adjustment of $0.1 million related to legal expenses for the 2017 cybersecurity incident, (iii) a tax adjustment of $1.0 million related to the fair market value adjustment of equity investments and (iv) a tax adjustment of $6.1 million related to acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization.

During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded $11.8 million ($7.9 million, net of tax) for acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization. These costs primarily related to integration costs resulting from recent acquisitions and were recorded in operating income. See the Notes to this reconciliation for additional detail.   (5)   Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers in 2018. During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.1 million, related to the impact of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities as a result of Argentina being a highly inflationary economy.

During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded pre-tax expenses of $0.6 million for legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident, a $8.3 million unrealized gain on the fair value adjustment of equity investments, a $0.8 million foreign currency loss on certain intercompany loans and $11.8 million in acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization.  Notes to Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to the Comparable GAAP Financial Measures Diluted EPS attributable to Equifax is adjusted for the following items: Acquisition-related amortization expense - During the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, we recorded acquisition-related amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles of $60 .7 million ( $49 .3 million, net of tax) and $57 .3 million ( $46 .9 million, net of tax), respectively. We calculate this financial measure by excluding the impact of acquisition-related amortization expense and including a benefit to reflect the material cash income tax savings resulting from the income tax deductibility of amortization for certain acquired intangibles. These financial measures are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management believes excluding the impact of amortization expense is useful because excluding acquisition-related amortization and other items that are not comparable allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Certain acquired intangibles result in material cash income tax savings which are not reflected in earnings. Management believes that including a benefit to reflect the cash income tax savings is useful as it allows investors to better value Equifax. Management makes these adjustments to earnings when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. Legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident - Legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident include legal fees to respond to subsequent litigation and government investigations for both periods presented. During the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, we recorded legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident of $0 .4 million ( $0 .3 million, net of tax) and $0 .6 million ( $0 .5 million, net of tax). Management believes excluding these charges is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. Management makes these adjustments to net income when measuring profitability, evaluating performance trends, setting performance objectives and calculating our return on invested capital. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The legal expenses related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident do not include losses accrued for certain legal proceedings and government investigations related to the 2017 cybersecurity incident. Fair market value adjustment of equity investments - During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a $3 .1 million ( $2 .1 million, net of tax) unrealized gain related to adjusting our investment in Brazil to fair value. During the first quarter of 2022 we recorded a $27 .8 million ( $22 .4 million, net of tax) unrealized gain related to adjusting our investment in Brazil to fair value. The investment in Brazil has a readily determinable fair value and is adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with unrealized gains or losses to be recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other income, net. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a $19 .5 million non-tax deductible loss related to the write down of our equity investment in Russia . During the third quarter of 2022, we completed the sale of our equity investment in Russia . Management believes excluding these charges from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, since the non-operating gains or losses are not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans - During the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, we recorded a gain of $0 .1 million and a loss of $0 .8 million, respectively, related to foreign currency impact of certain intercompany loans. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Acquisition-related costs other than acquisition amortization - During the first quarter of 2023 and 2022, we recorded $24 .7 million ( $18 .6 million, net of tax) and $11 .8 million ( $7 .9 million, net of tax), respectively, for acquisition costs other than acquisition-related amortization. These costs primarily related to integration costs resulting from recent acquisitions and were recorded in operating income. Management believes excluding this charge from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results, since a charge of such an amount is not comparable among the periods. This is consistent with how our management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. Income tax effects of stock awards that are recognized upon vesting or settlement - During the first quarter of 2023, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.7 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. During the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a tax benefit of $4.1 million related to the tax effects of deductions for stock compensation in excess of amounts recorded for compensation costs. Management believes excluding this tax effect from financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 because these amounts are non-operating and relate to income tax benefits or deficiencies for stock awards recognized when tax amounts differ from recognized stock compensation cost. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.  Argentina highly inflationary foreign currency adjustment - Argentina experienced multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, devaluation of the peso, and increasing borrowing rates. As such, Argentina was deemed a highly inflationary economy by accounting policymakers. We recorded a foreign currency loss of $0.1 million during the first quarter of 2023 as a result of remeasuring the peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities due to Argentina being highly inflationary. Management believes excluding this charge is useful as it allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Adjustments to deferred tax balances - For the first quarter of 2022, we recorded a tax expense of $3 .9 million related to adjustments to deferred tax balances resulting from changes in U.S. state tax law. Management believes excluding this tax effect from certain financial results provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our financial results since a charge of such amount for 2022 is not comparable among the periods presented. This is consistent with how management reviews and assesses Equifax's historical performance and is useful when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin - Management defines adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income attributable to Equifax plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and also excludes certain one-time items. Management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin allows investors to evaluate our performance for different periods on a more comparable basis. SOURCE Equifax Inc.
