 Japanese developer Nippon Ichi Software (NIS), and its Western publishing branch NIS America, announced today that Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless is coming to PC in the West later this fall. NIS decided to announce this news in a 30th anniversary stream for the developer/publisher, alongside other news. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless doesn’t have a solid release date yet. It’ll arrive fall 2023, roughly half a year after its debut in the Japan on January 26. Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless takes place in the demonic realm of Hinomoto, which has fallen under a tyrannical regime. This leaves the lazy warrior Fuji and bushido fangirl Pirilika to fight back. They’ll discover the meaning behind honor and redemption over the course of the game’s story. At least, that’s what NIS America has stated describing the announcement trailer. There will probably be a lot more hilarious antics in the game as well, as per Disgaea tradition.

The game is also adding new features such as “jumbification,” which sees characters in the game grow large and assume a kaiju-like form in battle. There are also other new additions such as a Hell mode, item reincarnation, and online ranked battles. Disgaea 6: Defiance of Destiny originally launched in 2021 exclusively for the Switch in the West. It received a complete edition titled Disgaea 6 Complete a year later for PC. This version includes all of the previously released DLC as part of the package. Look forward to more information on Disgaea 7: Vows of the Virtueless ahead of its launch in fall 2023.
