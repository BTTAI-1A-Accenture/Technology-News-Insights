WELFARE The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a crucial federal assistance programme in the United States that aims to provide food support to individuals and families with limited financial resources. Formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, SNAP plays a significant role in combating hunger and improving nutrition for vulnerable populations. Eligibility for SNAP benefits is primarily based on income and household size. Generally, households with gross incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty level (FPL) qualify for assistance. $2 per person per meal.That's the average SNAP benefit the GOP is chasing. Maybe they forgot why we're here. Maybe they're too busy bloating our defense budget or cashing campaign checks from Big Oil.We have a responsibility to help people. Sadly, the GOP has abandoned it. pic.twitter.com/5JZNx2iqEO These are the monthly income limits for people living in the contiguous US to qualify for SNAP benefits: One person household: $1,133 (Alaska: $1,416, Hawaii: $1,303) Two person household: $1,526 (Alaska: $1,908, Hawaii: $1,755) Three person household: $1,920 (Alaska: $2,400, Hawaii: $2,208) Four person household: $2,313 (Alaska: $2,891, Hawaii: $2,660) Five person household: $2,706 (Alaska: $3,383, Hawaii: $3,113) Six person household: $3,100 (Alaska: $3,875, Hawaii: $3,565) Seven person household: $3,493 (Alaska: $4,366, Hawaii: $4,018) Eight person household: $3,886 (Alaska: $4,858, Hawaii: $4,470) Each additional member: $394 (Alaska: $492, Hawaii: $453) The deal, called the Fiscal Responsibility Act, would expand requirements for SNAP, which was formerly known as food stamps. As the program currently stands, there are already work requirements in place for most able-bodied adults without children from the ages of 18 to 49. Why are so-called “work requirements” for government assistance so cruel?Imagine:Someone with a child is working a job paying poverty wages and uses SNAP benefits as a way to make ends meet.They lose their job.Now they no longer have an income or SNAP. That doesn’t make… These recipients must either be earning wages equivalent to 30 hours per week, looking for a job, or signed up for a SNAP employment training program for at least 80 hours a month.
