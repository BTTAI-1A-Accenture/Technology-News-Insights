CEBU, Philippines — The city of Cebu is now sold to Russia as a destination for investment, trade and tourism, so said outgoing City Legal Officer Jerone Castillo yesterday. “(Cebu City Mayor Michael) Rama was the best salesman not only in Cebu, but the entire Philippines,” said Castillo about their trip to Russia. Castillo, who is also the city’s budget and finance officer and was one of Rama’s entourage in Russia, has refuted those who said that they gained nothing from their trip in Vladivostok, Russia. “Naa na tay exchanges. Ila rang hangyo that there will be direct flights from Vladivostok to Cebu, mao ra nay hangyo nila,” said Castillo yesterday while saying, Rama is going to work on it. Rama reportedly had 20 interviews from the different outlets of the Russian Federation, Castillo said. Even City Administrator Collin Russel, despite not feeling very well, also attended several technical sessions, Castillo said. “Daghan kaayo mig nakat-unan. That’s what a fulfilling work journey, for the sake of Cebu City,” he said. Rama, for his part, said he got to attend an event with no less than the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, but said he would be discussing the details of his trip to Russia in a press conference. The mayor also disclosed that he will be returning to Russia next year, this time in Moscow, together with the other officials of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP). — (FREEMAN) Philstar.com is one of the most vibrant, opinionated, discerning communities of readers on cyberspace.
