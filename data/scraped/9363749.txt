Retail supermarket giants Kroger and Albertsons are planning to sell up to 300 stores—mostly in areas where the grocery chains overlap—to try to fend off antitrust challenges to Kroger's $25B acquisition of Albertson. The merger, announcing in October, would combine the two largest supermarket chains in the US into an entity with a nationwide footprint of nearly 5,000 stores. Earlier this month, a class-action lawsuit filed by a group of 25 US consumers argued that the merger would result in a grocery behemoth with a 36% share of the US market at a time when inflation is still gripping food prices.
