Whether it’s the remote of your television or your cellphone, semiconductors are an integral part of the devices around us and are more ubiquitous than you might think. The demand for semiconductors will keep rising as long as advancements and innovations are made in technology. In 2021, global semiconductors sales stood at $555.89 billion, up 26.2% YoY. Some of the leading semiconductor companies include Samsung Electronics, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The semiconductor industry has also been affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. The shift to work from home generated demand for more tech devices, and the semiconductor industry struggled to keep up with the demand for chips worldwide. However, as the central banks have started monetary tightening, causing a slowdown in the global economy, the demand for discretionary tech products has reduced, causing a decline in sales for semiconductor companies. In 2023, the total sales of the global semiconductor industry are forecasted to be at $596 billion, a 3.6% decline YoY. In the coming years, the applications expected to drive the global semiconductor industry include electric vehicles and smartphones. In 2020, the smartphone semiconductor market size stood at $116 billion and is forecasted to reach $162 billion by 2030. The global market size for battery electric vehicles in 2020 stood at $47 billion and is forecasted to reach $212 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.1% during the period.
