VIVA – A Fugitive billionaire Guo Wengui from China wants to auction sperm from unvaccinated donors on the right-wing social media platform Gettr, in June soon.  "Sperm and eggs from our fellow fighters will be auctioned on our Gettr platform between June 1 and June 6," Guo said.  This fugitive billionaire claimed to have gathered nearly 6,000 eggs and "millions" of sperm from unvaccinated donors and said the sale would include his sperm too. Guo said the site would use "scientific methods" and require an attorney's letter to verify the donors' vaccine status. He did not provide further information on how the samples would be tested or stored. The plan, which capitalizes on the baseless conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 vaccines cause infertility, has generated buzz among Gettr users.  Furthermore, anti-vaccine informers encourage claims of Covid-19 vaccines triggering infertility, even in the face of several medical studies that show the fact of not damage male or female fertility.  Guo, who goes by other names including Miles Guo, is himself a believer in such false claims. The New Federal State of China, an anti-Chinese Communist Party lobby group formed by Guo, has also repeatedly made unsubstantiated statements such as vaccines are biological weapons. Some supporters see this auction as a form of humanity for the allegations that the origin of COVID-19 came from a lab leak in Wuhan, China. Other social media users are interested in the auction, while others have expressed the opposite statement. According to him, the sperm auction for the unvaccinated can indeed reap a lot of money, but it does not answer the evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine is harmful to fertility.
