The Energy Institute at the University of Sheffield is finding low-carbon solutions to the worldâ€™s biggest energy challenges.  The UK sustainable aviation fuels Clearing House has officially launched, marking a major step in enabling the UK to bring new fuels to market and help reduce carbon emissions from the aviation industry. With several of the PhD projects now close to completion, we showcase our PhD students, supervisors and their projects.  Professor Lenny Koh, Cross Cutting Chief, Strategic Futures on Resource Sustainability, is the Sheffield lead for the new EPSRC manufacturing hubs. Four new research hubs aiming to address the challenge of commercialising early stage research within key areas of manufacturing, such as aerospace, medicines and semiconductors, have been launched with academics at the University of Sheffield.
