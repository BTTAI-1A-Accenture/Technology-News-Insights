 Sam Proof and I spoke about using the Elgato Stream Deck last week and some of you (keen members of #TheYard) wanted to know how you could use it with StreamYard.  There isn't a StreamYard specific plugin for the Stream Deck (at least not yet), but you can set up buttons for any keyboard shortcut you'd want to use.  1. Go to the StreamYard settings. 2. Click on the Hotkeys section. Note or change the keyboard shortcut(s) you want to use. 3. In the Stream Deck software, Drag a Hotkey (from System options) onto an empty slot. 4. Add title and/or icon (optional). 5. Click into the Hotkey text box and press the appropriate keys. The only real thing you have to keep in mind is that you have to make sure your StreamYard browser tab has focus or they keyboard shortcut won't trigger properly. We'll be talking about visual branding this week on The Video and Livestreaming Show.  So much of what we do online is highly visual. Little choices we make along the way can lead up to a visual style that may or may not have been intentional.  So how do you develop a visual style and a visual brand? When do you stick to that style and when do you deviate to interrupt your viewers' expectations?  [I'm a bit preoccupied how I show up and how I am seen (and more on that in a moment). This of course is a part of that.] We'll be looking at:  The hardest part of content creation, for me anyway, isn't writing or recording or editing or design. It's managing my own expectations and emotions. (Stop me if you've heard this one before.)  And, look, I'll be the first person to admit how I am feeling at any given time isn't necessarily indicative of the reality around me.  But lately the sound of crickets has been deafening, or at least it has felt that way.  And this feeling is misleading, because, actually: But it's kind of lonely here, and I don't really understand why. I have been trying to interact with people more often. But, also, LinkedIn isn't notifying me of everything.  Somebody left the most wonderful comment on my newsletter. The kind of reaffirming thing that a disheartened content creator might hold onto in moments when they wanted to quit. And I only found it accidentally.  I'll let you in on a secret: I don't have a business. I'm not trying to sell anything. I'm looking for kindred spirits who like making cool stuff. I just want to be helpful. And I realise being on LinkedIn for this weird abstract reason might be deeply confusing to all the people sliding into DMs to set up sales calls. But it's true.  With all of that in mind, I reflected on how I show up and how the show must go on. Admittedly a lot of this is stuff I'm negotiating inside my own (overthinking) head, but I am keen to hear from you:  Subscribe to the podcast on: Saturday 9 am Sydney time — check the event invites for your local time  If you're interested in video, livestreaming and content creation, we should connect!  Have a great week!   #LearnLivestreaming #StreamYard #StreamDeck #ContentCreator
