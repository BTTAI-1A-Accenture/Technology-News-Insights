Alabama basketball aims to score a victory over San Diego State in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament on Friday as part of March Madness. The No. 1 seed Crimson Tide (31-5) is looking to make its first appearance in the Elite Eight since the 2003-04 team, the only team to make it that far in program history. If coach Nate Oats and star freshman Brandon Miller can lead Alabama to the Final Four, it would be the first ever for the program. Standing in the way in the Sweet 16 is No. 5 seed San Diego State (29-6). The Aztecs have beaten the likes of No. 12 seed Charleston and No. 13 seed Furman en route to the matchup with the Crimson Tide at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville.
