Markets are pricing for a 25 basis-point rate hike by the Fed, bringing the interest rate to 5%. And it is most likely to reassure investors with the ability to stabilize the banking system amid the recent market turmoil. While US bond yields swung widely higher, the US dollar weakened against the Eurodollar and the Swiss Franc but strengthened against Asian currencies. Bank and energy stocks sharply rebound in Europe, pushing the regional markets higher. Following the ECB and SNBâs pledges to support the banking system, investors expect a similar tone from the US Fed. In commodities, risk-on trades sent haven assets down, with gold prices plunging 2%, while crude oil jumped as recession fears eased. Asian stock markets are set to open higher, with the ASX futures up 0.89%, the Hang Seng Index futures rising 0.73%, and Nikkei 225 futures advancing 1.65%.
