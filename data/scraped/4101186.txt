Our team of credit card experts at Business Insider chose the best options available on the market in 2024, and reviewed each one below. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card is our top pick for a well-rounded travel rewards credit card. Even infrequent travelers can benefit from the slew of premium perks on this card, typically found on cards with far higher annual fees.  The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card stands out for its travel protection benefits. When you pay for travel expenses with this card and meet certain requirements, you can request reimbursement for unexpected expenses that may arise when your flight is delayed or if your baggage is delayed or lost. You'll also have primary rental car insurance, meaning you won't have to file claims through your personal car insurance plan or pay for coverage from the rental car company. This card also offers a 10% anniversary points bonus, and up to $50 in annual statement credits for hotel purchases made through the Chase Travel℠ Portal.  The rewards rate on the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card isn't shabby either. You'll earn 5 points on travel purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards; 2 points on all other travel purchases; and 3 points on dining, online grocery purchases (excluding Target, Walmart, and wholesale clubs), and select streaming services. You'll earn 1 point per dollar on everything else. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points are some of the easiest points to use in various ways. You can redeem them for travel directly through the Chase Travel Portal for a 25% boost in value, where 1 point will be worth 1.25 cents apiece. You can also transfer your points to Chase's airline and hotel transfer partners, which include United Airlines, Hyatt, Marriott, and many other airlines and hotel chains around the world. Cardholders can also use points for statement credits, gift cards, merchandise, and more.   The Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card currently offers a welcome bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. Business Insider values Chase points at 1.8 cents each, on average, making this bonus worth around $1,080 in travel value. What the experts love: High welcome bonus offer, earns bonus points on travel, dining, and online grocery purchases, you can redeem points for 1.25 cents apiece for travel or through Chase for 25% value bonus What the experts don't love: Doesn't offer some of the travel perks you'll get with competing cards, such as airport lounge access and a statement credit for Global Entry Read more: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card card review.

It earns bonus points on a wide variety of travel and dining purchases and offers strong travel and purchase coverage, including primary car rental insurance. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a great "set it and forget it" card, in the sense that you don't have to worry about various bonus categories for earning rewards. You'll earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels, vacation rentals and rental cars booked through Capital One Travel and 2x miles on all other purchases. Capital One Venture and Spark Miles cardholders now have access to a curated list of hotels worldwide and receive benefits that include a $50 hotel experience credit, room upgrades when available, and early check-in/late checkout when available. The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card also offers one of the most straightforward ways to redeem travel rewards: You can use your miles to cover recent travel purchases from your card statement at a rate of 1 cent per mile.  You also have the option to transfer Capital One miles*** to more than a dozen frequent flyer and hotel loyalty programs, including Air Canada Aeroplan, Etihad Guest, and Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer. Capital One also added new partners including British Airways and Turkish Airlines, and improved the transfer ratio to 1:1 for most partners.  The selection of transfer partners is best suited to someone who wants to travel internationally and who doesn't mind spending some time researching the best ways to redeem miles with the different frequent flyer program options. But the upside is that you can always use your miles to cover your travel purchases. You also get up to a $100 Global Entry/TSA PreCheck application fee credit. What the experts love: The ability to use your miles to cover your recent travel expenses; it earns at least 2 miles per dollar on every purchase. What the experts don't love: Other cards offer higher rewards on certain spending categories such as travel and dining.

For a moderate annual fee, it offers plenty of value, useful benefits, and a substantial welcome bonus. The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card is our top choice for a no-annual-fee travel card (rates and fees), and it's got many of the same perks as its bigger sibling, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. New cardholders can earn a respectable 20,000 miles after spending $500 on purchases within three months from account opening (worth at least $340 in travel according to Business Insider's valuations). While the card only earns 1.25 miles per dollar on most purchases (plus 5x on hotels and car rentals booked through Capital One Travel), it's still a compelling choice if an annual fee isn't for you. You'll get the same access to Capital One's airline and hotel partners as you would with annual-fee cards, and a handful of benefits including car rental insurance***, travel accident insurance***, and purchase assurance***. This is also a solid pick if you're looking for a zero-interest credit card with a 0% introductory APR offer, because new cardholders receive a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months (intro fee of 3% for the first 15 months, then 4% of the amount of each balance transfer at a promotional APR that Capital One may offer you at any other time), then a 19.99% - 29.99% Variable APR (rates and fees).

It's one of the few no-annual-fee cards on the market that gives you the option to redeem miles for cash back or transfer them to travel partners. The Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card earns one of the highest rates of return on hotel bookings for a credit card that isn't co-branded with a specific hotel chain.  This card has a $95 annual fee, inviting direct comparisons to two other cards on this list: The Sapphire Preferred Card, and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card. In exchange, cardholders earn at least 3x on restaurants and travel purchases. Airline purchases earn 4x, and hotel purchases earn 5x. When launching this card, the card issuer simultaneously announced brand-new Wells Fargo Autograph transfer partners: Choice Privileges, Aer Lingus AerClub, Air France-KLM Flying Blue, avianca lifemiles, and British Airways Executive Club. Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card cardholders can redeem rewards at the standard redemption rate of 1 cent per point for cash back, or transfer their rewards to any travel partners above for additional value. What the experts love: High bonus rates on hotels and flights What the experts don't love: Limited transfer options (for now) Read more: Wells Fargo Autograph Journey credit card review Earn unlimited 5X points on hotels, 4X points on airlines, 3X points on other travel and restaurants, and 1X points on other purchases. $95 N/A 21.24%, 26.24%, or 29.99% Variable Earn 60,000 bonus points Good or Excellent The Wells Fargo Autograph Journey℠ Card is a true travel credit card, with benefits that rival many of the best travel rewards credit cards currently on the market. This card has a low annual fee on par with that of popular competing credit cards and Wells Fargo's newly announced Points Transfer program allows cardholders to juice maximum value from every point they earn. The Citi Strata Premier℠ Card isn't as flashy or well-known as some other travel cards, but that doesn't mean you should overlook it, especially if you spend a lot on its bonus categories. Cardholders earn an impressive 3x points on air travel, gas stations, restaurants, supermarkets, and hotels, and 1 point per dollar on everything else. Along with a solid welcome bonus offer of 75,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 in the first three months of account opening (worth $1,200 based on Business Insider's valuations), you'll receive $100 off a single hotel stay of $500 or more (excluding taxes and fees) booked through thankyou.com once per calendar year. While it isn't the best for travel protections, the Citi Strata Premier℠ Card is the only card currently available to new applicants that unlocks the ability to transfer your ThankYou points to Citi's full list of airline and hotel partners, including JetBlue, Singapore Airlines, and Wyndham. What the experts love: Strong rewards earning in useful everyday categories, access to Citi's transfer partners What the experts don't love: Lack of travel protections like car rental insurance, few travel perks compared to similar rewards cards Read more: Citi Strata Premier℠ Card review Earn a total of 10 ThankYou® Points per $1 spent on hotel, car rentals and attractions booked through CitiTravel.com. Earn 3X points per $1 on air travel and other hotel purchases, at restaurants, supermarkets, gas stations and EV charging stations.

New cardholders can earn 25,000 online bonus points after spending $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days from account opening (redeemed as a $250 statement credit toward travel and dining purchases). That's a decent offer for a no-annual-fee card, and the earning structure is simple, too — 1.5x points per dollar on every purchase, with no bonus categories to keep track of. There's also a 0% intro APR for your first 18 billing cycles for purchases, and for any balance transfers made within the first 60 days of opening your account (then a 17.99% - 27.99% Variable APR) which can be handy if you have big purchases (like textbooks or supplies) you want to pay for over time.  The Bank of America® Travel Rewards Credit Card for Students is a good choice if you prefer a straightforward card without having to worry about award charts or transfer partners. It's also a safe bet if you want to use it while traveling internationally — it doesn't charge pesky foreign transaction fees, so you won't be on the hook for extra charges if you use it overseas. However, you won't find many extras — like travel benefits or purchase protections — with this card. If you're looking for better benefits, be sure to check out our guide to the best student credit cards for all the top options.

However, while the card is marketed to students, those without established credit may have difficulty getting approved. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card was unveiled in late 2021 and offers a massive welcome bonus of 75,000 bonus miles when you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening — worth at least $1,275 in travel, based on Business Insider's valuation of Capital One miles. The Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card is loaded with premium benefits that can more than offset the $395 annual fee (rates and fees). For context, this annual fee is significantly lower than that of other premium travel cards which offer airport lounge access.  Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card cardholders also receive $300 per year in credits toward travel booked through Capital One; Priority Pass, Plaza Premium, and Capital One airport lounge access (even for authorized users, for free); a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary (worth $100 in travel); and Visa Infinite travel and purchase benefits. Through the Capital One Premier Collection, Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card cardholders can access hundreds of premium hotels and resorts worldwide and receive elite-like benefits such as free breakfast, room upgrades, and on-property credits. As with other cards that earn Capital One miles, you can transfer rewards to over a dozen airline and hotel partners to book award travel, or use miles to book through the Capital One Travel Portal. What the experts love: Between $300 a year in travel credit and a 10,000-mile bonus on each account anniversary, you can offset the annual fee entirely — and that's not even considering other benefits like lounge access. What the experts don't love: The $300 travel credit is more restrictive than other cards' — it only applies to travel booked through Capital One.

It comes with a generous welcome bonus and credits that can help offset the annual fee — which is much lower than similar premium cards. The American Express® Gold Card is an ideal travel card for anyone who frequently eats out and/or shops at U.S. supermarkets. You'll earn 4X Membership Rewards® points on purchases at restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1X points), 4X Membership Rewards® points at US supermarkets (on up to $25,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1X points), 3X Membership Rewards® points on flights booked directly with airlines or on AmexTravel.com, 2X Membership Rewards® points on prepaid hotels and other eligible purchases booked on AmexTravel.com, and 1X Membership Rewards® point on all other eligible purchases. You can get up to $120 in annual dining credits after enrollment, but it's divided into up to $10 in credits each month, and the credit only applies at select restaurants and delivery services at Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys. You'll also get up to $120 Uber Cash ($10 per month) credit each calendar year (this is only applicable to U.S. Eats orders and rides, and the Gold Card needs to be added as a method of payment to the Uber app to receive the Uber Cash benefit). What the experts love: "4x points on restaurants worldwide (on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1x) and at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25,000 per year, then 1x) is great — usually, a card favors one or the other," says Rathner. Plus, the card offers monthly dining credits. What the experts don't love: Wilson notes that other cards offer similar benefits for a lower annual fee, and Rathner notes that the card's travel and dining credits come with some important limitations — so read the fine print.  Read more: American Express® Gold Card review Earn 4X Membership Rewards® points per dollar spent on purchases at restaurants worldwide, on up to $50,000 in purchases per calendar year, then 1X points for the rest of the year.

Its Uber Cash credits are useful for rides and Uber Eats, and monthly dining credits with participating merchants like GrubHub and Seamless are easy to use. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® has a $550 annual fee, which means it's not for everybody, but if you're serious about maximizing your rewards and you travel frequently, it could be worth it. It offers a bonus of 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening.  Not only do you get up to $300 in statement credits toward travel each year (and Chase has a very generous definition of travel — including everything from airfare to highway tolls), but you also earn 5x total points on air travel and 10x total points on hotels and car rentals purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards (excluding the $300 travel credit) and 3x points on all other travel and dining. You also get airport lounge access through the Priority Pass network, which has more than 1,300 locations worldwide. The Priority Pass membership that comes with the Chase Sapphire Reserve® offers the most comprehensive version of Priority Pass access to lounges and restaurants worldwide, compared to that of the Amex Platinum Card or the Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card. New benefits also include access to Chase Sapphire lounges in JFK, LaGuardia, Boston, and Hong Kong, as well as the Chase Sapphire Terrace at Austin Airport. You'll also receive benefit with DoorDash that can save you money on delivery (activation required). The Chase Sapphire Reserve® is currently offering cardholders two years of complimentary Lyft Pink All Access membership (valued at $199 per year) for member-exclusive pricing, priority pickup, and more (activation required).  When it comes to redeeming points, you can book travel through Chase and get 1.5 cents per point (a 50% bonus over the standard 1-cent-per-point rate), or you can transfer your Chase Ultimate Rewards to travel partners like Hyatt, British Airways, and United. Plus, like the less-expensive Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® offers some of the best credit card travel insurance around. This includes primary car rental insurance, trip delay insurance, trip cancellation protection, and lost baggage insurance. The Chase Sapphire Reserve® card was previously our pick for the best travel card overall, before the annual fee increased from $450 to $550. While the Reserve did add some additional benefits, the Reserve no longer makes as much sense for casual travelers. As a result, we now recommend the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card as the best travel credit card for most people.  What the experts love: Earns 3x points on travel and dining purchases made outside of Chase Travel Portal, annual $300 travel credit, points are worth 1.5 cents apiece for travel booked through Chase What the experts don't love: You have to squeeze every drop of value out of this card to make that jaw-dropping $550 annual fee worth your while.

The Platinum Card® from American Express has one of the highest rewards card annual fees —  $695 — but it can still be well worth it if you can put all of its statement credits and generous welcome bonus offer to use. You'll earn 5x points on flights when you book directly through the airline or through American Express Travel (on up to $500,000 per calendar year), which makes the card a great choice for purchasing airfare. The card offers trip cancellation and interruption insurance, plus some of the best purchase protection, so it's a good option for buying expensive items (and don't forget to see if you can take advantage of an Amex Offer** for bonus points or cash back). The Platinum Card® from American Express offers more airport lounge access than any other personal travel card — in addition to Priority Pass membership**, you get access to Amex Centurion Lounges, Delta Sky Clubs (when you're flying Delta), and more.  The card's annual statement credits can go a long way toward offsetting the high annual fee. You get up to $200 in statement credits toward airline incidental fees** like checked bags and inflight purchases; up to $100 each year in credit toward Saks Fifth Avenue purchases**; and up to $200 in annual Uber credits (including Uber Eats)**.  The Platinum Card® from American Express comes with a range of valuable benefits, including up to $300 annually in Equinox credits**, $199 per year in credits for CLEAR® Plus membership**, up to $200 per year in credits toward eligible prepaid hotel bookings, up to $240 in annual credits toward eligible digital subscriptions**, a monthly credit for Walmart+ membership**, and up to $300 back for purchasing a SoulCycle At-Home Bike through Equinox+. Just keep in mind that you're limited to one designated airline you choose each year in your Amex account for the airline incidental fee credit, and both the Saks and Uber credits are divided into portions. You'll get up to $50 in statement credits toward Saks purchases from January to June, and another credit of up to $50 for Saks purchases from July to December. With the Uber credit, you get up to $15 each month, and a $20 bonus in December for a total of $35 that month.

Read Business Insider's guide to points and miles valuations to find out what your airline miles, hotel points, and credit card rewards are worth. Here's our methodology for assigning a cash value to your points and miles. While it takes more effort to redeem points or miles compared to cash back, the upside is that you can get much more value for your points compared to simply cashing in your rewards for a statement credit or check at a rate of 1 cent per point. In fact, it's possible to receive double, triple, or even more than that amount when you're strategic about how you redeem your rewards, particularly if you book expensive luxury hotels or first-class flights.  In this guide, we've focused mostly on the best travel credit cards that earn transferable points. Transferable points include popular currencies such as: You can transfer these points to both airline and hotel partner loyalty programs. You can even redeem your points to offset the cash price of your travel at a flat rate. Travel credit cards offer various benefits including earning points or miles on travel and everyday purchases, access to travel perks such as lounge access and travel insurance, and often come with sign-up bonuses that can be redeemed for free flights or hotel stays. When choosing the best travel credit card, consider your travel habits, preferred airlines or hotel chains, annual fee tolerance, and the rewards and benefits offered by the card. Compare different cards to find one that aligns with your specific needs and travel goals. Some potential downsides include annual fees, higher interest rates if you carry a balance, and rewards programs that might be restrictive if you don't travel frequently. It's important to weigh these factors against the benefits to determine if a travel credit card is right for you. Yes, most travel credit cards allow you to earn points or miles on everyday purchases, which can help you accumulate rewards faster. However, the earning rate may vary depending on the spending category. Look for a rewards program that offers a high earning rate on travel-related purchases, flexible redemption options, valuable travel perks, and a generous sign-up bonus. Additionally, consider if the card offers rewards that align with your travel preferences and spending habits. To pick the right travel credit card for you, you'll want to evaluate its welcome bonus offer, ease of use, benefits, and annual fee. The best one for you will ideally have a combination of an attractive sign-up bonus, lots of options for earning and redeeming rewards, benefits that save you money, and a low or no annual fee. If you want a single credit card that does it all and don't mind paying a generous annual fee, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® is a great choice. It comes with the best travel insurance available on the market, as well as a $300 travel credit each year that can be used on most types of travel. The best travel credit card overall is the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, but the best card for your particular situation will depend on what benefits you care about the most, as well as how you feel about paying a high annual fee.  We'd recommend opening a travel card that earns Amex or Chase points, because these are among the easiest rewards to redeem and you have various travel partners to utilize. But if you've investigated your options and are confident that you can get value out of their rewards, credit cards that earn Capital One miles or Citi ThankYou points can make sense as well. There are two main types of travel credit cards: Cards that earn transferable points, and airline/hotel co-branded credit cards. Transferable points currencies include Amex Membership Rewards points, Capital One miles, and Chase Ultimate Rewards points.  Airline credit cards and hotel credit cards earn points or miles within a respective hotel or airline program; you don't have the option to redeem your rewards with a wide variety of travel partners (or if you do, the transfer ratio usually isn't great). Travel credit cards with annual fees are worth it if you're able to get significant value out of their benefits and rewards. Before you apply for a card, make sure you'll actually use all the features that contribute to the card's annual fee. For example, if a card offers an annual statement credit of up to $200 toward travel but you can't use it, you're probably not getting what you pay for. Travel credit cards work by earning you points (or miles) on every purchase you make, with the goal of helping you earn enough rewards to book free travel. The best travel cards earn points that you can transfer to various airline and hotel partners — like Amex, Chase, or Citi points.  A great way to work toward getting a free flight is by applying for a travel credit card and earning its welcome bonus offer. Domestic award flights in economy class typically require about 25,000 points, so depending on the welcome bonus offer, you could have enough rewards for a flight right out of the gate.  Business Insider evaluated dozens of travel credit cards currently available to new applicants and narrowed down the list to the best options based on the following factors: Read our guide to how we rate credit cards for a closer look at our methodology.
