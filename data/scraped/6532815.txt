Brand's low minimum investment threshold lowers entry barriers for potential investors Innovative fintech start-up CAT (Crypto Arbitrage Team) has announced its expansion into the MENA and Gulf regions, aligning with its mission for global financial inclusion and technological advancement. The move comes as Coherent Market Insights estimates that the global cryptocurrency market is poised to exceed $6.716 trillion and exhibit a CAGR of 56.2 per cent by 2025. The MENA and Gulf are characterised by a young, tech-savvy population—almost 55 per cent of the populace under 30 — eager to embrace financial innovations like cryptocurrencies. CAT has made a name for itself by democratising access to the traditionally complex arena of crypto arbitrage through its bespoke Bot. “Our technology enables even individual investors to profit from price differences in digital assets across various exchanges,” explains Harry Burton, CEO of CAT. Since its launch in August 2022, CAT has won around 25,000 active users globally and generated over 1 million BNB in user earnings. With a low minimum investment threshold of just 0.1 BNB and regular Daily Profit of up to 2.7 per cent, CAT lowers entry barriers for potential investors. This democratisation is particularly significant for the MENA and Gulf markets, where there is a burgeoning need for financial inclusion and alternative investment channels as these regions face economic challenges like inequitable income distribution and high youth unemployment, making alternative financial instruments particularly attractive. What distinguishes CAT further is its emphasis on transparency and education. The platform offers full transactional transparency to mitigate the issue of investor mistrust, a common concern in the cryptocurrency sphere. Additionally, CAT is committed to educating its users, aiming to demystify the complexities surrounding digital assets and crypto markets. Aside from its core offerings, CAT has designed a unique affiliate marketing program, operating on a multi-level marketing principle, allowing for rapid scalability. This program not only drives user engagement but also provides a robust framework for capital inflow, aligning with CAT’s ambitious goals to be among the top 10 crypto arbitrage teams and to form a billion-dollar CAT Fund. “As we expand into the MENA and Gulf, we're not just growing our user base but also acting as a force for financial empowerment,” Burton concludes. “CAT is poised to redefine the crypto arbitrage landscape, making it accessible and profitable for a much wider audience.” Growth is expected to be supported by CAT’s referral program, which is built on a multi-level marketing structure, allowing users to expand their earning potential through a tiered bonus system. By sharing a personalized referral link, investors not only boost their daily income by up to 10 per cent, but they also contribute to the rapid scalability of CAT’s trading capital. CAT operates outside the framework of traditional financial institutions like banks and exchanges, eliminating the need for regulatory licenses. Comprised of a skilled team of developers, traders, and analysts, the company specialises in automated high-frequency trading and crypto arbitrage. By developing a tool designed to provide stable income for investors, CAT has positioned itself as a leading fintech start-up in the emerging field of automated crypto arbitrage. The project invites investors to join its rapidly expanding community, empowering individuals to maximize their returns while contributing to a platform poised to revolutionize crypto arbitrage in the MENA and Gulf regions.
