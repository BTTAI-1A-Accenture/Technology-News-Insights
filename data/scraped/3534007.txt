Headed for a divorce already? Byju‚Äôs acquisition of Aaskash has hit several roadblocks over the course of the last couple of months. Reportedly, the founders of Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL), the Chaudary family, told the edtech giant that the merger would be terminated.

However, Byju‚Äôs sources revealed to Inc42 that Akash is legally bound, as a part of the agreement, to complete its share swap.  Byju‚Äôs has reportedly sent a legal notice to Aakash for their reluctance in going ahead with the share swap.
