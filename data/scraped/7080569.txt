Americas+1 212 318 2000  EMEA+44 20 7330 7500  Asia Pacific+65 6212 1000  By Mary Anne Pazanowski The Indiana Supreme Court wonât reconsider whether the stateâs near-total ban on abortion should be blocked while further proceedings to determine its validity under the state constitution take place, it said Monday. The court allowed the ban to take effect on June 30, saying that it doesnât violate a fundamental right of access to the procedure in all circumstances. It also said, however, that the Indiana Constitution protects a personâs right to have an abortion when needed to save their life. Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky Inc. filed for a rehearing on July 31. The constitutionally protected right to a life-saving abortion is broader than the lawâs exception for abortions needed âto prevent death or a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function,â the group said.  If the constitutional right protects access to abortion in circumstances not covered by the lawâs current life-health exception, then allowing the law to take effect might cause abortion patients âto suffer serious (and unconstitutional) consequences while the trial courtâ considers evidence on a novel question, the group said in its petition. The court didnât give any reasons for Mondayâs order denying the motion for a rehearing.  In a concurring opinion, Chief Justice Loretta H. Rush said that Planned Parenthood improperly asked to keep the entire injunction in place while it went back to the trial court to ask for a narrower injunction defining the scope of the constitutional right to life.  âThere is simply no sound legal basis for an interim injunction that is even broader than the relief Plaintiffs intend to pursue in the trial court,â Rush said. Justice Christopher M. Goff dissented from the rehearing denial. No one knows âthe precise contours ofâ the life-health exception, he said. âHaving declared the right of a woman to protect her health, this Court should not now let that right go unprotectedâ while the case proceeds, he said. Goff said he would put a limited, state-wide injunction in place so that the trial court could consider whether to issue a new injunction or for lawmakers to revise the statute. Indianaâs law bans all abortions with three narrow exceptions, including a health-life exception. It was one of the first state laws to take effect after the US Supreme Court said in Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâs Health Organization that thereâs no federal constitutional right to abortion. A state trial court had halted its enforcement based on the state constitutionâs inalienable rights clause, which mirrors language found in other statesâ founding documents. That court will now be asked to determine if the lawâs hospitalization provision violates the state constitutionâs equal privileges and immunities clause, which wasnât part of the appeal. The state high court said its decision also doesnât prevent future abortion litigation in Indiana, because thereâs been no showing that every single part of the law can be applied consistently with the state constitution in every conceivable set of circumstances.
