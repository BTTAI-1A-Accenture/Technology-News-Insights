(NASDAQ:CHUY) in its Q4 2022 investor letter: “One restaurant company we bought during the quarter was the Tex-Mex chain Chuy’s Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHUY). We had owned Chuy’s in the past, so we’re very familiar with the company and its loyal customer base. Today, we find the stock’s valuation to be attractive based on the company’s healthy balance sheet, strong free cash flows, and ability to add locations and improve sales per location over the long term. Management also did a great job navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, and the result is a business that uses labor more efficiently and manages costs better than it did before the pandemic. Going forward, lower prices for food and other inputs should also provide a tailwind to company margins.” Photo by Syed Ahmad on Unsplash Chuy’s Holdings, Inc.
