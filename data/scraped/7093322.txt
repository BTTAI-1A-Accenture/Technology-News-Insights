Lineage Logistics, a temperature-controlled industrial Real Estate Investment Trust based in Novi, announced it has partially closed a joint venture arrangement with Hanoi, Vietnam-based cold-storage warehouse operator SK Logistics. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. âPartnering with SK Logistics is a remarkable opportunity for us to continue delivering world class cold storage solutions in the Asia Pacific region alongside a proud and thriving family business,â says Brooke Miller,Â president for Asia Pacific at Lineage. âThese facilities serve a wide range of customers, including supermarket chains that provide food for families across the region. âWe are excited to keep growing these valuable relationships together with SK Logistics as we continue in our mission to feed the world. Vietnam is an important market for Lineage, and partnering with a reliable and proven operator like SK Logistics helps us to continue delivering excellence in supply chain solutions in the region.â SK Logisticsâ two cold storage warehouses, totaling almost 400,000 square feet, represent an increase in capacity in northern Vietnam for Lineage. The facilities offer storage, distribution, stamping, weighing, classification, packing, and picking services for customers in the region. Lineage in Vietnam now has integrated assets and supply chain solutions in both the northern and southern ends of the country, with facilities in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
