An iconic bit of Charleston will soon be gone. Employees will be getting ready to say their goodbyes at Charleston Department Store â€“ a capital city icon that has been in business more than a hundred years and will close in the spring. "I've lived in Charleston 36 years," David Mitchell said. "I've been shopping here for things I don't find elsewhere." %7D%20(WCHS)%7Bp%7D%7B/p%7D" data-duration="" data-externalid="3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e" data-mediatype="image" data-renditions="%7B%22large16x9%22:%7B%22blurSigma%22:-1,%22height%22:577,%22label%22:%22large16x9%22,%22scaleWidth%22:986,%22url%22:%22/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-large16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873%22,%22width%22:1025,%22x%22:163,%22y%22:0,%22uuid%22:null,%22id%22:%225476bd6e-f670-4243-9388-1700ba2e451e%22,%22preciseWidth%22:null,%22preciseHeight%22:null,%22name%22:%22large16x9Url%22,%22rendition%22:%22large16x9%22,%22labelOrConvertedName%22:%22large16x9%22%7D,%22jumbo16x9%22:%7B%22blurSigma%22:-1,%22height%22:577,%22label%22:%22jumbo16x9%22,%22scaleWidth%22:1320,%22url%22:%22/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-jumbo16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873%22,%22width%22:1025,%22x%22:163,%22y%22:0,%22uuid%22:null,%22id%22:%22ab7b6980-4aa0-4eec-9e27-0e438d950f14%22,%22preciseWidth%22:null,%22preciseHeight%22:null,%22name%22:%22jumbo16x9Url%22,%22rendition%22:%22jumbo16x9%22,%22labelOrConvertedName%22:%22jumbo16x9%22%7D,%22small16x9%22:%7B%22blurSigma%22:-1,%22height%22:577,%22label%22:%22small16x9%22,%22scaleWidth%22:160,%22url%22:%22/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-small16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873%22,%22width%22:1025,%22x%22:163,%22y%22:0,%22uuid%22:null,%22id%22:%2261053570-80a7-4fe9-adb1-79840c451cc5%22,%22preciseWidth%22:null,%22preciseHeight%22:null,%22name%22:%22small16x9Url%22,%22rendition%22:%22small16x9%22,%22labelOrConvertedName%22:%22small16x9%22%7D,%22full16x9%22:%7B%22blurSigma%22:-1,%22height%22:577,%22label%22:%22full16x9%22,%22scaleWidth%22:1025,%22url%22:%22/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-full16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873%22,%22width%22:1025,%22x%22:163,%22y%22:0,%22uuid%22:null,%22id%22:%22237c46bb-6a04-4cc9-9529-0a74794b1443%22,%22preciseWidth%22:null,%22preciseHeight%22:null,%22name%22:%22full16x9Url%22,%22rendition%22:%22full16x9%22,%22labelOrConvertedName%22:%22full16x9%22%7D,%22medium16x9%22:%7B%22blurSigma%22:-1,%22height%22:577,%22label%22:%22medium16x9%22,%22scaleWidth%22:648,%22url%22:%22/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-medium16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873%22,%22width%22:1025,%22x%22:163,%22y%22:0,%22uuid%22:null,%22id%22:%226172f234-f896-44fb-9575-1f5e1bfc94fb%22,%22preciseWidth%22:null,%22preciseHeight%22:null,%22name%22:%22medium16x9Url%22,%22rendition%22:%22medium16x9%22,%22labelOrConvertedName%22:%22medium16x9%22%7D%7D" data-thumburl="/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-medium16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873" data-title="Customer" data-url="" data-defaultthumb="true" data-embed-file="%0A%20%20%20%20%3Cdiv%20class=%22sda-ImageEmbed%22%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%3Cimg%20src=%22/resources/media/3e929780-ee69-4573-baf5-4b6507efda3e-medium16x9_DavidMitchell.jpg?1673044480873%22%20alt=%22%22%20/%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%3Cdiv%20class=%22sda-ImageEmbed-caption%22%3E%22I've%20lived%20in%20Charleston%2036%20years,%22%20shopper%20David%20Mitchell%20says.%20%22I've%20been%20shopping%20here%20for%20things%20I%20don't%20find%20elsewhere.%22%20(WCHS)%3Cp%3E%3C/p%3E%3C/div%3E%0A%20%20%20%20%3C/div%3E%0A" data-embed-type="image" contenteditable="false" ><="" sd-embed=""> In 2021, the store marked 100 years of service. It's been on Washington Street West since the late 1970s and it expanded to 20,000 square feet about 30 years ago. Scores of employees, like Donnie Wilson, over the decades have welcomed generations of shoppers. It's an emotional time for them. After working here 44 years, Wilson said she is like part of the fixtures. "All my days are pretty good," Wilson said.

The store's been a favorite for people shopping for school uniforms, scrubs and other work clothes. West Virginia and Marshall University apparel also have been popular. It's not just the shoppers who will miss this place. The employees have made a lot of friends along the way. "We just have great times," manager Tasha Ellis said. "We are more like family than anything. That's what is going to hurt the most." From the first floor, to the second floor, around the racks of clothing - all the memories will live in between for the people who worked here who called this business their family. "Just the relationships you build with the customers. They know you. They know my son. That part I will miss," Ellis said. There is no definite date for the store to close, but it will be this spring. Additional locations of Charleston Department Store were opened in the 1980s and 1990s at the Kanawha Mall and in Elkview, Southridge and Teays Valley.
