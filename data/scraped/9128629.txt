Published on By Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma has advocated the use of digital technology for the management of forests in Nigeria, saying it would make the fight against the use of forests for criminal activities easier. Uzodinma stated this on Thursday at the inauguration of the Imo State Command of the Nigerian Hunters and Forestry Security Service (NHFSS) which took place at the Youth Centre, Owerri. Represented by the state Commissioner for Digital Economy, Dr. Chimezie Amadi, Uzodinma said the easiest way to make the job of the forestry security service easier and more effective was through what he called Digital Forest, whereby modern technology is deployed. According to him, it would also engender millions of jobs for the youths joining the Service. He, therefore, pledged to partner the leadership of the NHFSS in the area of training and other aspects for the Service officers and men. The Commander General of the NHFSS, Ambassador Dr. Osetimehim Joshua, while speaking after inaugurating the Imo State Command, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his efforts in the fight against terrorism, banditry, kidnapping and other forms of criminality in the country. He said the NHFSS was prepared and ready to contribute to the fight against crimes, especially illegal activities that are carried out from the forests. He charged officers and men of the Imo State Command to be up and doing to ensure that the use of forests and farms by gunmen and others for heinous crimes, is brought to an end. He warned against internal bickering in the Imo State command and affirmed that Dr. Fabian Iwuoha is the authentic NHFSS Commander of the state. The Commander General urged the Governor to call on President Buhari to sign the NHFSS Bill into law, as it would help in equipping the Service with the necessary legal and operational tools for effective service delivery. âWe are aware of the security challenges facing Imo State and the efforts of the Governor in confronting them with the view of making the state safe for living and for business. âLet me assure His Excellency that the Hunters and Forestry Security Service would play necessary roles to compliment the Police and other Security agencies in combating insecurity and other crimes in Imo State, especially when the Bill is signed by Mr. President,â he stated. He commended some state governors for adopting NHFSS into their states security system, training of their personnel as well as donation of operational vehicles to enhance their jobs and solicited the same support from Imo State Governor. Chief Metchie said NHFSS are also concerned about the crucial role of its Service in the protection of the entire ecosystem, climate and wildlife. âThis is because the abuse of nature, especially the shrinking of forests through illegal activities like logging has impacted negatively on the ecosystem, badly affected global climate condition which in turn is the major cause of depletion of ozone layers with resultant global warming, flooding, desertification, hurricanes and tsunamis, among others. âI therefore believe that Hunters and Forest Security Service, working with the Nigeria Police, NSCDC and other security agencies, would play an eminent role in protecting the forests from abuse as well as give morale to farmers to go back to their farms and produce food for our teeming population,â he added.
