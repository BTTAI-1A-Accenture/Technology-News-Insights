 The Marine Education Center works across The University of Southern Mississippi’s
                        Coastal Operations as Partners in STEM to engage members of diverse communities in ocean sciences, promoting careers and
                        fostering community involvement through formal and informal education programs that
                        provide participants with a better understanding of the Gulf of Mexico.     The center promotes understanding of coastal and marine science within the public
                        sector and provides the tools coastal residents can use to become more effective stewards
                        and advocates for the Gulf of Mexico through innovative, field-based educational experiences.
                        A visit to the Marine Education Center takes visitors through different coastal habitats
                        including the sensitive transition from forested bayhead to tidal marsh as seen from
                        the pedestrian suspension bridge on campus.          Marine Education Center101 Sweet Bay DriveOcean Springs, MS 39564 GCRL - Cedar Point Campus Map Emailmarine.educationFREEMississippi Phone228.818.8095   Our Sponsors  Gulf Coast Feature Connecting People with Coastal Sciences and Research 118 College DriveHattiesburg, MS 39406-0001 601.266.1000 Contact Us Hattiesburg Campus Map 730 East Beach BoulevardLong Beach, MS 39560 228.865.4500 Contact Us Gulf Park Campus Map © 2024 The University of Southern Mississippi.
