Here's how to stream the star-studded concert at Windsor Castle. The line-up for the coronation concert celebrating King Charles and Queen Camilla is, as the BBC puts it, "eclectic." Featuring Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, Nicole Scherzinger, Tiwa Savage, and more musicians, the event will take place on the grounds of Windsor Castle the day after Charles's historic coronation service. "To share the stage with the other performers at the Coronation Concert is a once-in-a-lifetime event and it will be an honor and a celebration," Richie said in a statement. King Charles and Queen Camilla will be in the stands to watch the concert, as will other members of the royal family; Prince William is reportedly set to take the stage to pay tribute to his father; and in total, 20,000 members of the public will be at Windsor to take in the show. The BBC will broadcast the concert live, on BBC News and BBC.com. In the U.S., the concert will be broadcast on PBS from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. eastern time.
