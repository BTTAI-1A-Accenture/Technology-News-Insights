WSC has found great players to come to play for the Tetons since Terry Olsen coached the team in the 1980's. "Ever since I can remember seeing Williston State men's games, they have always had good connections with Trinidad," Head Coach Alex Herman said. "I am excited to continue that and I also need to thank Hunter Berg for getting me in touch with numerous people that have helped keep that pipeline open over the years."  Javascript is required for you to be able to read premium content.
