Further improvements to production are expected in the fourth quarter.   Direct operating costs remained largely consistent with the second quarter as inflation pressures continued to stabilize, with improvements to pricing on commodities, as well lower direct costs as a result of the suspension of operations at Peñasquito. AISC was lower due to lower sustaining capital during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Peñasquito incurred $78 million of operating costs and $53 million of depreciation and amortization while operations were suspended. These costs have not been adjusted from Newmont's Non-GAAP financial metrics for the third quarter.   Cash flow from continuing operations was $1,001 million, which was favorable compared to the second quarter, primarily driven by favorable working capital changes, including the timing of accounts payable, draw-downs of lower cost inventory and lower cash tax payments. During the quarter, Newmont reinvested $604 million in capital spend, including $264 million in development capital spend to continue to progress near-term projects and $340 million in sustaining capital to progress site improvement projects.   THIRD QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL AND PRODUCTION SUMMARY   Attributable gold production  1  decreased 13 percent to 1,291 thousand ounces from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower production at Peñasquito, Akyem and Ahafo. In addition, lower than planned production was delivered from the non-managed joint venture at Pueblo Viejo. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by higher production at Yanacocha.  Gold sales  were largely in line with production for the quarter.   Gold CAS  totaled $1.3 billion for the quarter.  Gold CAS per ounce  2  increased 5 percent to $1,019 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gold sales volumes as a result of the Peñasquito labor strike for the duration of the third quarter of 2023. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by lower energy, materials and contracted services costs at Peñasquito while operations were suspended.   Gold AISC per ounce  2  increased 12 percent to $1,426 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher CAS per gold ounce and higher sustaining capital spend.   Attributable gold equivalent ounce (GEO) production from other metals  decreased 81 percent to 58 thousand ounces primarily due to the suspension of operations at Peñasquito, which were partially offset by higher copper production at Boddington.  GEO sales  were largely in line with production for the quarter.   CAS from other metals  totaled $98 million for the quarter.  CAS per GEO  2  increased 130 percent to $1,636 per ounce from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower other metal sales as a result of the Peñasquito labor strike for the duration of the third quarter of 2023. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by lower energy, materials and contracted services costs at Peñasquito while operations were suspended.   AISC per GEO  2  increased 142 percent to $2,422 per ounce primarily due to higher CAS per GEO as a result of the Peñasquito labor strike.   Average realized gold price  was $1,920, an increase of $229 per ounce over the prior year quarter. Average realized gold price includes $1,929 per ounce of gross price received, an unfavorable impact of $4 per ounce mark-to-market on provisionally-priced sales and reductions of $5 per ounce for treatment and refining charges.   Revenue  decreased 5 percent from the prior year quarter to $2.5 billion primarily due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by higher average realized gold and copper prices.   Net income from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders  was $157 million or $0.20 per diluted share, a decrease of $61 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the Peñasquito labor strike, as well as higher reclamation and remediation charges. These decreases were partially offset by higher average realized prices for gold and copper and lower CAS.   Adjusted net income  3  was $286 million or $0.36 per diluted share,  compared to $212 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments to third quarter net income include reclamation and remediation charges of $104 million, changes in the fair value of investments of $41 million, Newcrest transaction-related costs of $16 million and restructuring and severance costs of $7 million.   Adjusted EBITDA  3  increased 10 percent to $933 million for the quarter, compared to $850 million for the prior year quarter.   Capital expenditures  4  increased 14 percent from the prior year quarter to $604 million primarily due to higher sustaining capital spend. Development capital expenditures in 2023 primarily relate to Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1.   Consolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations  increased 115 percent from the prior year quarter to $1,001 million primarily due to payments made in the third quarter of 2022 related to 2021 site performance for the Peñasquito Profit-Sharing Agreement, as well as the timing of accounts payable and prepaid taxes at Peñasquito, partially offset by a decrease in revenue due to lower sales volumes primarily as a result of the strike at Peñasquito.   Free Cash Flow  5  increased to $397 million from $(63) million in the prior year quarter primarily due to higher operating cash flow, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.   Balance sheet and liquidity  remained strong in the third quarter, ending the quarter with $3.2 billion of consolidated cash, with approximately $6.2 billion of total liquidity; reported net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 0.7x  7  .   Nevada Gold Mines (NGM)  6  attributable gold production was 300 thousand ounces, with CAS of $992 per ounce  2  and AISC of $1,307 per ounce  2  for the third quarter. NGM EBITDA  7  was $263 million.   Pueblo Viejo (PV)  6  attributable gold production was 52 thousand ounces for the quarter. Cash distributions received for the Company's equity method investment in Pueblo Viejo totaled $32 million in the third quarter. Capital contributions of $23 million were made during the quarter related to the expansion project at Pueblo Viejo.   1    Attributable gold production includes 52 thousand ounces for the third quarter of 2023, 51 thousand ounces for the second quarter of 2023, and 60 thousand ounces for the first quarter of 2023 and 81 thousand ounces for the third quarter of 2022 from the Company's equity method investment in Pueblo Viejo (40%).   2    Non-GAAP measure.

In addition, Newmont has a 40% interest in Pueblo Viejo, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.   7    Non-GAAP measure. See end of this release for reconciliation.   Progressing Profitable Near-Term Projects from Unmatched Organic Pipeline   Newmont's project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine lives  1  . Newmont's 2023 and longer-term outlook includes current development capital costs and production related to Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1. Development capital spend and all metal production for Yanacocha Sulfides has been excluded from longer-term outlook until an investment decision has been reached.   Additional projects not listed below represent incremental improvements to the Company's outlook.   1    Project estimates remain subject to change based upon uncertainties, including future market conditions, macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, changes in interest rates, inflation, commodities and raw materials prices, supply chain disruptions, labor markets, engineering and mine plan assumptions, future funding decisions, consideration of strategic capital allocation and other factors, which may impact estimated capital expenditures, AISC and timing of projects. See end of this release for cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements.   2    Total resources presented for Ahafo North includes Measured and Indicated resources of 910 thousand gold ounces and Inferred resources of 490 thousand gold ounces. See cautionary statement at the end of this release.   Revised 2023 Outlook Incorporating the Resolution of the Peñasquito Strike   Newmont is providing a revised 2023 outlook for the standalone Newmont portfolio of 5.3 million ounces of attributable production to incorporate the impacts of the Peñasquito strike, lower production from the non-managed Nevada Gold Mines and Pueblo Viejo joint ventures, and lower production at Ahafo due to lower throughput following the decision to operate at less than full capacity to protect one of the grinding mill's girth gears until it is replaced. As a result of these volume impacts, 2023 CAS is expected to be approximately $1,000 per ounce, with AISC of $1,400 per ounce. In addition, as a result of the Peñasquito strike, the outlook for silver, lead and zinc has been revised for the remainder of the year.   Sustaining capital is expected to be $1.4 billion for 2023, incorporating increased spend from the upgrading of camp conditions at Musselwhite, the addition of five new autonomous haulage trucks at Boddington to advance stripping in the North and South Pits and the replacement conveyor at Ahafo. Development capital is expected to be $1.1 billion for 2023, incorporating reduced spend at Yanacocha Sulfides and the timing of spend at Tanami Expansion 2 as a result of the rainfall event in the first quarter.   Copper guidance for Boddington remains unchanged for the year. In addition, consolidated expense guidance remains unchanged, with the exception of Depreciation and Amortization as a result of the lower production volumes for the year.

Outlook is based upon certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, metal prices, oil prices, certain exchange rates and other assumptions. For example, revised 2023 Outlook assumes $1,900/oz Au, $3.50/lb Cu, $23.00/oz Ag, $1.15/lb Zn, $0.95/lb Pb, $0.70 AUD/USD exchange rate, $0.75 CAD/USD exchange rate and $80/barrel WTI. Production, CAS, AISC and capital estimates exclude projects that have not yet been approved, except for Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 which is included in Outlook. The potential impact on inventory valuation as a result of lower prices, input costs, and project decisions are not included as part of this Outlook. Assumptions used for purposes of Outlook may prove to be incorrect and actual results may differ from those anticipated, including variation beyond a +/-5% range. Outlook cannot be guaranteed. As such, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon Outlook and forward-looking statements as there can be no assurance that the plans, assumptions or expectations upon which they are placed will occur. Amounts may not recalculate to totals due to rounding.

Attributable Free Cash Flow is  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities  after deducting net cash flows from operations attributable to noncontrolling interests less  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations  after deducting net cash flows from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests less  Additions to property, plant and mine development  after deducting property, plant and mine development attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company believes that Attributable Free Cash Flow is useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company's performance with its competitors. Although Attributable Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company's calculation of Attributable Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.   The presentation of non-GAAP Attributable Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to Net income attributable to Newmont stockholders as an indicator of the Company's performance, or as an alternative to  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities  as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company's definition of Attributable Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Attributable Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   The following tables set forth a reconciliation of Attributable Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to  Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities  , which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Attributable Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities  and  Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.

A reconciliation of the 2023 Gold AISC outlook to the 2023 Gold CAS outlook is provided below. The estimates in the table below are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.   2023 Outlook - Gold  (1)(2)   Outlook Estimate  (+/- 5%)   (in millions, except ounces and per ounce)   Cost Applicable to Sales  (3)(4)   $   5,350   Reclamation Costs  (5)    195   Advanced Projects & Exploration  (6)    175   General and Administrative  (7)    255   Other Expense    15   Treatment and Refining Costs    40   Sustaining Capital  (8)    1,300   Sustaining Finance Lease Payments    45   All-in Sustaining Costs   $   7,375   Ounces (000) Sold  (9)    5,300   All-in Sustaining Costs per Ounce   $   1,400   (1)    The reconciliation is provided for illustrative purposes in order to better describe management's estimates of the components of the calculation. Estimates for each component of the forward-looking All-in sustaining costs per ounce are independently calculated and, as a result, the total All-in sustaining costs and the All-in sustaining costs per ounce may not sum to the component ranges. While a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been provided for the 2023 AISC Gold Outlook on a consolidated basis, a reconciliation has not been provided on an individual site or project basis in reliance on Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K because such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts.   (2)    All values are presented on a consolidated basis for Newmont.   (3)    Excludes  Depreciation and amortization  and  Reclamation and remediation  .   (4)    Includes stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments.   (5)    Reclamation costs include operating accretion and amortization of asset retirement costs.   (6)    Advanced Project and Exploration excludes non-sustaining advanced projects and exploration.   (7)    Includes stock based compensation.   (8)    Excludes development capital expenditures, capitalized interest and change in accrued capital.   (9)    Consolidated production for Merian is presented on a total production basis for the mine site and excludes production from Pueblo Viejo.   Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio   Management uses net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company's operating performance, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA represents the ratio of the Company's debt, net of cash and cash equivalents and time deposits, to Adjusted EBITDA. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA measure is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that net debt to Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management's determination of the components of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted EBITDA as follows:    Three Months Ended    September 30, 2023    June 30, 2023    March 31, 2023    December 31, 2022           Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders   $   158     155     $   351     $   (1,477   )   Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests    5     —      12      19    Net loss (income) from discontinued operations    (1   )    (2   )     (12   )     (11   )   Equity loss (income) of affiliates    (3   )    (16   )     (25   )     (26   )   Income and mining tax expense (benefit)    73     163      213      112    Depreciation and amortization    480     486      461      571    Interest expense, net of capitalized interest    48     49      65      53    EBITDA    760     835      1,065      (759   )   EBITDA Adjustments:          Reclamation and remediation charges    104     (2   )     —      700    Change in fair value of investments    41     42      (41   )     (45   )   Newcrest transaction-related costs    16     21      —      —    Restructuring and severance    7     10      2      1    Impairment charges    2     4      4      1,317    (Gain) loss on asset and investment sales, net    2     —      (36   )     (61   )   Settlement costs    2     —      —      2    Pension settlements    —     —      —      7    COVID-19 specific costs    —     —      —      2    Other    (1   )    —      (4   )     (3   )   Adjusted EBITDA    933     910      990      1,161    12 month trailing Adjusted EBITDA   $   3,994                  Total Debt   $   5,575          Lease and other financing obligations    512          Less: Cash and cash equivalents    (3,190   )         Total net debt   $   2,897                  Net debt to adjusted EBITDA    0.7          Net average realized price per ounce/pound   Average realized price per ounce/ pound are non-GAAP financial measures. The measures are calculated by dividing the net consolidated gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc sales by the consolidated gold ounces, copper pounds, silver ounces, lead pounds and zinc pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Average realized price per ounce/ pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.   The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure:    Three Months Ended  September 30,    Nine Months Ended  September 30,    2023    2022    2023    2022   Consolidated gold sales, net   $   2,400     $   2,350    $   7,083    $   7,586   Consolidated copper sales, net    90      48     282     223   Consolidated silver sales, net    5      105     246     401   Consolidated lead sales, net    —      26     64     98   Consolidated zinc sales, net    (2   )     105     180     407   Total sales   $   2,493     $   2,634    $   7,855    $   8,715    Three Months Ended September 30, 2023    Gold    Copper    Silver    Lead    Zinc    (ounces)    (pounds)    (ounces)    (pounds)    (pounds)   Consolidated sales:  (1)            Gross before provisional pricing and streaming impact   $   2,411     $   93     $   2    $   —    $   (3   )   Provisional pricing mark-to-market    (5   )     —      3     —     2    Silver streaming amortization    —      —      —     —     —    Gross after provisional pricing and streaming impact    2,406      93      5     —     (1   )   Treatment and refining charges    (6   )     (3   )     —     —     (1   )   Net   $   2,400     $   90     $   5    $   —    $   (2   )   Consolidated ounces (thousands)/pounds (millions) sold    1,250      25      55     —     (2   )   Average realized price (per ounce/pound):  (1)(2)            Gross before provisional pricing and streaming impact   $   1,929     $   3.83     N.M.

In our GAAP Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the value of these by-products is recorded as a credit to our CAS and the value of the primary ore is recorded as Sales. In certain instances, copper, silver, lead and zinc are co-products, or a significant resource in the primary ore-body, and the revenue is recorded as Sales in our GAAP Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   Gold by-product metrics are non-GAAP financial measures that serve as a basis for comparing the Company's performance with certain competitors. As Newmont's operations are primarily focused on gold production, "Gold by-product metrics" were developed to allow investors to view Sales, CAS per ounce and AISC per ounce calculations that classify all copper, silver, lead and zinc production as a by-product, even when copper, silver, lead or zinc is a significant resource in the primary ore-body. These metrics are calculated by subtracting copper, silver, lead and zinc sales recognized from Sales and including these amounts as offsets to CAS.   Gold by-product metrics are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. These metrics are intended to provide supplemental information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks, such as in IFRS.   The following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:    Three Months Ended  September 30,    Nine Months Ended  September 30,    2023    2022    2023    2022   Consolidated gold sales, net   $   2,400     $   2,350     $   7,083     $   7,586    Consolidated other metal sales, net    93      284      772      1,129    Sales   $   2,493     $   2,634     $   7,855     $   8,715            Costs applicable to sales   $   1,371     $   1,545     $   4,396     $   4,688    Less: Consolidated other metal sales, net    (93   )     (284   )     (772   )     (1,129   )   By-product costs applicable to sales   $   1,278     $   1,261     $   3,624     $   3,559    Gold sold (thousand ounces)    1,250      1,391      3,669      4,202    Total Gold CAS per ounce (by-product)  (1)   $   1,022     $   907     $   988     $   847            Total AISC   $   1,927     $   2,048     $   6,096     $   6,139    Less: Consolidated other metal sales, net    (93   )     (284   )     (772   )     (1,129   )   By-product AISC   $   1,834     $   1,764     $   5,324     $   5,010    Gold sold (thousand ounces)    1,250      1,391      3,669      4,202    Total Gold AISC per ounce (by-product)  (1)   $   1,467     $   1,268     $   1,451     $   1,192    (1)   Per ounce/pound measures may not recalculate due to rounding.​   Conference Call Information   A conference call will be held on  Thursday, October 26, 2023  at  10:00 a.m. Eastern Time  (8:00 a.m. Mountain Time); it will also be carried on the Company's website.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements, Including Outlook Assumptions:   This news release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws and "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable Australian securities laws. Where a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition; and often contain words such as "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "will," "would," "estimate," "expect," "believe," "pending" or "potential." Forward-looking statements in this news release may include, without limitation, (i) estimates of future production and sales, including production outlook, average future production and upside potential; (ii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales and all-in sustaining costs; (iii) estimates of future capital expenditures, including development and sustaining capital; (iv) expectations regarding the Tanami Expansion 2, Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides, Pamour and Cerro Negro District Expansion 1 projects, including, without limitation, expectations for production, milling, costs applicable to sales and all-in sustaining costs, capital costs, mine life extension, construction completion, commercial production, and other timelines; (v) future expectations regarding sites with recently restarted operations, including Peñasquito; (vi) expectations regarding future investments or divestitures; (vii) expectations regarding free cash flow and returns to stockholders, including with respect to future dividends, the dividend framework and expected payout levels; (viii) expectations regarding future mineralization, including, without limitation, expectations regarding reserves and recoveries; (ix) other outlook; and (x) expectations regarding pending or proposed transactions, including statements relating to the pending acquisition of Newcrest, such as the expected timing and implementation of the pending transaction and satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of operations and projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (iii) political developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) certain exchange rate assumptions; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, copper, silver, zinc, lead and oil; (vi) prices for key supplies; (vii) the accuracy of current mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates; and (viii) other planning assumptions. Uncertainties include those relating to general macroeconomic uncertainty and changing market conditions, changing restrictions on the mining industry in the jurisdictions in which we operate, impacts to supply chain, including price, availability of goods, ability to receive supplies and fuel, and impacts of changes in interest rates. Such uncertainties could result in operating sites being placed into care and maintenance and impact estimates, costs and timing of projects. Uncertainties in geopolitical conditions could impact certain planning assumptions, including, but not limited to commodity and currency prices, costs and supply chain availabilities. Investors are reminded that the dividend framework is non-binding and the 2023 dividend payout range does not represent a legal commitment. Future dividends beyond the dividend payable on December 22, 2023 to holders of record at the close of business on November 30, 2023 have not yet been approved or declared by the Board of Directors, and an annualized dividend payout or dividend yield has not been declared by the Board. Management's expectations with respect to future dividends are "forward-looking statements" and the Company's dividend framework is non-binding. The declaration and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be determined based on Newmont's financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, gold and commodity prices, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Risks relating to forward-looking statements in regard to the pending acquisition of Newcrest and the combined company may include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in company stock price and results of operations; the prompt and effective integration of Newmont's and Newcrest's businesses and the ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and value-creation contemplated by the pending transaction; the risk associated with the timing of the implementation of the pending transaction, including the risk that the pending transaction fails to be implemented for any reason; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against the parties and others related to the scheme implementation deed dated May 15, 2023, as amended from time to time (the "Scheme Implementation Deed"); unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the pending transaction, the response of business partners and retention as a result of the announcement and pendency of the transaction; risks relating to the value of the scheme consideration to be issued in connection with the pending transaction; the anticipated size of the markets and continued demand for Newmont's and Newcrest's resources and the impact of competitive responses to the announcement of the transaction; and the diversion of management time on pending transaction-related issues. For a more detailed discussion of such risks, see the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 23, 2023, as updated by the current report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on July 20, 2023, as well as Newmont's other SEC filings, including the definitive proxy statement, filed with the SEC on September 5, 2023, under the heading "Risk Factors", and other factors identified in the Company's reports filed with the SEC, available on the SEC website or  www.newmont.com  . The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any "forward-looking statement," including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued "forward-looking statement" constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on "forward-looking statements" is at investors' own risk.   Notice Regarding Reserve and Resource Estimates:   Unless otherwise stated herein, the reserves stated in this release represent estimates at December 31, 2022, which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on metal prices and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. Additionally, resource does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company's standards. Estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resource are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into reserves. For additional information on our reserves and resources, please see Item 2 of the Company's Form 10-K, filed on February 23, 2023 with the SEC, as updated by the current report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on July 20, 2023.

(TSXV:LSX) has launched its campaign on the Investing News Network’s resource channel. LaSalle Exploration is a diverse resource exploration and development company focused on projects in the province of Quebec. The company is working to evaluate both the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region and under-explored regions of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. The company owns a strong portfolio of projects including the Radisson gold property, the Blakelock gold-copper property and its recently-acquired Egan gold property.     Precipitate Gold Corp. (TSXV:PRG) has launched its campaign on the Investing News Network’s resource channel. Precipitate Gold is a mineral exploration company with district-scale strategic land positions in the Dominican Republic. The company is currently advancing its Pueblo Grande and Juan de Herrera projects in the Dominican Republic, where the company is also working to expand its existing portfolio. Precipitate Gold always works to acquire 100 percent of the properties that it owns, ensuring that there are no outstanding vendor payments or working commitments.     White Gold Corp. (TSXV:WGO,OTC:WHGOF,FRA:29W) has been featured in a sponsored article published by the Mining Journal. The article covered recent results from White Gold’s 2019 exploration program which is comprised of 17,000 meters of diamond drilling, 7,500 meters of reverse circulation drilling and upcoming drill plans. To date, White Gold has identified multiple new high-grade mineralization trends across its JP Ross project and White Gold project in the Yukon’s White Gold district. The new trends were all delineated within 10 kilometers away from last year’s Vertigo discovery area. One of White Gold’s goals this summer is to add more ounces to the VG zone on the company’s QV project, which sits 44 kilometers north of Newmont Goldcorp’s (TSX:NGT,NYSE:NEM) Coffee project.     As previously advised, Golden Mile Resources Limited (“Golden Mile”; “the Company”; ASX: “G88”) has been undertaking a detailed review of all projects in its current portfolio. As a part of this strategic review, the Company has now completed its detailed technical assessment of the Marble Bar and Murchison Projects.             Don Durrett of GoldStockData.com weighed in on the recent market meltdown, saying he sees it as another indicator that the US economy is in trouble and heading toward a recession as the year continues.  "I think that we're going to see kind of like a 2008 scenario where you start seeing big events," he explained.  "We had a couple banks go bad, but we haven't had a really big bankruptcy (like a) Lehman or a Bear Stearns event. And I think those are coming — I think Q4 is going to be very, very negative for the markets and better for gold and silver."        Victoria Gold (TSXV:VGCX,OTC Pink:VITFF), the owner of the Yukon-based Eagle gold mine, has been placed into receivership after the collapse of a heap leach pad at the site in June.  The company said on Wednesday (August 14) that the Yukon government had made a receivership application to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, and the court granted the application later that day.  According to the Globe and Mail, the Yukon is looking to exert greater control over cleanup and impact mitigation efforts after the heap leach pad incident, which has raised questions about the future of mining in the territory.               Westgold Resources (ASX:WGX,TSX:WGX,OTCQX:WGXRF) released a maiden ore reserve statement for its South Junction mine, part of the Bluebird - South Junction mining complex, on Wednesday (August 14).
