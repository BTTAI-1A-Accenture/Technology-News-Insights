So let's start with the positive: Wind-blown tree pollen is a good thing (environmentally speaking) because it's how trees − obviously incapable of uprooting and moving themselves − manage to fertilize other trees. Now let's move to the negative: That pollen drifts for miles and miles on the spring breezes here in the Evansville area, and it seems to end up in the human body just as much as it does on the oak trees in your yard. So along with a healthy stock of trees, you also get itchy eyes, a runny nose and the sort of congestion that makes you wonder if an elephant has stepped on your face. Here's how you can check on allergy levels in the area, and how you can find relief. Both The Weather Channel and Accuweather websites and apps offer quick, easy access to allergy forecasts. The Weather Channel offers a 15-day allergy forecast that, right now in the Evansville area, sees the level bounce between "moderate" and "very high." It also breaks down the pollen levels by the grass, tree and ragweed forms. The Accuweather forecast offers the by-allergen breakdowns, but also includes a "dust and dander" metric, which it notes as "high" this week. The website Pollen.com also boasts an easy-to-read map of allergy levels for the entire country. Around here, one allergy issue gives way to another one, unfortunately. By the time tree and then grass pollen levels settle down in June, weed pollen will ramp up and extend allergy season through summer and well into fall.  And if this all seems like it's worse than it used to be, scientists say it is. Rising carbon dioxide levels are contributing to rising temperatures, leading to longer growing seasons. Climate Central, a nonprofit science and news organization based in New Jersey, says the growing seasons are being lengthened by more than two weeks compared to the historical average since 1970. More growing means more pollen. The Mayo Clinic lists a bevy of suggestions for lessening pollen's impact.
