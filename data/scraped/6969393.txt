The U.S. grocery store segment is dominated by three primary national chains, with each having subsidiary franchises that address potential customers based on income, location, shopping purpose and even whether the shopper has children. Ahold Delhaize, The Kroger Co., and Albertsons Companies are the top three, with Albertsons and Kroger soon to merge. Those three names aren't typically what you find on the signage of your local grocery store, however. The three other brands specialize and stand out when serving certain demographics, as reported by Placer.ai.
