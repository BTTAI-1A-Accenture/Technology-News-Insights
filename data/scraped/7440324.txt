Sign In Register The Moose Jaw Winmar Warriors have had a handful of games this season where third period struggles proved to be their undoing. The shoe was on the other foot on Saturday afternoon. The Warriors scored a pair of goals in the final frame to overcome a two-goal deficit before scoring the winner in overtime and taking a 5-4 victory over the Prince Albert Mintos in Sask Male AAA Hockey League action at the Moose Jaw Events Centre. Moose Jaw captain Ryder Knutson played the hero on the game’s two biggest goals, first scoring the tying marker on the power play with 9:20 to go in regulation and then finishing things off with another marker on the man advantage 3:10 into the extra frame. It was an impressive turn of events for the Warriors, who picked up their first win of the new year and improved to 11-13-0-4 on the campaign. That moves Moose Jaw into a tie for seventh place with the Mintos, two points back of Warman for sixth. Logan Pickford scored the lone goal of the opening period for Prince Albert, setting the stage for a goal-fest in the second. Connor Miller tied the game 27 seconds in, Abinet Klassen gave P.A. a 2-1 lead at 12:52 and Liam Fitzpatrick tied the contest again two minutes later. That was the last of the good news in the period for the Warriors, though, as Roper Blanchard and Kelan Simmonds scored in the final 3:27 to give the Mintos their 4-2 lead heading into the final frame. Bryce Boughen and Grady Hoffman had two assists each for the Warriors, while Knutson finished with three points. Ryan Hicks settled down after a bit of a rough stretch in the second period, finishing the game with 13 saves and the win for Moose Jaw. The Warriors had 51 shots on Jayden Kraus at the other end of the ice, including 20 in the second period alone. The Winmar Warriors are back in action on Sunday evening when they travel to Saskatoon to face the Contacts. Game time is 4:30 p.m. © 2024 MooseJawToday.com
