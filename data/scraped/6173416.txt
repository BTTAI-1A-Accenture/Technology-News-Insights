While we didnât have the space to include everything for backpacking, car camping, or RV life, we did our best to include a variety of items that youâd use for some or all of those activities. Most of the gear included is also featured in other gear roundups and is ranked as the âbest overallâ for that specific category.Â  Since this article includes a wide range of gear, we selected equipment based on previous product testing and gear picks made by Field and Stream writers and editors. When choosing the best camping gear, durability, functionality, and sustainability are considered. Products are subject to change as more product testing is conducted and additional products enter the market, so check back for our most up-to-date recommendations.Â  Finding the best tent or camping shelter depends on intended use, climate, and personal preference. A tight budget can interfere with investing in specific tents that may have the highest functionality and performance. In our many more in-depth tent reviews, we always include a budget pick among our other categories. Regardless of the intended use or frequency of use, a few things always remain: your tent needs to be suitable for the weather conditions, easy to set up, made from durable materials, and has enough room for gear along with a comfortable sleeping space.

It can seem overwhelming to build a camp gear setup from zero. The good news is that you donât need to buy everything at once, and you donât need to buy everything new. Several used gear retailers offer better prices on gently used gear. Renting is also an option if you donât want to invest in equipment just yet.Â  The type of camping gear you need depends on the camping you enjoy. If youâre searching for tips and gear lists online, you may notice that some lists seem to include everything and the kitchen sink to get outside. The truth is, you donât need that much gear to enjoy camping, and once you have the essentials, you can start to add a few more things to make the experience more comfortable and personable.Â  As mentioned above, the type of camping youâre doing can influence the gear needed. For instance, many developed campgrounds have water fill-up stations and bathrooms available. For backpacking or boondocking, you may need to pack water or bring a filtration system to collect water as you go.Â  Camping Essentials Tent (+ footprint and stakes) Sleeping pad Sleeping bag Camping pillow Camp chairsÂ  Camp table (if no picnic table) Illumination (flashlights, lanterns, headlamp) Multi-tool Repair kit First aid kit Saw or axe Stove + fuelÂ  Cooking pots + pans Cooking and eating utensilsÂ  Plates, bowls, cups, and mugs Cutting board + knives Cooler + iceÂ  Water container + bottles Water filter (if there is no access to potable water) Camp sink + dishwashing items Trash/recycling bags or binsÂ  Matches or lighter To some campers, these items might be essential. In any case, consider bringing these for a higher level of comfort while camping. Other equipment like sleeping bag liners are seasonally dependent, and navigation tools may be necessary for backpacking but not camping in a campground.Â  Optional Camping Items Firewood (bought or collected near camp) Hammock Sunshade or screen house Tablecloth + clips/tape Camp rug Clothesline Mallet for tent stakesÂ  Broom + dustpanÂ  Cots Sleeping bag linerÂ  FirestarterÂ  Dry bags, stuff sacks, or storage containersÂ  Solar and portable powerÂ  If youâre camping with dogs, donât forget to bring equipment for them. For example, dogs benefit from sleeping on a pad; some breeds may need a sleeping bag or blanket to stay warm. Many campgrounds also require that dogs be on leashes, so setting up a runner in camp or having a long line to allow the dog to roam within camp may be necessary.Â  Although many of us may be camping on a lake to go fishing or in an area to hike, we may have downtime in camp. Depending on the activities you enjoy outdoors, consider what necessary gear-wise to do those things is.Â  Leisure Items Books or reading materialÂ  Puzzle books Cards or board gamesÂ  BinocularsÂ  Field guides (plants, birds, stars, etc.) JournalÂ  Art suppliesÂ  Games + toysÂ  Music player with headphones Guitar Playing music while in camp should only be considered if youâre relatively isolated from other campers; otherwise, you may disturb their experience. For more on outdoor etiquette, be sure to read up on the seven leave no trace principles . Q: What are the big 3 for camping? The big three for camping include your backpack, sleep system, and shelter. Theyâre called this because they are often the biggest and heaviest items necessary. Q: What is the golden rule of camping? The golden rule of camping, or any outdoor recreation, is to leave the area better than you found it. That generally means packing out everything you bring and picking up any trash you find along the way. Always follow leave no trace principles during camping ventures. Q: How do I organize camping gear? Having storage containers, bins, and bags to keep camping gear all in one place and make packing/unpacking a breeze is ideal. Our recommended storage container is theÂ Yeti LoadOut GoBox , especially since it is waterproof and can be bear-proofed with locks. Still, other clear plastic containers work just as well for organizational purposes and come at a lower cost. Q: Can I fly with camping gear? Yes, you can fly with most camping gear. Any gear that could be considered a weapon needs to be in checked luggage. Camp stoves can also be packed into checked bags as long as they do not contain any fuel or fuel vapors. Always consult your airlineâs restrictions and TSA packing guidelines to ensure you pack appropriately. Q: How do I clean my camping gear? Most camping gear items have specific cleaning needs, and consulting manufacturer guidelines for cleaning, care, and general maintenance is advised. Get more detailed information in our detailed guides on how to clean tents , wash backpacks , and flush water filters . The best camping gear is the gear that keeps you safe, dry and warm, and helps you enjoy y camping experience. Backpacking, car camping, RVing, spike camps, and overlanding all require some diversity in equipment, but several mainstays apply to all categories. If youâre just starting, it helps to get to know the type of camping you enjoy most so you can find the best camping gear for your specific needs. Having a friend or mentor that already has gear is a good way to see what may work for you. Renting camping equipment is also a great way to test out products if thatâs available in the area youâre camping. Lastly, consider buying used gear. Many large retailers like REI, North Face, and Patagonia offer used gear at a discounted price For more than 125 years, Field & Stream has been providing readers with honest and authentic coverage of outdoor gear. Our writers and editors eat, sleep, and breathe the outdoors, and that passion comes through in our product reviews. You can count on F&S to keep you up to date on the best new gear. And when we write about a productâwhether itâs a bass lure or a backpackâwe cover the good and the bad, so you know exactly what to expect before you decide to make a purchase.
