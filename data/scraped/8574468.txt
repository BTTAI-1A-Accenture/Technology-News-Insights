 Share this article Irish people spent 50% more on restaurants this year, according to banking app Revolut. The company’s spending habits review for 2022 shows that, after two years of turbulence for the hospitality industry customers came flooding back this year. The figures show that the average user spent 7% less on groceries this year compared to last – but 50% more in restaurants. The biggest increase in restaurant spend was among 65 to 74-year-olds, who spent 55.6% more, while the smallest was among 35 to 44-year-olds who spent 39.3% more.  While most users went big on takeaways during COVID, the vast majority cut back significantly this year. The only group that spent more on takeaways this year than last were the 18 to 24-year-olds, who increased their spending by 0.5%. Meanwhile, post-lockdown living saw people taking greater care of their appearance – with spending at barbers, hair salons, and beauticians up 17.7%. As COVID receded many people began to travel once again this year. Irish people spent money in an average of three countries this year, according to the app – a 23.4% increase. Meanwhile, the cost-of-living crisis did little to dampen people’s generosity with users donating millions to the likes of the Irish Red Cross, the Toy Show Appeal and the Irish Cancer Society. Revolut now has more than two million customers in Ireland and it seems more people are starting to save with the app – with the average user increasing their savings by 52%.
