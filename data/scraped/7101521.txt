IMAGINE a world where your dream home's construction is driven by the same technology that powers cryptocurrencies. Blockchain, when merged with powerhouses like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, goes beyond reshaping the realm of digital coins; it has the potential to revolutionize industries, changing how we perceive home construction. Though blockchain holds immense potential, it's still in its early stages and brings along uncertainty when combined with AI. To get a clearer understanding of these topics, I reached out to Kristoffer Dave Tabong, chief information officer at the homebuilding tech startup, Homeqube. With an extensive background in building design, management and construction, Tabong deepened his expertise during the pandemic by pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science. This education opened his eyes to how Artificial Intelligence can be harnessed for data-driven solutions in the construction world. Before joining Homeqube, he promoted digitalization at Multi-Development and Construction Corp. (MDCC), a task which he later continued at Homeqube under the invitation of its founder, Jose Paolo Calma, a construction sector expert and chief executive of Homeqube. Ad-free access
