Surveillance video obtained by TMZ has been released that appears to show Britney Spears hitting herself after the pop star's hand was pushed off the San Antonio Spurs' Victor Wembanyama. Spears claimed she was assaulted by security staff, but Las Vegas Police will not pursue criminal charges. Spears initially accused a member of the No. 1 pick's security team of backhanding her in the face when she approached him for a picture Wednesday night.

The person also noted that, after they were seated for dinner, the security guard came over to apologize.  But the incident report also noted that security footage showed the security guard pushing Spears’ "hand off of the player without looking which causes Britney's hand to hit herself in the face." The update from law enforcement follows Spears’ statement that she was assaulted by the Spurs’ security personnel.

His security then backhanded me in the face without looking back, in front of a crowd. Nearly knocking me down and causing my glasses off my face," Spears wrote in a statement published on her social media.  VICTOR WEMBANYAMA’S SECURITY WON'T FACE CHARGES FOR BRITNEY SPEARS SLAP, POLICE SAY "I get swarmed by people all the time.
