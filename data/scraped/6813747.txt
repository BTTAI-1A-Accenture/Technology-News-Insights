The staff member was left with a 'wound to his face' A shopkeeper in St Leonards, near Hastings, was left with a wound on his face that "required stitches" after being assaulted a few weeks ago (January 14) while working. Sussex Police are now appealing for witnesses after the incident at a shop on Kings Road. In their appeal, police want to speak to the suspect who the shopkeeper tried to stop from leaving the shop after suspected shoplifting. The same suspect assaulted the man before then going into a second shop on London Road, where he allegedly "racially abused" another shopkeeper who challenged the suspect for shoplifting. In their appeal for witnesses, police said the suspect was a "young man" thought to have been wearing "grey trousers, a grey top and a black hooded jumper".
