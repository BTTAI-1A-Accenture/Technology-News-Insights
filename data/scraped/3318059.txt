The man who drove through a Vatican City gate and kept going even after guards fired at his car was taken Friday to a nearby hospital for psychiatric care after a preliminary interrogation, the Vatican said. The man, who has not been identified by the Holy See, was taken to the Santo Spirito in Sassia psychiatric ward after spending the night in the Vatican police barracks. DRIVER APPREHENDED AFTER SPEEDING THROUGH VATICAN GATE, REACHING SAN DAMASO COURTYARD According to the Holy See, the man rushed the Santa Anna gate sometime after 8 p.m. Thursday, after the Swiss Guards initially refused him entry. He kept accelerating after Vatican gendarmes at an interior checkpoint fired at his tires, and ultimately stopped inside one of the courtyards of the Apostolic Palace. There, Vatican gendarmes arrested him, the Holy See statement said, adding that at the time he seemed in an agitated psychological state.

Given his condition, "he was taken to the psychiatric ward ... for obligatory treatment," the statement said.

The pope was believed to have been in the Santa Marta hotel at the time. The incident was a rare incursion into the city state, much of which is off limits to the general public, especially at night.
