With a break in stormy weather, people in the Santa Cruz Mountains rushed to clear roads and restore power ahead of evening rain, Thursday. About 2,000 people in the Zayante area are going on two weeks with no phone service and internet, according to the Zayante Fire Department. "We had a drive-up-medical today because a person needed to go to the hospital and they had no way to communicate but to drive to the fire station. Fortunately, they made it," Chief Dan Walters at the Zayante Fire Department said.  Those without a personal generator are also without power.   "Tempers are getting short, people are getting tiredâ€”starting to see freelancing with people coming out just to clear a road," Walters said.   According to Walters, the main focus on Thursday was keeping Zayante Road open so people could gather supplies in Felton and travel up to the top of Lompico.  Still, Walters says, up to 100 people are stranded in their homes.  Hanging power lines are forcing  people to shelter-in-place, and hazardous road conditions, like fallen trees, landslides and washed out roads, is making it difficult for Xfinity Comcast to try and restore service.  A private portion of Lompico Road remains washed out, stranding a community of 14 homes and making it difficult for residents to travel and buy supplies.   "I've got a truck so I drove from my home in Aptos and gave that to my dad who lives way up the road on the other side of the wash out so he'll have wheels on the outside to get food, fuel and supplies," Nole Mccord said.  According to Walters, many damaged roads are privately owned, which means homeowners will need to pool their money and pay for repairs without county support.
