The collapse of SVB rattled investors’ confidence, as they started pulling their assets and deposits out of the bank soon after the crisis. According to a report by Bloomberg, top executives at 15 banks lost $267 million in wealth in the span of days following the collapse. The rippling effects of this fallout were felt in Europe as well. As investors registered their fears regarding the fallout, President Biden assured the nation of the banking system’s safety. He announced that investors will have access to their deposits whenever they need. In a joint statement, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg also attempted to boost investor confidence by offering loans to banks for up to one year. Here are some comments from the Fed: “This action will bolster the capacity of the banking system to safeguard deposits and ensure the ongoing provision of money and credit to the economy. The Federal Reserve is prepared to address any liquidity pressures that may arise.” Despite government intervention, bank stocks continue to fall in value. The S&P Banks Select Industry Index declined by 12.88% in the past five days, compared with a 2.28% return of the S&P 500. Considering this slump in the banking sector, wealth advisors recommend putting money across different asset classes. Patrick Dwyer, managing director at NewEdge Wealth, spoke to CNBC about possible investment strategies to follow. He asserted that investors should put money into Treasuries and money markets as they can offer around 5% risk-free return during elevated interest rate periods. Similarly, Michael Zeuner, managing partner at WE Family Offices, also highlighted the importance of cash in this environment. He mentioned: “For so many years, cash was just not an interesting investment. It was paying zero, so people weren’t really paying attention to cash. Over the last year, as rates came up, and as the fear of a recession kicked in, a lot of families started to take some risk off the table. It went into cash. And so cash, from an investment perspective, [has] all of a sudden become a much more important part of the portfolio.” During such economic environments, the main focus of investors is to generate stable and regular income. Investing in dividend stocks is one of the best ways to achieve this goal as these companies reward investors with monthly, quarterly, or annual payouts. Keeping in mind the current situation of the banking sector, we will discuss the best bank dividend stocks in this article. Some of these companies include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC).
