 Looking at the big, broad corporate structures we work in, we tend to overlook the simplest of things, the things, that at times make the entire difference. The phrase ‘ignorance is bliss’ is not universal and does not apply to all cases. Being prudent is a crucial function for making informed decisions, mitigating risks, and ensuring long-term well-being and success. Prudence levels differ from one person to another, based on their curiosity, observation levels, characteristics and functionality quotient. Prudence is also directly proportional to the level of importance of one’s contribution in personal and professional life.  We, as lawyers and advisors, are taught that ignorance of the law is never a valid defence. Then we tend to get creative in finding a valid defence. But at times, we too forget that individual prudence levels though important to be adopted, the end beneficiary or the ultimate loser of the actions may not be borne by the individual himself.  Individuals with busy lives, incline to follow the ‘no-one told me’ approach, which at the end of the day is not beneficial for any party involved. This approach is available when information has been transferred orally, by following the ‘society-aunty’ method. The mindset to be changed from ‘selective prudence’ to ‘participative prudence’ is an effort-motivated power of the individual themselves. It can at times be environmental too. We in all sectors of work, know and understand the importance of the written word, however, for ease in communication we take up oral over written, always. Legally sound people, or those who have watched a lot of criminal shows, know that proofs and an alibi are important. Yes, it is important, even in real day-to-day life, from the daily grocery list which my mother conveniently posts on our family WhatsApp group, so the blame and responsibility of it easily pass to the person, to whom it is addressed. But one should learn from my Papa, the creative use of defences, which takes time to perfect. With great power, comes responsibility, and along with it comes mindfulness- this should be a clear and implied by-product. However, this manufacturing process evolves from the understanding that negligence is not acceptable and that diligent care and attention must be given at every stage. Negligence may sound far-fetched, but a conditional liability, anyway, does take place. One is always held accountable for what one brings to the plate.  The absence of comprehensive and tailored practices, under this behavioural science in the context of People’s Prudence, poses significant challenges. These gaps arise due to underlying thresholds in the internal risk parameters of each individual.  A prudent policy, personal to you, plays a vital role in your success and at times sustainability in relationships, society and workplaces. One unchecked attachment to an email can make people lose confidence in you.  One always has to navigate through the complex landscapes one faces, address outcomes one needs and then fulfil the obligation to maintain trust.  While prudence relates to human behaviour, it does also have legal implications. In jurisprudence, where we often explore the intersection between laws and ethics, morality and human behaviour. Prudence is considered a crucial virtue within Natural Law theory. Practical wisdom or practical reasons are necessary for taking moral decisions.  Prudence acts as a guide for individuals for interpreting natural law and thereby applying it to the required legal situations, thus, aligning legal actions with and reflecting moral principles of natural law.  This implies an individual’s prudence is maintained by the Natural Law theory through understanding the relationship between law and morality. However, it is important to note, that this philosophy of prudence for moral reasoning, apt legal decisions and societal progress, is supported by not only the Natural Law theory but also Legal Positivism, Legal Realism and even feminist Jurisprudence.  As stated by Aristotle, ‘Virtue is not merely a state in conformity with the Right Principle, but the one that implies the Right Principle; and the Right Principle in moral conduct is Prudence.” Aristotle supported the Natural Law theory, he believed that individuals should follow natural law to achieve eudemonia. This implies that in the domain of moral conduct, the foundational principle is prudence, which serves as the basis for sound judgment and decision-making ensuring thoughtful and vigilant deliberation in all facets of life.   Manager - Secretarial at Bajaj Finserv Very well written article Sarbani Tej Puri !
