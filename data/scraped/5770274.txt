                             Heriot-Watt University Malaysia (HWUM) reaffirms its commitment to expanding educational opportunities with the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with Experian Malaysia, a prominent global information services company on 7 September 2023. The partnership formalises the establishment of the âExperian â Heriot-Watt Leaders with Impact Scholarship Awardâ, a part of HWUMâs â1821 Appeal â Leaders with Impact Scholarshipâ, a programme designed to support gifted students from underserved communities in Malaysia and empower them to pursue quality education in the United Kingdom (UK). Aligned with the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP), this groundbreaking scholarship initiative, fortified by an unwavering commitment to comprehensive pastoral care, is deeply entrenched in its mission to empower the brightest young minds hailing from Malaysiaâs disadvantaged backgrounds. Its resounding goal is to equip these promising individuals with the essential tools required to embark on a transformative educational journey in the UK. This initiative does not merely aim to open doors to education; it strives to level the educational playing field, fostering an environment where merit and potential, rather than financial circumstances, determine oneâs destiny. It is a beacon of hope, radiating the promise of a positive global transformation. In a resounding display of inclusivity and meritocracy, the scholarship initiative warmly embraces exceptionally gifted individuals from the Bottom 40 percent (B40) of Malaysian households, individuals who have exhibited remarkable excellence in their Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia, and Unified Education Certification examinations. These scholars, brimming with untapped potential, represent the very embodiment of resilience and academic brilliance. The scholarship initiative primarily supports students beginning their foundational studies within HWUMâs Business programme, setting them on a path toward undergraduate degrees in Actuarial Science or Data Science. Recipients will benefit from comprehensive coverage that includes tuition fees and essential cost-of-living expenses over four years. Professor Mushtak Al-Atabi, Provost and Chief Executive Officer of HWUM, expressed his pride in partnering with organisations that share the mission of widening access to education, saying, âOver the next decade, HWUM has set its sights on a noble objective: to bestow the gift of education upon a minimum of ten deserving students every year. This ambitious commitment is made possible through strategic collaborations with leading Malaysian and global corporations, who share HWUMâs unshakable belief in the power of education to uplift individuals and propel them towards making a profound impact on the world. This isnât just about scholarships; itâs about forging pathways to success, enabling promising talents to fulfil their destinies, and contributing to a brighter future for all. âWe are fortunate that since the launch of the â1821 Appeal â Leaders with Impact Scholarshipâ last year, more organisations have joined the programme, providing opportunities for exceptionally gifted individuals from underserved families who aspire to pursue higher education and make a positive impact on the world.â Experian Malaysia emphasised their commitment to this partnership, underscoring its dedication to supporting educational initiatives that empower students from diverse backgrounds: âPartnering with government agencies and universities is the blueprint for crafting a future-ready talent pipeline in Malaysia. Collective wisdom, research, and policy unite to empower individuals with the skills needed to navigate the challenges of tomorrow's world. It is evident that career paths across a broad spectrum, from finance to marketing, now require an element of data engineering expertise. Demand for 'data professionals' has tripled in the last five years alone and new job opportunities like design ethicist and product philosopher are on the rise. Despite this trend, there are still barriers and being in the business of data, Experian Malaysia will continue to invest and work towards creating a workforce that will drive innovation, economic growth, and societal progress for Malaysia In 2022, eight deserving students received the scholarship, and an additional ten students are set to benefit this year through partnerships with organisations, including FWD Takaful. The MoA signing ceremony was attended by Professor Mushtak Al-Atabi; HWUM Chief Operating Officer & Registrar Janice Yew; Experian Malaysia Site Leader and Human Resources Director Chua Chai Ping; and Experian Malaysia Talent Acquisition Manager Crystine Yoong. © Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh, ScotlandUK EH14 4AS+44 131 449 5111 Scottish registered charity numberSC000278
