Funded by NSERC grants, the work with researchers from the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo focuses on key hardware advancements for quantum computing systems
 BURNABY, British Columbia & PALO ALTO, Calif. & WATERLOO, Ontario--(BUSINESS WIRE)--D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS), a leader in quantum computing systems, software, and services and the world’s first commercial supplier of quantum computers, today announced two new collaborations with the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the University of Waterloo. These collaborations establish key hardware research programs for quantum computing systems.

  
The two multi-year projects between D-Wave and the researchers were funded through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Quantum Alliance program, which is part of Canada’s National Quantum Strategy. These projects will focus on identifying improvements in device design and materials quality that support increasingly coherent superconducting quantum processors.

 
“Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize how we tackle societal problems. Key to this transformation is the ability to provide larger quantum systems with greater coherence, and these NSERC projects each facilitate important R&D for these next-generation systems,” said Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave. “We’re excited to engage with the University of Waterloo through the NSERC program to further build out a robust quantum ecosystem that can tackle real-world problems.”

 
"The collaboration with D-Wave will provide a unique opportunity to explore fundamental aspects of the physics of a new generation of superconducting qubits, which have the potential to enable new quantum computing architectures,” said Dr. Adrian Lupascu, professor at the Institute for Quantum Computing and Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo.

 
“I would like to thank NSERC for the opportunity to collaborate with D-Wave. These funds provide essential support for my research team to work with D-Wave on developing improved superconducting components for quantum computing and quantum devices. In addition, the collaboration will contribute to building up Canada’s quantum-ready workforce, as my team gains valuable experience in the fast-growing cryogenic and quantum computing sector,” said Dr. Jan Kycia, Physics and Astronomy professor at the University of Waterloo and Institute for Quantum Computing affiliate.
