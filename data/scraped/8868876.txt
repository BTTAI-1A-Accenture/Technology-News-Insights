    FUKUYAMA, Hiroshima -- Kindergarteners here on June 9 got to see a some 400-year-old hourglass said to have been sent from Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shogun of the Edo period (1603-1867), to his cousin Mizuno Katsunari, the first feudal lord of the Fukuyama domain (now part of Hiroshima Prefecture).
 
    The sand clock, measuring approximately 21 centimeters tall and 10 centimeters wide, has been kept at Kenchuji temple here, which was Katsunari's family temple. The hourglass frame is a wooden hexagon covered with leather decorated with a gold arabesque pattern. It is believed to have been made in the Netherlands roughly four centuries ago, and can still measure about 100 minutes.
 
    The clock is not often on public display, but is shown annually to children at local Kanariya Kindergarten to mark Japan's "anniversary of time" on June 10. 
 
    The temple's chief priest Kakuzen Mizuno told the children, "Time is invisible, but it is important. Please make sure go to bed early and get up early and prepare to go to kindergarten while appreciating time."
 
    Ena Ota, 5, said, "I will do my best to go to bed early and get up early every day."
