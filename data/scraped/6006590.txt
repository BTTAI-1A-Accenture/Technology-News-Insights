(CBS12) â€” The State of Florida is set to receive over $3 million from a nearly $50 million, multistate action over a data breach into an international software company that potentially exposed millions. According to the office of Attorney General Ashley Moody news release, the "massive" ransomware attack on Blackbaud happened in 2020, compromising the personal information of consumers across the country, like Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial information, employment information, donation history and health information. Due to the action led by the Florida AG with 48 other states and the District of Columbia, the company must overhaul its data security. "We are holding Blackbaud, an international software company, accountable for a massive ransomware attack that compromised the personal information of potentially millions of consumers across the country, including those donating to charities, health care organizations and other nonprofits," Moody said in the news release.
