Mega Millions is one of six lottery games in North Carolina where players have the option of buying their tickets at a retail location or with Online Play through the lottery’s website or with the NC Lottery Official Mobile App. Ticket sales from draw games like Mega Millions make it possible for the lottery to raise $2.5 million a day on average for education.
