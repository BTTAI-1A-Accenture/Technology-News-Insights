             My incredible undergrad students have achieved a remarkable feat by securing second place at the 6th Annual Research Meet. Their presentation on the groundbreaking concept of an in-pipe turbine left the audience in awe. It's an absolutely stunning accomplishment that fills me with immense delight!
They integrated state-of-the-art technologies such as 3D printing and CFD analysis. Prime Minister Research Fellow (PMRF) - Geomatics ,Civil engineering- IIT Jammu Congratulations

             Understanding the coorporate culture is the most fundamental knowledge for someone to join a coorporate to hit the ground running. 
Suscessfully competed a course on Power BI. Gone are the days of compiling 100s of excel spreadsheets, neverending references for the purpose of summary, tiring process of pivoting tables and sleepless nights to create visualization. Oh God, if that had to be updated. Not over yet!  long hours of preparing presentations. PowerBI does all of those with just a few  clicks. Oh, not to forget, those days of sending emails back and forth, at times forgetting which copy was the latest.
Power BI got everything covered.

             I want to share an update on our recent initiative, where we embarked on a new journey of guiding students through field data collection. Check out the details in my latest post: [https://lnkd.in/gSaSUxMi?]. Additionally, I've included an animation illustrating the process of collecting velocity and bathymetry data. #WaterResourceEngineering #MakingLearningFun

             Celebrating 13+ Years at CST and Embarking on New Leadership

As I celebrate 13+ years at CST today, I am thrilled to share that I will be leading the water resource engineering programme and laying out a rigid foundation. 

These 13 years have been an incredible odyssey of learning, growth, and collaboration, starting as an assistant lecturer and now spearheading the department. All the previous HoDs have played a pivotal role in bringing up the institute as it stands today. Especially the heads of Civil Department for incubating and nurturing many programmes¬†including the Architecture department, which initially flourished under the umbrella of Civil Engineering before establishing itself as a separate department. Today, the civil engineering department is housing and nurturing Engineering Geology and Water Resource engineering programmes.

This momentous occasion would be incomplete without expressing my heartfelt gratitude to the extraordinary members of the Civil Engineering department. Their unwavering trust and unwavering belief in my abilities have been the driving force behind my success.

             Extending learning teaching beyond a classroom provides an enriching experiences for  students and faculty alike. With the introduction of new programme on water resource engineering, CST is embracing towards skill based learning. This pedagogy shift embarks on learning teaching process not just limited within a classroom but providing  opportunities for hands-on learning. 

This semester we included practicals on EVE301 Hydrology where students conduct the experiment on the natural channel. I strongly believe this would help to bridge any gaps that exist in the theories learnt and its actual application in the real world. 

Yesterday (7th Nov, 2023), Mr Christian Hass, whom I met during one of the training related to EFlow, provided a guest lecture to the students which further reinforced their learning. 

This endeavour has been greatly supported by NEC (National Environmental Commission) with the financial support from üá¶üáπ üá¶üáπ Austrian Development Cooperation through a project on EFlow.  

At CST, we are committed in  preparing tomorrow's best technologist

             Just a few weeks ago, we witnessed a catastrophic flood in Sikkim. Today, there is yet another sobering news: the mighty Thorthomi Lake ruptured this evening around 7:20 PM, sending a massive volume of moraine debris towards the Punakha Valley.

Just today, students undertaking a hydrology module presented the application of flood routing as a measure for flood preparedness. Tonight, we are faced with a real-world situation.

Climate change is a real threat, and its consequences are slapping us in the face. Unfortunately, those countries that contribute the least to greenhouse gases are the ones that will be impacted the most.
