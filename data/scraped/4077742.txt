     Theoretical physicist Dr. Michio Kaku explains the significance of new images provided by NASA's Webb Space Telescope on 'Sunday Night in America.' While questions about the universe abound, a James Webb Space Telescope image has recently raised others.  The telescope's high-resolution Near-Infrared Camera snapshot of a pair of forming young stars also caught what appears to be a cosmic question mark toward the bottom right.  The stars, captured in near-infrared light, are known as Herbig-Haro 46/47 and are buried in a disk of gas and dust.  Located just 1,470 light-years from Earth in the Vela Constellation, the object is just a few thousand years old. Over millions of years, NASA says, the stars will fully form. WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE CAPTURES STUNNING SHOTS OF RING NEBULA NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has captured a tightly bound pair of actively forming stars, known as Herbig-Haro 46/47, in high-resolution near-infrared light. Look for them at the center of the red diffraction spikes, appearing as an orange-white splotch. (NASA, ESA, CSA. Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale (STScI)) The space agencies working on the telescope explain that, in the background of the shot, lie extremely distant galaxies.  "Blue objects with diffraction spikes are stars, and the closer they are, the larger they appear. White-and-pink spiral galaxies sometimes appear larger than these stars, but are significantly farther away. The tiniest red dots, Webb’s infrared specialty, are often the oldest, most distant galaxies," the European Space Agency noted.

"Additional follow-up would be required to figure out what it is with any certainty. Webb is showing us many new, distant galaxies – so there's a lot of new science to be done!" Matt Caplan, an assistant professor of physics at Illinois State University, also told Space.com that the object might be two galaxies merging – although noting that there are plenty of additional possibilities.  Julia Musto is a reporter for Fox News and Fox Business Digital.  Stay up-to-date on the latest AI technology advancements and learn about the challenges and opportunities AI  By entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and
