She is the first to support the health system's caregivers There's a new facility dog at Penn State Health's Children's Hospital in Hershey. Skye is a one-and-a-half-year-old golden retriever. May 3 is her third day on the job, where she will work 40 hours a week. She will also work with two chaplains who are assigned to support staff. Her primary role will be to help the mental and emotional health of staff. "It's important for our caregivers to remember that they're human too. They need to take a break, and they need to stop and smile and let their heart rate down. Let them take care of themselves, and she is a great friend and employee to help us help them do that," staff chaplain Kelly Fuddy said. "Every time we round that corner with Skye, faces light up, and people get really excited to run over and talk to her," staff chaplain Laura Ramsey said. Skye is the fourth facility dog but the first to support the health system's caregivers. More facility dogs are coming in the future.
