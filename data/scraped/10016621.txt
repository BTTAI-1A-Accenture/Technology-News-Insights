Major Ho Thanh Hoa, 38, former deputy police chief of Tan Thanh B Commune, Tan Hong District, was detained by the provincial police for "voluntary manslaughter in performance of official duties." Hoa and three other police officers had come to the house of Tran Van Dam, 57, on Aug. 28 to take him to the commune's police station after he was reported to be drunk and disrupting public order. Dam reportedly screamed and cursed at the officers at the station. Authorities said Hoa became angry and kicked Dam before leaving. Around 10 minutes later, Hoa found that Dam was unconscious, weakly breathing and convulsing, so he took him to a local medical station. But Dam died later. Hoa has been removed from the police force.
