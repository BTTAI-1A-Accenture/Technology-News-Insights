Management CommentaryEddie Lehner, Ryerson's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "First, let's take stock of all that was accomplished at Ryerson in 2022. Gratitude and thanks all around to our customers, my Ryerson teammates, and our suppliers as we skillfully navigated a tumultuous, but nonetheless one of our best years on record. The full year highlights articulated in this release reflect a better path we have set ourselves on given the level of investment in the business through capex and business development during the year while returning approximately $70 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  Speaking of dividends, we announced our sixth consecutive quarterly dividend increase to 17 cents per share given our confidence in Ryerson's future trajectory and secular strengths underpinning demand for recyclable and reusable industrial metals. During the fourth quarter, we saw margin compression peak around mid-quarter and then inflect positively through year-end while shipments and revenues were within our guided range. Though we experienced some transient counter-cyclical dynamics around carbon program price resets and elevated industry-wide stainless inventory levels that amplified margin compression in the quarter, these effects were a segue to improving industry conditions moving through the back-half of the fourth quarter and into early 2023.  We are encouraged by price, margin and demand support seen through the midpoint of the first quarter of 2023. Despite elevated levels of economic uncertainty engendered by inflation, macro-policy, and geo-political risks, demand and industrial metal commodity price support appear resilient given current levels of business investment, consumer spending, reshoring trends, expectant industrial metals demand in India and China as well as fiscal policy support for infrastructure, chip manufacturing and climate-related investment." 2022 Company Highlights: Fourth Quarter ResultsRyerson generated net sales of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 16.5% compared to $1.5 billion for the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by seasonally lower volumes and lower selling prices. Volumes declined 9.2% and average selling prices declined 8.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2022 in line with our guidance. Gross margin contracted sequentially by 490 basis points to 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 17.6% in the third quarter of 2022. Gross margins were primarily impacted by transient margin compression, most notably in carbon sheet steel and stainless steel, as spot margins troughed mid-quarter before moving higher to end the year on an encouraging note. LIFO expense of $34.6 million was larger-than-expected, driven by average cost of inventory that ended the year at higher levels than anticipated primarily attributable to stainless steel market dynamics of an over-supplied North American Market versus stainless steel inputs such as nickel which rallied notably thru the fourth quarter. Declining average selling prices partially reversed during the second half of the fourth quarter leading Ryerson to record a LIFO expense of $34.6 million versus initial expectations of $20 million LIFO income for the quarter. This was due to average inventory costs ending the year higher than what was previously projected for each major commodity. In conjunction, inventory days of supply in the fourth quarter also rose to 90 days, compared with 83 days in the third quarter, and, as such, projected declines in average costs did not occur as anticipated. Although this had a one-time negative impact to margins in the quarter due to the timing of annual LIFO calculation, higher commodity futures provide a more positive outlook for the first half of 2023 than previously expected. Excluding the impact of LIFO, gross margin contracted 90 basis points to 15.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 16.2% in the third quarter, driven by the decline in average selling prices outpacing the decline in our cost of goods sold. Warehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2.1% to $190.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $186.5 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by costs related to acquisitions.  Net loss attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $24.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, compared to net income of $55.1 million, or $1.46 per diluted share in the previous quarter. During the fourth quarter, we recorded charges of $5.3 million for reorganization costs, primarily related to ERP system conversion as well as relocation expense for our new Centralia service center. Ryerson generated Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO of $28.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to third quarter 2022 Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO of $78.5 million. Market Commentary Ryerson's revenue of $1.28 billion in the fourth quarter was driven by an average selling price decrease of 8.1% to $2,770 per ton and a sales volume decrease of 9.2% to 465 thousand tons, compared to the third quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter revenue was at the high end of our guidance range of $1.25 to $1.30 billion, and our sequential volume decrease of 9.2% was partially due to normal holiday seasonal slowdown of our manufacturing customers. Liquidity & Debt Management Ryerson generated $181.6 million of operating cash in the fourth quarter of 2022 driven by working capital release of $207.4 million, which was slightly offset by a net loss of $23.8 million. Cash release was achieved despite the Company's cash conversion cycle increasing to 91.6 days, compared to 83.4 days in the third quarter of 2022. Ryerson's inventory build was driven by normal seasonality coupled with residual pandemic distortions in supply and withdrawal patterns in the second half of 2022 and an upward inflection in metals prices in the fourth quarter. As a result of strong operating cash flow, the Company ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $367 million of debt and $328 million of net debt, a decrease of $110 million and $98 million, respectively, compared to the third quarter. Ryerson's leverage ratio as of the fourth quarter of 2022 was 0.6x, near the Company's low-end target leverage range. Ryerson's global liquidity, composed of cash and cash equivalents and availability on its revolving credit facilities, increased to $909 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $906 million as of September 30, 2022. Shareholder Return Activity Dividends. On February 22, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share of common stock, payable on March 16, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 6, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2022, Ryerson paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.16 per share, amounting to a cash return of approximately $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full-year 2022, Ryerson paid approximately $20 million in dividends, with dividends per share of 53.5 cents on an annual basis. Share Repurchase. Ryerson repurchased approximately 33,000 shares of common stock resulting in a return to shareholders of approximately $0.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Ryerson made these repurchases in accordance with its share repurchase program, which authorizes the Company to acquire up to an aggregate amount of $75.0 million of the Company's common stock through August 3, 2024. For the full-year 2022, Ryerson returned approximately $50 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Outlook Commentary Ryerson is encouraged by improving sequential margin and demand conditions as experienced through the quarter to date as both spot and program margins have positively inflected and shipments are showing on par with typical sequential seasonality. As such, Ryerson anticipates first quarter net sales to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.43 billion, with pricing decreasing 1% to 3%, and shipment volumes increasing 10% to 12%. LIFO expense in the first quarter of 2023 is expected to be $5 million. We expect adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO in the range of $78 million to $82 million and earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.98 to $1.06.   Fourth Quarter 2022 Major Product Metrics Tons Shipped (thousands) Average Selling Prices Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Q3 2022 Year-over-year Quarter-over-quarter Year-over-year Quarter-over-quarter Carbon Steel 365 363 405 0.6 % (9.9) % (19.3) % (9.0) % Aluminum 45 47 49 (4.3) % (8.2) % 5.6 % (7.0) % Stainless Steel 52 63 56 (17.5) % (7.1 %) (6.8) % (8.9) % Net Sales (millions) Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Q3 2022 Year-over-year Quarter-over- quarter Carbon Steel $ 684 $ 843 $ 834 (18.9) % (18.0 %) Aluminum $ 269 $ 266 $ 315 1.1 % (14.6) % Stainless Steel $ 313 $ 407 $ 370 (23.1) % (15.4) %   Full Year 2022 Major Product Metrics Tons Shipped (thousands) Average Selling Prices 2022 2021 Year-over-year Year-over-year Carbon Steel 1,583 1,604 (1.3) % 11.8 % Aluminum 195 205 (4.9) % 24.1 % Stainless Steel 242 278 (12.9) % 24.5 % Net Sales (millions) 2022 2021 Year-over-year Carbon Steel $ 3,371 $ 3,056 10.3 % Aluminum $ 1,235 $ 1,046 18.1 % Stainless Steel $ 1,625 $ 1,499 8.4 %   Earnings Call Information Ryerson will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter 2022 financial results for the period ended December 31, 2022, on Thursday, February 23, 2023, at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.

Adjusted EBITDA gives further effect to, among other things, reorganization expenses, gain on sales of assets, gain or  loss on retirement of debt, pension settlement charge, purchase consideration and other transaction costs, and foreign currency  transaction gains and losses. We believe that the presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding  LIFO expense (income), provides useful information to investors regarding our operational performance because they enhance an  investor's overall understanding of our core financial performance and provide a basis of comparison of results between current,  past, and future periods. We also disclose the metric Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), to provide a means of  comparison amongst our competitors who may not use the same basis of accounting for inventories. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), are three of the primary metrics management uses for planning and  forecasting in future periods, including trending and analyzing the core operating performance of our business without the effect of  U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, expenses, revenues, and gains (losses) that are unrelated to the day to day  performance of our business. We also establish compensation programs for our executive management and regional employees that  are based upon the achievement of pre-established EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense  (income), targets. We also use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), to  benchmark our operating performance to that of our competitors. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding  LIFO expense (income), do not represent, and should not be used as a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted  EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), is necessarily an indication of whether cash flow will be sufficient to fund our cash  requirements. This release also presents gross margin, excluding LIFO expense (income), which is calculated as gross profit minus  LIFO expense (income), divided by net sales. We have excluded LIFO expense (income) from gross margin and Adjusted EBITDA  as a percentage of net sales metrics in order to provide a means of comparison amongst our competitors who may not use the same  basis of accounting for inventories as we do. Our definitions of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO  expense (income), gross margin, excluding LIFO expense (income), and Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO expense (income), as a  percentage of sales may differ from that of other companies.   Schedule 3 RYERSON HOLDING CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) and Earnings (Loss) per Share to Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (Dollars and Shares in Millions, Except Per Share Data) Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2022 2021 Net income (loss) attributable to Ryerson Holding  Corporation $ (24.1) $ 106.4 $ 55.1 $ 391.0 $ 294.3 Gain on bargain purchase ? ?
