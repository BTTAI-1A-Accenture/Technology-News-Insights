Most Widely Read Newspaper Inspector General of Police, Olukayode Egbetokun Kindly share this story: The acting Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun, on Tuesday, did that the police authorities are always conscious about the Commissioners of Police being posted to Oyo State due to the peculiarity of the state in terms of insecurity.
He made this disclosure during his visit to the Alarere residence of the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade II, in Ibadan, the state capital.
Egbetokun said, “We are always conscious of who to post here as the CP, and we don’t just send anybody here. We look out for who can give effective policing to the state and we appreciate our father, the Olubadan and his Council for the maximum support you have been giving us.”
The IGP further explained that the state is very strategic when the issue of security is concerned because of its location, antecedents and the topmost hierarchy of the Force always engages in thorough search for the officer to be assigned as the helmsman of the state command.  




He added that the new vision of the Force would be service driven, compliant with the rule of law, people-friendly, and adequate response to crime occurrence, to improve community and take the Force to the next level.
Egbetokun said, “To drive this vision, the roles of traditional rulers cannot be overemphasized and here I come to solicit for Your Majesty’s understanding and support.
“Your roles are very critical to our new vision. Our officers will work closely with you, they will be coming to you from time to time for advice and information as the case may be. I implore you to leave your doors open to them and together, with your cooperation and support, we will achieve our set objectives and goals of securing and protecting our dear country, Nigeria.”          Related News  IG deploys operatives to rescue kidnapped Benue medical students   Food crisis: Military deploys troops in North-West, N’Central farms  South East lawmakers petition IG, demand ‘Igbo must go’ sponsors arrest   
The police boss explained that his visit to the palace, the first of such to be made in the South-West, was to appreciate and thank the monarch for the support and cooperation the state Command has been enjoying.
He, therefore, called for the continuation of the good gesture, noting that the new vision of the Nigeria Police of community policing even demands for more from the traditional institution as the closest authority to the people.
Responding, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Balogun, through the ‘Baba Kekere’, Sen Kola Balogun, commended IGP Egbetokun for his resolve on community policing, which he described as the only sure way out of the nation’s security challenges.
The Olubadan said, “Oyo State is relatively peaceful, though, we have some pockets of security challenges, but, the CP has shown the capacity and capability to contain them since his arrival here for which we are very much grateful. The palace, I mean myself and my members of the Advisory Council, Mogajis and Baales will not relent in giving the Command all the necessary supports and needed cooperation to achieve the set-goal of securing the lives and property of our people.
“The IGP is the most perfect fit for the job at this period in the history of the country. Our IG is Enitan, he is a manifestation of abundance grace and mercy in view of what he has passed through in the force.
“You actually paid your dues. You cheated death on occasions, on two different occasions, you were denied your well deserved promotion to the position of Commissioner of Police, but, through the grace of God, you eventually reached the pinnacle of your career. That same grace will sustain and grant you huge success on this exalted seat.” He prayed.
Four members of the Olubadan Advisory Council namely Balogun of Ibadanland, Ashipa Balogun, Ekerin Olubadan and Ekerin Balogun, Obas Owolabi Olakulehin, Kolawole Adegbola, Hamidu Ajibade and Dada Isioye, respectively and three of the Mogajis, Asimiyu Adepoju (Ariori), Isiaka Raji (Elegbaaowo) and Kayode Ogunsola (Anisere) joined him to receive the IG.
