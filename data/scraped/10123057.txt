Listen to this article:  FIJI Weightlifting head coach Hendry Elder will be fielding a young squad to the Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands at the end of the year. Athletes as young as 14-year-olds have been reeled into the team, and Elder is adamant these athletes will only get better with time. “We have several young athletes in the team who are very talented. “Most of them have only been with us for about two months, and are lifting impressive weights,” he said. “These are athletes who have no experience in weightlifting, so this is good for us as we can slowly mold them over the years into an exceptional weightlifter.” Elder said bringing in young athletes would allow them to develop those athletes over the next few years and was excited about what was ahead for Fiji Weightlifting. “If they are already lifting these impressive weights by now, they should be very good weightlifters in a few years.” He also mentioned that he has several young athletes as well back in Levuka, who are also preparing to represent the country at the Pacific Games. “We have a handful of youngsters back in Levuka who are doing well, and we just cannot wait to get them out there and showcase their talent.” “Right now, some of these young athletes are ranked in the Commonwealth in their grades as number three or number two, so I can say we have some exciting times ahead of us.” He said it was unfortunate that Fiji did not take part in the Commonwealth Youth Championships, as he believed those athletes would have been able to secure several medals. “If we did, some of these athletes would be coming back to Fiji with medals.” No Posts found for specific category © 2024 FijiTimes.
