 Thousands  We chose Bank5 Connect High-Interest Checking for its high-interest checking account, which offers 2.70% APY on balances of $100 or more and comes with no monthly fees and the ability to earn cash-back rewards with your debit card. You’ll also get up to $15 per month in ATM fee reimbursements. Why We Like It We like Bank5’s high-yield, free checking account and its cash-back rewards debit card. The Bank5 Jumbo Savings account also offers a competitive 5.10% APY, but you’ll need to have a balance of at least $25,000 to qualify. What We Don’t Like Unless you can qualify for Bank5’s jumbo savings account, its savings rates aren’t the best around. Bank5’s ATM network is also fairly limited, but it does help that the bank doesn’t charge any ATM fees—and even offers reimbursements for ATM fees charged by other banks. Who It’s Best For You should look into Bank5 if you’re primarily looking for a rewarding, low-fee checking account. It might also be worth considering if you’ve got $25,000 or more to stash in savings. Residents of Massachusetts and Rhode Island are not eligible to bank with Bank5 Connect. Accounts are insured by the FDIC, and all deposits above the FDIC limit of $250,000 are 100% insured by Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF) protection.

 90,000+ ATMs nationwide  We chose Quontic Bank as one of the best online banks because it offers top APYs on all its accounts: 1.10% APY APY on its Quontic Bank High Interest Checking account, 4.50% APY on its Quontic Bank High Yield Savings account, 5.00% APY on its Quontic Bank Money Market Account and 4.30% to 5.10% APY on its Quontic Bank Certificate of Deposit. Why We Like It We like Quontic’s high APYs and low fees and minimum deposit requirements. The bank also has a Quontic Bank Cash Rewards Checking account that pays up to 1.00% cash back on all qualifying debit card transactions. What We Don’t Like Quontic makes it easy to earn the stated APY on most of its accounts but to earn the 1.10% APY APY with its High Interest Checking account, you’ll need to make at least 10 qualifying debit card transactions of at least $10 each per statement cycle. Who It’s Best For You should go for this online bank if you’re after high APYs and want to be able to take care of all your banking in one place. Quontic Bank offers one savings account, two checking accounts, a money market account and five CDs with terms ranging from six months to 60 months.

 43,000+ ATMs nationwide  In addition to its competitive rates, low minimum deposit requirements and lack of fees, we chose Ally Bank for its unique online savings tools. With Ally’s savings account, you can create “buckets” that allow you to set 10 different savings goals within a single account. The bank also has a “round ups” feature that transfers the spare change from your transactions into your savings account. And the bank’s “surprise savings” feature analyzes your Ally checking account for money that’s safe to save and transfers it to your savings account automatically. Why We Like It As a full-service online bank, Ally offers an array of high-APY, low-fee checking and savings products. It has an extensive ATM network and reimburses up to $10 per statement cycle for fees charged at out-of-network ATMs. What We Don’t Like Ally’s money market account and CD rates aren’t the highest available. Who It’s Best For Consider Ally Bank if you’re looking to boost your savings account balance—its combination of unique savings tools and a generous savings APY will help you get there. Ally Bank offers a savings account, interest-checking account, money market account and CD terms from three months to five years. It also offers a raise your rate CD with terms of two and four years and a no-penalty CD with a term of 11 months.

 60,000+  We chose Synchrony Bank because its Synchrony Bank High Yield Savings account pays 4.65% APY, charges no monthly fees and has no minimum deposit requirement. Unlike most savings accounts, Synchrony High Yield Savings comes with an ATM card for easy access to your funds. Why We Like It We like that all of Synchrony’s savings products—its high-yield savings account, money market account and CDs—charge no monthly fees and have no minimum deposit requirements. Its savings account APY is impressive, as are its rates on most CD terms. What We Don’t Like This online bank’s money market account pays less than what you could find elsewhere, and it doesn’t offer a checking account. Who It’s Best For Open an account at Synchrony Bank if you’re looking to open a high-yield savings account or CD, especially if you want to avoid monthly fees and minimum deposit requirements. Synchrony banking products do not have monthly service or minimum balance fees. Synchrony doesn’t charge a fee to use ATMs, however, there may be a fee charged by the ATM owner. Synchrony refunds up to $5 in ATM-owner fees each month, but if you reach Diamond status in Synchrony’s Perks Rewards program, you’ll get unlimited ATM fee refunds at domestic ATMs. Synchrony does not reimburse fees at international ATMs.

 60,000+ ATMs nationwide  Discover® Bank makes our list of best online banks for avoiding fees thanks to its zero-fees policy: no monthly maintenance fees, no insufficient funds fees and no out-of-network ATM fees. There’s also no fee for stop-payment orders, returned items or excessive withdrawals. Why We Like It Discover offers a full suite of banking products and services, including the Discover® Bank Online Savings Account earning 4.25% APY and the Discover® Cashback Debit Checking account that earns 1% cash back on up to $3,000 in debit card purchases each month. See website for details. And customers have access to an extensive ATM network. What We Don’t Like This online bank’s MMA and CD rates could be improved, although it does offer one of the best rates on 10-year CDs. Who It’s Best For Anyone looking to minimize fees while still earning competitive rates and rewards should look into Discover. Discover Bank offers a cash back checking account, a high-yield savings account, a money market account and CDs with terms from three months to 10 years. The mobile app is highly rated on the App Store and Google Play.

 37,000+ ATMs nationwide  We included NBKC Bank because it’s a full-service bank that offers interest-bearing accounts and keeps fees to an absolute minimum. There are no monthly maintenance fees, overdraft fees, minimum balance fees or foreign transaction fees. Plus, NBKC offers home loans, personal loans and more, so you can take care of all your financial needs in one place. Why We Like It NBKC Bank Everything Account is an interest-bearing checking and savings account combined into one. You can spend, save and pay bills from a single account. It comes with an extensive ATM network and reimburses up to $12 per month for out-of-network ATM fees. Its CD rates are also fairly competitive. What We Don’t Like While the Everything Account’s APY is impressive for a checking account, you could earn a lot more on your savings with one of the best high-yield savings accounts. NBKC’s money market account doesn’t offer the highest rate either. Who It’s Best For Go for NBKC Bank if you want to take care of all of your online banking, and potentially your loans, in one place. It’s also worth checking out if you like the idea of a combined checking and savings account. NBKC Bank offers a combined checking and savings account, a money market account and CD terms from three months to five years. It also has an add-on CD that has a term of one year.

 55,000+  We ranked SoFi highly because its combined checking and savings account comes with a mobile check deposit feature that allows you to snap a photo of your check and access your funds as early as one day later. This free, interest-bearing account also comes with early direct deposit. Why We Like It You’ll earn 0.50% APY on checking and 4.60% APY on savings if you set up direct deposit or by depositing $5,000 or more every 30 days. Customers who don’t meet this criteria earn 1.20% APY on savings balances with the SoFi Checking and Savings Account. You can even earn cash back when you use your SoFi debit card at qualifying businesses. What We Don’t Like This bank doesn’t offer standalone checking or savings accounts, nor does it offer money market or CD accounts. Who It’s Best For Opt for SoFi if you’re looking for a free checking and savings account that earns competitive yields and comes with extra online banking features like mobile check deposit and savings roundups. SoFi doesn’t offer separate checking or savings accounts at this time—only the combined SoFi Checking and Savings Account account. Up to 4.60%¹ APY on checking and savings account balances can be yours when you set up direct deposit or by depositing $5,000 or more every 30 days. Members without direct deposit earn 1.20% APY on savings balances. When you open an account, you become a SoFi member, which comes with access to additional benefits like rate reductions on loan products, financial planning services, estate planning discounts, access to exclusive SoFi events and more. SoFi members with Direct Deposit or $5,000 or more in Qualifying Deposits during the 30-Day Evaluation Period can earn 4.60% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. There is no minimum Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the stated interest rate. Members without either Direct Deposit or Qualifying Deposits, during the 30-Day Evaluation Period will earn 1.20% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances. Interest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 10/24/2023. There is no minimum balance requirement.

 100,000+ ATMs nationwide  We awarded EverBank (formerly TIAA Bank) a top spot for its EverBank Basic CD, which pay competitive rates ranging from 3.65% to 4.95% APY and have a modest opening deposit requirement of $1,000. EverBank CDs come in terms ranging from three months to five years. Why We Like It In addition to its competitive CD rates, EverBank charges no monthly fees on its bank accounts, no overdraft fee from a linked EverBank account and no ATM fees. EverBank’s checking account also automatically reimburses up to $15 each month for third-party ATM charges. Keep a minimum balance of $5,000 or more in your checking account and you’ll get unlimited ATM reimbursements. What We Don’t Like The online bank’s money market account doesn’t pay the highest rate, and EverBank doesn’t offer any CD accounts with terms longer than five years. Who It’s Best For EverBank is best for strategic savers who want to leverage a CD ladder to their advantage. The bank offers eight term lengths under three years and lets you build that sees a CD mature every three months. However, EverBank doesn’t currently offer any CD terms longer than five years. EverBank offers a checking account (Yield Pledge Checking), a savings account, a money market account (Yield Pledge Money Market), basic CDs, a bump-up CD and what it calls an IntraFi CD, a CD that offers expanded FDIC insurance on deposits.

 70,000+ ATMs nationwide  We chose Capital One 360 as a top pick for customer service because it offers 24/7 customer service and has been ranked highest in overall customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for four years in a row. This bank is also a unique hybrid of a no-monthly-fee online bank and a brick-and-mortar bank. Its Capital One Cafés offer a place to get personal, face-to-face support from bank representatives and money coaches in a coffee-shop atmosphere. And Eno, the bank’s virtual assistant, is available in the mobile app or by text. Why We Like It None of the bank’s products require a minimum deposit or minimum balance, and Capital One 360 offers high yields on savings and CD accounts. What We Don’t Like This online bank’s Capital One Cafés are a unique perk, but it only has locations in select cities. Who It’s Best For Consider Capital One 360 if you want the low fees and high yields offered by online banks but don’t want to sacrifice good customer service to get them. Capital One 360 offers a savings account (360 Performance Savings), checking account (360 Checking) and CDs (360 CDs). It also offers a Kids Savings Account and MONEY Teen Checking.

 N/A, $10 in ATM fee reimbursements per month  We picked First Internet Bank as the best online bank for small businesses because it offers an array of low-fee and interest-bearing business checking, savings, CD and money market accounts. Its Do More Business Checking account has no monthly maintenance fees or minimum deposit requirements, earns interest, and offers unlimited transactions. The bank’s First Internet Bank Certificate of Deposit (Personal) also pay a generous 4.14% to 5.26% APY. Why We Like It We love the rates on this bank’s business MMA and CDs. We also like that it offers two free checking accounts—one designed for new or growing businesses and one for medium- to large-sized businesses. Its personal accounts also come with decent rates and low fees. What We Don’t Like First Internet Bank’s savings rates on both its business and personal accounts are fairly low. Who It’s Best For Look into First Internet Bank if you want to open a business checking account, or a business or personal CD account. First Internet Bank has two business checking accounts, a regular business savings account, a business money market account and business CDs with terms ranging from three months to five years. Do More Business Checking has no monthly fee, but you need to maintain a minimum $10,000 balance to earn interest. Money Market Savings has a $5 monthly fee, waived with a $4,000 minimum daily balance. It earns 3.46% APY with a daily balance of $5 million or below and 5.48% APY with a daily balance above $5 million. Regular Savings has a $2
2 monthly fee, waived with a $1,000 minimum daily balance. It earns 0.91% on all balances. You’ll need to call the bank for information about Commercial Checking. 
 Online banking is banking conducted virtually, either through a website or mobile app. Rather than going to a branch or ATM to manage your money, you can do so via your laptop or smartphone. Most traditional banks and credit unions offer online banking services to their customers. The range of services available usually doesn’t differ that much from what you’d find at the best online banks. The difference is that with traditional banking, you also have the option of visiting a branch. With online-only banking, you don’t. Customers of online banks can initiate transactions online, through a mobile app, by phone or by mail. They also can link online bank accounts with accounts they have at traditional banks, credit unions or other online banks. Online banking products and services vary by institution. Generally, online banks offer the ability to open accounts, pay bills, transfer funds, deposit checks, view statements and carry out other typical banking tasks. Many also offer access to surcharge-free ATM networks. Online banks offer a number of advantages. Lower Fees Online banks have lower overhead costs and tend to charge fewer fees than brick-and-mortar banks. Many of the best banks online charge no: Some online banks even offer ATM fee reimbursements for any fees charged by out-of-network ATM operators. Higher Interest Rates Not only do low costs mean fewer fees, but they also mean more competitive interest rates on checking accounts, savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts. Online banks tend to offer APYs well above the national average. Extra Features Some of the best online bank accounts come with digital extras that offer convenience and can help you budget and save. These include: Easy Applications Online banks allow you to apply for accounts fully online, and their application processes often only take minutes to completely. The best online banks also have sleek, easy-to-use web and mobile interfaces. Many people are switching to online banks, but they aren’t without their drawbacks. No Branch Access The most obvious disadvantage of online banks is that they don’t offer brick-and-mortar locations. This means you can’t do your banking in person. ATM Networks May Be Limited Many online banks have large ATM networks comparable to what traditional banks offer, but some online banks have a smaller or no ATM network. These banks typically offer some form of ATM fee reimbursements so you can use ATMs at other banks and not have to worry about fees, but these reimbursements may be limited to a certain amount per month. May Not Accept Cash Deposits Many online banks don’t accept cash deposits. If you regularly get paid in cash, make sure to find one that does—or opt for a brick-and-mortar bank. Limited Range of Services While plenty of online banks offer a full range of bank accounts, they may not offer all the financial products and services you’d find at a traditional bank. You may only have one option when it comes to choosing a checking or savings account, and some online banks don’t provide lending or investment services. Here are some other things to consider when choosing an online bank: Generally, online banks are safe. Look for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure your accounts. Online banks with FDIC insurance have the same protections as banks with branches. In many ways, online accounts are safer than traditional bank accounts because of online statements and the focus on digital transactions instead of paper checks. Avoiding paper statements and checks eliminates an opportunity for fraud that many thieves take advantage of. You can open a bank account online via your chosen bank or credit union’s website or mobile app. From there, you’ll generally follow the same steps that you would to open a bank account at a branch. Here’s a typical step-by-step process for opening a bank account online: Related to: Online Banks Vs. Traditional Banks: Which Are Better? –Elizabeth Aldrich, deputy editor at Forbes Advisor However, if you prefer face-to-face interactions and still like to take care of some of your banking needs in person, an online bank might not be the best choice for you. To create this list, Forbes Advisor analyzed the products and services of 60 online banks, including a mix of large and small online banks and neobanks. We ranked each bank on 12 data points within the categories of product offerings, APY, fees, ATM network, customer experience, digital experience and minimum requirements. Here’s the weighting assigned to each category: Online banks offering the highest APYs and lowest fees across their products rose to the top of the list, as did those with a low minimum deposit and balance requirements and a broad ATM network.

The best online banks are those that meet your needs. If you’re happy with your current banking relationship but want to earn more interest on your savings, consider finding an online bank with a competitive high-yield savings account. If you’re looking to replace your current bank, focus on the overall package. Look for an online bank that keeps fees and minimum requirements low, offers high APYs and provides easy access to your money via ATMs and mobile apps. Seek out a bank with excellent customer service as well. The FDIC insures many online banks. Other online banks are affiliated with brick-and-mortar banks that are FDIC insured. And some offer additional insurance protections through organizations like the Massachusetts Depositors Insurance Fund (DIF). FDIC-insured accounts are covered up to $250,000 per depositor, for each ownership category, in the event of a bank failure. Before opening a bank account, confirm that the financial institution is FDIC insured. Look for the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to insure nationally chartered, and many state-chartered, credit unions for similar amounts. Online banks usually don’t operate their own branded ATMs, but in many cases, they offer fee-free ATM access through partner banks. ATM networks vary in size depending on which bank you use, with some of the best online banks offering free access to more than 37,000 ATMs nationwide. If you withdraw cash often, check whether your account comes with ATM fee reimbursements, as out-of-network ATM surcharges can quickly add up. There’s no such thing as a completely free bank account. All bank accounts come with fees attached in some form. But it is possible to find checking accounts and savings accounts with no monthly maintenance fees. You can retrieve your bank statements by logging into your account and navigating to the statements page of your bank’s website. Online bank accounts can become locked for a few reasons. Banks can freeze them if incorrect credentials, such as a username or password, are entered too many times. Accounts could also become locked if the online bank detects suspicious activity, such as fraud or money laundering. In some cases, your account could be locked if you have too many unpaid debts with creditors or the government. You might not be able to open a bank account online if you don’t have certain required documents, such as a government-issued photo ID, U.S. residential address, Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Additionally, your application might be denied if you’ve had too many negative marks, such as overdrafts or bounced checks, reported to ChexSystems. If your online bank has an ATM network that allows cash deposits, you can typically deposit cash at an in-network ATM the same way you would with a traditional bank. Some online banks without ATM networks offer cash deposits at certain retailers, though this may result in a fee of up to $5 or more. Many online banks don’t support cash deposits at all but may offer a mobile check deposit feature.
