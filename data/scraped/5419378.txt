The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. Today is World Teen Mental Health Day — a time to raise awareness about the mental health issues facing teens. Health experts say parents and caregivers play a critical role in their child's emotional well-being. Addressing mental health issues, when it comes to your children, isn't always easy, though it's critical.  “So many of our young people are struggling,” Alfiee M. Breland-Noble, a psychologist, said. A recent CDC survey of youth collected in 2021 finds increasing mental health challenges, experiences of violence and suicidal thoughts and behavior among all teens, especially girls and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Breland-Noble said one of the most important things parents can do is to show children ways of dealing with mental health issues by facing their own.  “If we don't model it, we don't give our young people a chance to see what it looks like and we don't demonstrate to them that we take mental health seriously,” Breland-Noble said. If you or someone you know needs help, you can talk with the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or sending a text message to 988, or you can chat online here.
