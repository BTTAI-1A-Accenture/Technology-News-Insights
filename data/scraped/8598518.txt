Nayli Russo is challenging the traditional norms of leadership, where assertiveness and competitiveness often overshadow qualities like empathy and collaboration. She firmly believes that women leaders bring unique perspectives and qualities to the table, and it’s crucial to foster an environment where these strengths can flourish. “Nurturing purposeful leadership requires embracing the values of empathy, compassion, and inclusivity,” Nayli states. “It’s about empowering individuals to lead authentically and create spaces where everyone’s voice is heard and valued.” For Nayli, leadership isn’t just a position; it’s a mindset. Through her signature program, Breakthrough Academy, she guides women in developing a leadership mindset that transcends job titles and empowers them to lead from wherever they are. “Leadership is not confined to a boardroom or a corner office. It’s about influencing and inspiring others, regardless of your role,” Nayli explains. “When women embrace their leadership potential and recognize the impact they can make, it creates a ripple effect of positive change.” Nayli Russo is passionate about empowering women to lead authentically. She believes that women leaders thrive when they stay true to themselves and their values, rather than conforming to societal expectations. “Authenticity is a powerful leadership quality. When leaders embrace their uniqueness and vulnerability, it fosters trust and builds strong connections,” Nayli says. Through her coaching, Nayli helps women leaders tap into their authentic selves, enabling them to lead with confidence and create meaningful connections with their teams. Diversity and inclusion are at the core of Nayli’s leadership philosophy. She advocates for diverse perspectives and believes that inclusive leadership drives innovation and fosters a culture of belonging. “To build a truly inclusive organization, leaders must actively seek diverse voices, perspectives, and backgrounds,” Nayli emphasizes. “Inclusivity is not just about meeting quotas; it’s about creating an environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute their best.” Through her work as Vice President of People & Strategy for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Nayli has spearheaded initiatives to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the organization. She is passionate about dismantling barriers and creating opportunities for underrepresented groups. In today’s fast-paced world, women leaders often face the challenge of balancing ambition and well-being. Nayli emphasizes the importance of self-care and setting boundaries to avoid burnout. “Leadership is not about sacrificing your well-being for success. It’s about thriving in all aspects of life,” Nayli states. “Taking care of yourself allows you to be a more effective leader and role model for others.” Through her coaching, Nayli helps women leaders prioritize their well-being while pursuing their ambitious goals, creating a sustainable path to success. Nayli Russo is committed to championing the next generation of women leaders.
