WEST ORANGE, NJ — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified a small right-of-way in West Orange to further probe as part of a national campaign to investigate telecommunication cables containing lead lining, town officials said Monday. West Orange’s municipal public information officer released a statement about the investigation, which may begin as early as Tuesday: He continued: West Orange township has advised homeowners of the possible presence of EPA agents or other utility workers in the street around their property, officials added. For more information, contact Shereen Kandil at the EPA at 212-637-4333 or kandil.shereen@epa.gov. The federal agency said it is closely reviewing issues raised in The Wall Street Journal's recent investigation of lead-clad telecom cables. Earlier this month, environmental groups called on the EPA to investigate what they called “the uncontrolled release of lead by more than 2,000 lead-sheathed telecom cables into water or surface soil across the nation.” More than 300 of these cables are posing a threat to community drinking water sources, the groups alleged. Last week, the EPA said it sent letters to AT&T and Verizon, requiring both companies to provide the agency with information in its ongoing review of risks, Reuters reported. Over the coming weeks, the EPA said it will conduct independent sampling starting in West Orange and Coal Center, Pennsylvania. AT&T has criticized the Journal's reporting, saying that it has no reason to believe the cables pose public health risks, Reuters reported.
