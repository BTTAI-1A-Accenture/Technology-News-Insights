Jun Wang new Professor Jun Wang received a research award of $249,829 from the National Foundation Foundation. This transformative venture aims to uncover the secrets behind how the structure of materials influences their properties with the assistance of AI, ultimately leading to the creation of materials with tailored characteristics. Imagine materials that can do extraordinary things, such as changing shape or exhibiting unique mechanical traits like negative parameters. This project seeks to achieve that by intelligently designing the microscopic architecture of materials. And here's the kicker: It could lead to the development of promising advanced materials with unprecedented functionalities.
