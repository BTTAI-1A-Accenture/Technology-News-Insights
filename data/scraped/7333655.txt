Andrew Shell, 23, is charged with rape, strangulation and imprisonment A woman told police she had an online romantic relationship with a man on the "MeetMe" website  and that two days after they finally met, he held her captive, raped her and forced her to perform oral sex on him, a court document said.  An APD sex crimes unit detective spoke to the woman at University of New Mexico Hospital, where she went and reported to police that she had been sexually assaulted by a man named Andrew Shell. She told the detective that Shell also physically assaulted her and used his arm to choke her until she was almost unconscious, the document said. Based on the woman's report, police went to Shell's apartment on Madeira Drive SE and took him into custody while they sought a search warrant, the document said.  The woman told the detective she was only able to get away from Shell, who she said had consumed a lot of alcohol, by promising not to break up with him, the document said. In an interview with police, Shell said the sex with the woman had been consensual and that he never assaulted her and had consumed only a small amount of alcohol on the day in question, the document said. Shell was arrested and booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center on charges of criminal sexual penetration, aggravated battery against a household member (strangulation), false imprisonment and criminal sexual contact.
