At PACK EXPO Las Vegas, Mauser Packaging Solutions showed off its tight-head container made with 100% post-consumer resin. With a booth at PACK EXPO Las Vegas highlighting a variety of more sustainable  packaging, a key new development on display from Mauser Packaging Solutions was  its UN-rated tight-head container made with 100% post-consumer resin (PCR).  This is the first of its kind, according to Chris Bradshaw, explaining the  difficulty of making such a container durable and reliable. Mauser’s closed-loop system is key, Bradshaw says, to better  control the consistency of materials being recycled. “We are able to reuse our  own resin and create a fortified package,” he says, explaining the different  melt levels in various resins. “This is probably a 4 or 6 melt. You might have  other resins that are going to be a 30 melt, and that’s going to be a lot more  degraded; you’re going to have a bit more impurities with that resin, so it’s  not going to allow you to get the stack strength that you need out of it.” The new tight-head container is made with recycled HDPE  produced at Mauser’s own industrial packaging facilities. The closed loop also  enables Mauser to get a solid color that’s relatively consistent throughout. “That’s  very rare when you’re dealing with post-consumer anything or PIR, post-industrial  resin,” Bradshaw says. Available in 19- and 20-L capacities, the tight-head  containers have a range of uses, from flavored syrups for the beverage industry  to fertilizers for cannabis growers. The container is UN-rated 3H1W/Y1.8/100. It  satisfies California Prop. 65 requirements for rigid plastic packaging containers  (RPPCs) and meets requirements for Prop. 65 heavy metal PPM.   The recycled HDPE gives the container about a 60% smaller  carbon footprint vs. tight-head containers made with virgin HDPE.
