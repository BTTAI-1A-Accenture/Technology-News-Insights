 Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage Following up on our previous highlight on the best altcoins to invest in, we bring you a fresh set of assets to invest in right now. Before the list, take a look at the financial updates.¬† The cryptocurrency markets began the week uncertainly, as traders awaited US inflation data and watched for potential asset sales by the troubled FTX crypto exchange. Many of the top 20 digital assets by market capitalization experienced declines ranging from 2% to 4% on Monday. Bitcoin‚Äôs value dropped by 2% to $25,000, while Ether fell by 3.5% to $1,560. Solana (SOL), the largest cryptocurrency on FTX‚Äôs balance sheet, saw a 9% decline over the past week. Other significant FTX holdings, including Ripple (XRP), Aptos (APT), and BitDAO (BIT), also experienced declines of 6.7%, 8.7%, and 9.5%, respectively. The market focuses on a US court‚Äôs forthcoming decision, expected on September 13, regarding FTX‚Äôs proposed asset sales. With cryptocurrencies, you always have options. This barrage of options means an investor is scarcely ever handicapped when making decisions. The list of altcoins we have put together highlights alternatives to major cryptos. Although risks might be involved, these altcoins can still go on an amazing bull run.¬† Below is our list of best altcoins to invest in now with an added presale token.¬† Compound is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol that enables users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies by depositing them into supported pools on the platform. Users who deposit tokens into a Compound pool receive cTokens in return. These cTokens represent the individual‚Äôs share in the pool and can be redeemed for the underlying cryptocurrency initially deposited into the pool at any time. For instance, depositing ETH into a pool would yield cETH in return. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens to the underlying asset increases, allowing users to redeem them for more of the underlying asset than they initially contributed, thus generating interest.  Conversely, borrowers can obtain secured loans from any Compound pool by providing collateral. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio varies depending on the collateral asset, ranging from 50% to 75%. The interest rate borrowers pay differs according to the borrowed asset, and borrowers risk automatic liquidation if their collateral falls below a specific maintenance threshold.

Instead, RLB tokens were airdropped for free to existing users of Rollbit‚Äôs casino and trading platform, Rollbit.com. The RLB lottery catalyzes demand for the token, utilizing RLB as entry tickets that offer holders the chance to partake in a share of the casino‚Äôs profits.  The prizes awarded in the lottery are funded from a profit-sharing pool, where 20% of the casino‚Äôs daily profits accumulate throughout each round. Rollbit, having a well-established product and operating at a profit even before the token‚Äôs launch, provided immediate utility to RLB by integrating it into the lottery, with prizes originating from a portion of Rollbit‚Äôs profits. The total supply of RLB is capped at 5 billion coins. RLB tokens must be staked in each round, with half of the 0.20% staking fee permanently burned, reducing the token supply. I think this win speaks for itself üé¢ pic.twitter.com/0L1GCKogQ9 ‚Äî Rollbit (@rollbitcom) September 13, 2023  The circulating supply gradually decreases as each round progresses and RLB tokens are burned. This mechanism helps support the appreciation of RLB‚Äôs value. The other half of the staking fees is directed towards staked Rollbots, part of Rollbit‚Äôs NFT project. When all RLB tokens are staked, there will be an annual burn rate of 45% of the total supply. Increased staking further reduces the supply as more tokens are burned for lottery participation. As demand for RLB increases over time, this exerts upward pressure on its price. Toncoin (TON) is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain that originated from the development efforts of the encrypted messaging platform Telegram in 2018. Originally named the ‚ÄúTelegram Open Network,‚Äù the project transformed, being taken over by the TON Foundation and rebranded as ‚ÄúThe Open Network. Following Telegram‚Äôs withdrawal from the project, development has continued, primarily led by a non-commercial group of supporters and an independent community known as the TON Foundation. Toncoin, previously referred to as Gram, is the native cryptocurrency of the TON network.  Clients engage with the network by paying transaction fees and utilizing TON for settling payments and validating transactions. Toncoin operates on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model, ensuring network scalability and reliability. According to the project‚Äôs website, it offers users fast, transparent, and secure payment services, enabling transactions with minimal fees and supporting third-party applications. Developers aspire to construct a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing decentralized storage, decentralized services, a domain name system (DNS) equivalent, an anonymous network, an instant payment platform, and efficient, cost-effective transaction processing. üì£ Major news from #TOKEN2049 ‚Äì #TON-based @wallet_tg goes live for @telegram's 800 million users, in new integration. üéâ Let‚Äôs celebrate the largest #Web3 onboarding event ever, together! Comment #TONxTelegram, retweet, and scan to get $TON in 2 taps! pic.twitter.com/NyeMz71vbC ‚Äî TON üíé (@ton_blockchain) September 13, 2023  The Open Network stands out for its ability to process and validate many transactions per second (TPS). In September 2021, the network achieved a world record of 55,000 TPS during a contest, and it‚Äôs currently capable of handling hundreds of thousands or even millions of TPS. This feature positions the project for rapid growth without compromising performance while remaining environmentally friendly. Polkadot is an open-source, sharded multichain protocol designed to connect and secure a network of specialized blockchains. Its primary function is to enable cross-chain transfer of various data and asset types, extending interoperability beyond tokens and supporting a decentralized internet of blockchains, often called Web3. Polkadot operates as a layer-0 metaprotocol, serving as the foundational layer for a network of layer-1 blockchains known as parachains (parallel chains). As a meta protocol, Polkadot can autonomously and effortlessly update its codebase through on-chain governance, following the decisions of its token holder community.  The fundamental goal of Polkadot is to establish a decentralized web controlled by its users and simplify the creation of new applications, institutions, and services within this ecosystem. 1/üö® A new long-term strategic partnership between @ZodiaCustody and @paritytech will enable institutional access ‚Äì including staking ‚Äì to the Polkadot ecosystem! pic.twitter.com/BO8hocrI73 ‚Äî Polkadot (@Polkadot) September 13, 2023  Polkadot‚Äôs protocol facilitates the connection of various blockchains, including public and private chains, permissionless networks, oracles, and future technologies. These independent blockchains can securely share information and conduct transactions via the Polkadot Relay Chain.¬† Bitcoin BSC represents a groundbreaking fusion of Bitcoin‚Äôs timeless value and the cutting-edge technology of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This integration introduces an innovative staking mechanism designed for sustainability and encouraging long-term token holding. It redefines how token-based rewards and participation work within the cryptocurrency space. Operating as a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain, Bitcoin BSC places significant emphasis on staking. Unlike traditional Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin BSC offers $BTCBSC token holders the opportunity to generate passive income through staking activities. These rewards directly correlate with the number of tokens staked, mirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs original block reward mechanism. The video below compares BTCBSC to a similar project that rose approximately 500% after launch, BTC20.  BTCBSC combines the enduring appeal of Bitcoin with the sustainability and engagement potential of staking. Bitcoin BSC provides a unique avenue for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to actively participate in the network while enjoying the benefits of long-term token holding. It represents a project that bridges the best aspects of Bitcoin and staking, opening up new possibilities for the broader cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin BSC‚Äôs Stake-to-Earn model is an environmentally conscious alternative to Bitcoin‚Äôs resource-intensive Proof-of-Work mechanism. This innovation aligns with Bitcoin‚Äôs historical milestones, including its estimated 120-year issuance schedule and block confirmations since April 2011. https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbsctoken/status/1699000085290369232 Within the Bitcoin BSC ecosystem, staking rewards are directly tied to a participant‚Äôs stake in the staking pool and the prevailing Annual Percentage Yield (APY). This unique model fosters a decentralized and actively engaged community, ensuring the continuous expansion of the token ecosystem. Bitcoin BSC reduces its environmental impact by incentivizing long-term holding and active participation through staking. It empowers its community members to play an integral role in the network‚Äôs growth and sustainability. It represents a remarkable evolution of the traditional Bitcoin model, ushering in a new era of eco-conscious and community-driven cryptocurrency engagement.
