Lineage Logistics in Novi, a temperature-controlled industrial REIT and integrated solutions provider, has acquired eight facilities from Delaware-based Burris Logistics, a temperature-controlled food distribution company. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The addition of the eight cold storage facilities to Lineageâs warehousing network will provide nearly 1.3 million square feet of capacity and approximately 115,000 pallet positions across facilities in Lakeland and Jacksonville, Fla.; McDonough, Ga.; Edmond, Okla.; New Castle, Del.; Waukesha, Wisc.; and Federalsburg, Md. âThis deal represents the trust we have built and the track record we have delivered across our longstanding relationship with Burris, which is demonstrative of Lineage being the industryâs acquiror of choice,â says Greg Lehmkuhl, president and CEO of Lineage. âAs with our previous acquisitions from Burris, these complementary locations and their supremely dedicated team members will further fuel Lineageâs fierce customer-driven approach and serve our vision to become the worldâs most dynamic temperature-controlled logistics company.â A nearly century-old, family-owned business, Burris has developed relationships with some of the nationâs leading retailers and foodservice companies. The acquired facilities are located in the Eastern, Southern, and Midwestern United States, near major highways and transportation hubs, and will serve densely populated markets to help Lineageâs direct-to-consumer fulfillment operation reach all 50 states. Lineageâs team has more than 14 years of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer fulfillment experience, managing the end-to-end experience for more than 100 customers across eight existing locations. The acquisition of these facilities will bolster Lineageâs direct-to-consumer system that uses Lineageâs leading cold storage network. The transaction represents Lineageâs third proprietary deal with Burris. Lineage acquired its Lyndhurst, Va. and Haines City, Fla. locations in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Editor: R.J. King
