tvN has shared a fun new sneak peek of its upcoming drama “My Lovely Liar”! “My Lovely Liar” is a mystery romance drama about a woman who can hear lies and a genius music producer who is hiding his identity. Kim So Hyun will star as Mok Sol Hee, whose supernatural ability to detect lies has made her lose faith in other people, while Hwang Minhyun will play her reclusive next-door neighbor Kim Do Ha, who must hide his face from the world due to an unspeakable secret. The newly released teaser begins with Kim Do Ha, who is wary of strangers, asking Mok Sol Hee, “Do you know me, by any chance?” Someone then describes the mysterious producer in voice-over, saying, “How should I put it? He’s a bit strange. Nothing is known about him except that he’s a man. And he doesn’t meet people.” As she catches Kim Do Ha amusingly trying to hide from people, the cynical Mok Sol Hee decides that the strange man must be “an attention-seeker” and dismisses his eccentric behavior as a “mysterious concept.” However, after Kim Do Ha moves in next door to Mok Sol Hee, the two unusual neighbors get unexpectedly close. Kim Do Ha asks, “Didn’t seeing my face make you think of something?” and Mok Sol Hee replies, “Just… that you’re handsome?” Although Mok Sol Hee has the ability to hear people’s lies, her superpower proves useless around Kim Do Ha, who never seems to lie to her. The preview ends with her asking cautiously, “Do you normally not tell lies?” He then makes her heart skip a beat by declaring, “You’re pretty.” “My Lovely Liar” will premiere on July 31 at 8:50 p.m. KST.
