 It's Gaming Week at the Razer Store on Amazon. That means you can save big on gaming laptops and accessories. It's worth browsing the entire sale to see if anything sticks out for your particular gaming setup, but the Razer Blade 15 offers some of the biggest savings. The biggest savings, at least by percentage, is the model with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU. It's discounted to $2,000, which is a savings of $1,000 (33%). While those internals are now one generation old, they are still powerful enough to handle the best PC games. Your favorite titles should look great as well on the QHD display with a refresh rate of 240Hz.
