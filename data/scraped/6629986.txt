Learn more › You don’t have to be on a movie set or on a tour of duty to use night-vision goggles. While the most advanced NVGs are still largely reserved for those in the armed forces—as well as the exciting missions depicted by Hollywood—many of the best night-vision goggles have become affordable enough for general use. So if you’re looking to see the campsite in a new light or have a clearer view of when you have a clear shot, you can find a pair of goggles that’ll suit your needs. Still, because NVGs are so often associated with special ops, it’s understandable if you feel a little left in the dark. This guide is meant to enlighten your search for the best night-vision goggles.      There’s a major difference between a cheap pair of night-vision goggles that use the term “night vision” loosely and those that are budget-friendly and tactical. To sort out the toys from the tried-and-trues, we looked at critical reviews, user recommendations, conducted first-hand testing, and performed heavy research. We also consulted experts who have contributed to outdoor publications like Field & Stream and Outdoor Life. Whether you need night sight on the boat, on the trail, or on duty, here are the best night-vision goggles as we see them.  Why it made the cut: Reliable performance, user-friendly zoom, and daytime color controls at a great price point.  Specs Pros Cons Whether you’re hiking under the stars or hunting under the cover of darkness, the  Bushnell Equinox X650 Night Vision Monocular can improve your nocturnal adventures. The built-in columnated infrared illuminator lets you see in pitch blackness, while the 32mm objective lens lets in plenty of light and affords a field of view of 26 feet at a distance of 100 yards. The 5X zooming means that the deer you’re hunting or the owl you’re watching will look even bigger. Meanwhile, these infrared goggles are themselves nicely compact, measuring under eight inches long, under six inches wide, and clocking in at less than a pound. Once you pop the batteries in, you’ll get up hours of use that’ll let your target be seen at night. Why it made the cut: An IP67 waterproof rating adds durability in case of a spill on a near-starless, moonless night. Specs Pros Cons With an IP67 waterproof rating, the SiOnyx Aurora camera can survive falling into the water near the shore. (The included case is waterproof, too). The camera also features GPS, as well as a compass and accelerometer, offering useful information when you’re out on the water. The infrared technology lets you see in near-starless, moonless conditions, and you can sync the camera to your smartphone to stream your night footage wirelessly. You can also save footage via the 32GB microSD card. That’s all packed into a portable night-vision monocular that weighs less than three-quarters of a pound.  Why it made the cut: These wireless-enabled 4K goggles feature a 1,000-yard zoom range and a laser rangefinder, making them a strong choice for long-distance spotting. Specs Pros Cons If long-distance night vision is what you’re after, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more capable option than the ATN BinoX 4K. With its eye-watering 1,000-yard maximum zoom range, integrated 1080p microSD video recording, and laser rangefinder, the BinoX 4K is built to expand the range of your outdoor adventures in a convenient binocular-style form. The goggles use a 4K UHD sensor to deliver crisp picture quality at zoom distances of up to 10x before any resolution loss, and if you’re hunting on a team, the BinoX 4K can tag and send target location information to any other ATN devices and smartphones. While the ATN BinoX 4K features an integrated infrared (IR) lamp, its effective range naturally begins to drop at a distance of around 100 yards, making it ineffective for the goggles’ full zoom range in full darkness. The goggles are also marketed as being weatherproof, but as they lack a specific IP rating you’ll want to be mindful if working in wet conditions. Why it made the cut: Tactical night-vision goggles that are trusted by police forces and militaries around the world. Specs Pros Cons The Armasight PVS-14 Gen 3 Multi-Purpose Monoculars are used by militaries around the world, so you know right away they’re serious. Add a 40-degree field of view and infrared illuminator, and you’ll find some of the best night-vision goggles. It’s no wonder that they’re used by police officers and military units alike. These military night-vision goggles, with up to 50 hours of battery life, will automatically adjust to the brightness in your environment. Plus, they have an ergonomic design with easy-to-use controls. They are regulated under International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) guidelines, which means you can’t bring this NVG outside U.S. soil. Why it made the cut: A powerful casual option for helping your young one get in touch with nature.  Specs Pros Cons The JStoon Night-Vision Goggles for kids could easily be good enough for many adults. They feature 3X magnification and 4X digital zoom, an 850 nm infrared illuminator, and are capable of seeing more than 984 feet in complete darkness. Kids (and adults) still learning patience can view footage (up to an hour of 960p high-resolution video) directly on the goggles’ 2.31-inch TFT screen. The 25mm objective lens won’t let in as much detail as the larger lenses that you’ll find in the best night-vision goggles. That said, the affordable price tag also means you don’t have to get too worked up if your kid breaks them—the IP56 rating offers only limited protection against water and dust.   Why it made the cut: A quality budget monocular that offers high-price features at a fraction of the cost. Specs Pros Cons The CREATIVE XP Digital Night Vision Monocular is one of the best cheap night-vision devices you can buy, letting you see up to 650 feet ahead with a 25mm objective lens. An LED illuminator provides clear vision even in complete darkness—no ambient light required. It also allows you to take photos, record soundless video, and play back what you’ve captured. It comes with a USB cable and a 32 GB microSD card, but it can handle microSD cards up to 128 GB. Best of all, at just over 10 ounces, it’s highly portable for on-the-go use. NVGs work by amplifying the small amount of visible light present after the sun goes down to create images that your eye can see. They rely on complicated technology that turns light into electrical current before turning it back into visible light—much like old televisions. Complicated, too, is deciding between the best night-vision goggles. Here are some of the main features to consider.    Night sight comes in different forms: goggles, binoculars, and monoculars. Night-vision goggles go over both eyes and can be mounted to your head. But unlike night-vision binoculars, pure night-vision goggles offer no magnification. Night-vision monoculars are used with just one eye and are, therefore, more compact than the other two options. So binoculars are best if you want to see objects farther away, monoculars are best if you need to keep weight down in your pack, and NVGs are best if you’re looking for night sight that’s easy to use, especially when on the move.     The best night-vision goggles are made in four generations of technology, numbered 1 through 4. Generation 1 is the oldest and the cheapest, and they are still the most common for hobbyists. On the other hand, military NVGs are made with generations 2 and above and can also cost 10 times as much as Gen 1 technology—though such models are still available for public sale.  The main difference lies in the strength of the light amplification. While Gen 1 tops out at about 900 times the light gain, Gen 2 and above can reach 30,000 times the light gain. Gen 1 also offers lower resolution images—1,000 compared to more than 5,000, meaning Gen 2 and above gives you images with more clarity, especially at greater distances. Gen 2 and above also work better in lower-light situations since they have more than 240 UA/lm light sensitivity, compared to Gen 1, which tops out at that rating. Gen 3 is currently used by many U.S. military units since it features more than 300 yards of range, more than 10,000 hours of use, and a ton of versatility as it can be used with scopes, camera adapters, and magnification lenses. Gen 4 offers benefits like faster adaptation to shifting light, but it’s not otherwise widely viewed as a huge advancement over Gen 3. The next innovation in night vision will likely be augmented reality. Thermal night vision is another means of seeing images in the dark. Rather than converting light into electrical current and amplifying that signal, thermal goggles detect heat, providing outlines of the world based on what’s hot and cold. That means when you use infrared goggles, the deer you’re tracking will stand out in bright red and orange against the cold blue of the night. Thermal goggles are best in extremely low-light situations, where there truly isn’t any light to be amplified. Some of the best night-vision goggles are also cameras, letting you capture footage and save it, rather than just viewing everything in real-time. If you’re hoping to take pictures of owls or video of the northern lights, you definitely want night goggles that can also capture content. Many such night goggles come with 32GB SD cards for storing files. Other NVGs have built-in LCD screens that let you watch what you’ve captured on the goggles themselves, without having to transfer any files.  Night vision goggles can start at around $100 and can go up to $4,000 if they’re military-grade.  Yes, night-vision goggles really work. They let you see objects in total darkness, even if those objects are football fields ahead of you. Night-vision goggles work by converting the small amount of light photons that are present at night into electrical current and amplifying those electrons before converting them back into visible light. Thermal goggles detect heat energy, letting you see the shapes of images, even in situations where there truly is no light—like in a smoky building. Night-vision goggles cannot see through walls, however. And the majority are not built for daytime use—doing so can cause internal and external damage to the NVR.  Night vision is so expensive for a number of reasons. One reason is the high manufacturing costs for technology that can turn nearly invisible light into something visible or for technology that can read heat. Relatively low demand is another reason for the higher prices. In addition, many manufacturers have expensive contracts for making military NVGs, thus driving up the price point. You can find affordable options, though they may come with fewer bells and whistles. Yes, as there are no laws or regulations regarding owning them. However, you can’t take military-grade or tactical models out of the country without approval from the U.S. State Department.  The best night-vision goggles can let you see after dark in a whole new light. If you’re looking for military precision, you’ll need a pair of enhanced night-vision goggles with advanced technology that can amplify low levels of light by the tens of thousands. But that technology will also cost you thousands of dollars. For a factor of ten less, you can find night goggles that’ll sufficiently brighten the campsite or your view from the hunting stand. Ultimately, finding the best night-vision goggles comes down to how well you need to be able to see and how much you want to spend. is a Boston University journalism graduate with more than a decade of professional newspaper and magazine experience.
