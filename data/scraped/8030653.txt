Samlal is Founder and CEO of PayGroup Limited. In this role, he oversaw large scale successful merger and acquisition activity, including the recent sale of PayGroup Limited to Deel, resulting in PayGroup Limited delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in November 2022.   As a valuable source of counsel for PaySauce over the years, Samlal’s openness to sharing experiences helped shape PaySauce’s acquisition of SmoothPay in June 2021.   Commenting on the appointment, Mark said, “I’ve known PaySauce’s CEO and co-founder, Asantha, for quite some time and was delighted when he asked me to join the Board of Directors. I’ve been admiring the achievements PaySauce has made to date, and I’m impressed with the opportunities ahead. I’m excited to help shape the future of the company and ensure PaySauce’s growth trajectory continues.”   CEO Asantha Wijeyeratne said, “The team and I are incredibly excited to have Mark join our Board of Directors. The timing is impeccable with us beginning our journey into Australia. Mark is well connected and respected in the industry, and attracting someone of his caliber is hugely humbling”   An image of Mark Samlal is included in the attached pdf.   ABOUT PAYSAUCE   PaySauce is a SaaS fintech platform providing solutions for people at work in 14 jurisdictions across the Asia-Pacific region.
