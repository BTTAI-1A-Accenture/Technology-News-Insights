Maldives




The Island Spa at Four Seasons Resort Maldives at Kuda Huraa has launched a new therapeutic arts menu, comprising Acupuncture, Cupping, Moxibustion, Physiotherapy and Reflexology.The treatment is administered by Resident Acupuncturist and Physiotherapist Dinesh Man Lahke, who studied acupuncture in his native Nepal along with cupping and reflexology. Lahke is also qualified in moxibustion (a complement to acupuncture) and has a physiotherapy degree under his belt.Harbouring a unique understanding of the body and determination to help rid people of pain, Lahke brings relief and ease to debilitating conditions, including musculoskeletal or postural-related pain, sciatica, headaches, disc compression injuries, frozen shoulder, or post-traumatic stress disorder through the therapeutic powers of five healing arts.Opt for a “pure” session in one of Lahke’s five areas of expertise or follow his blended approach, which incorporates two or more modalities.
