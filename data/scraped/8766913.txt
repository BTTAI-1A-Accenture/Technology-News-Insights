 Get ready to meet the first guest ‚Äî our CHRO Alena (Helen Glad)! She embarked on a thrilling journey, swapping her cozy corner of the world for the sunny shores of California.  While California has a reputation as a dreamy paradise, the reality of moving to another country is far from easy. So it's time to explore the challenges Alena faced and the valuable lessons she learned along the way.    Question 1: "What were some unexpected challenges you faced during the relocation process. How did you overcome them?" I knew that I would miss my family and friends when I moved to the other side of the world. So I made plans to visit them once every six months or a year. However, I didn't expect that I wouldn't be able to go back home due to the crisis and then war in Ukraine, as it poses risks. Since 2021, I have only been home once, and I no longer make plans to visit. It breaks my heart. Question 2: "What advice would you give to someone who is about to move to a new country?" Question 3: "Tell us about a favorite local place, activity or tradition you discovered in your new country." I‚Äôve always loved walking and being in nature. Here you can find beautiful trails just a 10-20 minute drive from home. Whether it's walking through the forest among giant sequoias or along the ocean coastline, there are paths everywhere, with no litter and few people. And the best part is encountering wildlife: deer, coyotes, and sea lions. Moreover, my complex has pools, so I can go and swim or sunbathe alone in the morning on weekends or after 4 p.m. on weekdays. Question 4: "Looking back, how has moving to a new country changed you as a person? What valuable life lessons have you gained from the experience?" I have come to have a completely different attitude towards immigrants. Now I truly appreciate the magnitude of their achievement ‚Äî to detach themselves from a familiar and beloved place and step into the unknown. I express my respect to all who have made that decision. Moreover, I have always known that learning is a lifelong process, but moving to a new country is like diving into an ocean of information and stress.  Which country should we feature next in our relocation series? Is there something specific you've always wondered about?
