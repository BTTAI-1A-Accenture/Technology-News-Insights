In a world where sustainability and environmental consciousness are becoming increasingly important, Le’Marqunita Lowe stands at the forefront, championing the cause of sustainable fashion and re-education. As the CEO and founder of Black and Crème, a Black-owned and woman-owned online retail boutique, she has created a platform that showcases sustainable designers, small businesses, and fair-trade organizations. Moreover, she actively promotes economic and environmental re-education through social media channels, aiming to create awareness and diversity within the sustainable fashion ecosystem.  Lowe's journey towards sustainable fashion and clean beauty started with her love for nature and the cosmos. Growing up in marginalized neighborhoods where sustainable fashion was a rarity, she became acutely aware of the lack of representation for Black-owned designers and minority local businesses within the sustainable fashion industry. Inspired to make a change, she launched her own handmade vegan cosmetics company, "Mercury III." However, Lowe's ambitions did not stop there. With the establishment of Black and Crème, Lowe sought to open doors for all sustainable designers, small businesses, and Black-owned enterprises to sell their products on a retail platform that embraces the principles of sustainability, equitable economics, and cultural diversity. She believes that fashion should be aligned with the Earth, acknowledging the connection to the Motherland Africa, indigenous land, and people from all walks of life.  At its core, Black and Crème is more than just a retail boutique. It is a symbol of empowerment, supporting independent designers and local businesses while encouraging consumers to make informed choices about the products they buy. By curating a collection that includes jewelry and promoting eco-awareness through Black and Cream’s various social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube, Lowe aims to educate and inspire individuals to make conscious fashion choices that are not only stylish but also sustainable. Lowe's commitment to sustainability extends beyond her business ventures. As a PhD scholar in Interdisciplinary Studies at Union Institute and University, she is dedicated to furthering her knowledge and research in this field. Her upcoming book, a history textbook, is a testament to her desire to educate and re-educate individuals about the importance of sustainable practices in fashion.   Despite the challenges she faces as a last-year PhD scholar and entrepreneur, Lowe remains focused and organized. She believes that success lies not in the size of one's investment or capital, but rather in staying true to one's values, maintaining consistency, and cultivating loyal customer relationships. This philosophy has been the cornerstone of her journey as an entrepreneur and has allowed her to create a business that aligns with her passions and beliefs. Looking to the future, Lowe envisions a sustainable fashion industry that embraces diversity and inclusivity. She anticipates greater representation of people from different cultures and ethnicities in leadership roles within the retail sector and the sustainable fashion landscape. Through her efforts and the impact of Black and Crème, she aims to contribute to this transformative change. As a visionary, Lowe's dedication to sustainable fashion, her love for the Earth, and her commitment to empowering others make her an inspiration to aspiring entrepreneurs and advocates for change. She demonstrates that success can be achieved by staying true to oneself, following one's passions, and uplifting those around them.   In conclusion, Le’Marqunita Lowe's journey as an entrepreneur, author, and pageant queen has led her to become a force for positive change in the sustainable fashion industry. Through Black and Crème, she has created a platform that not only showcases sustainable fashion but also promotes economic and environmental re-education. With her unwavering commitment to diversity, equitable economics, and cultural awareness, Lowe is making a lasting impact on the fashion industry and the planet. As her journey continues, she strives to open a retail store for Black and Crème, further expanding her mission and empowering others to embrace sustainability with style. © 2024 Benzinga.com.
