The government of Armenia must immediately scrap any
attempt to legitimize internet shutdowns and attacks on
freedom of expression and opinion in the country. Through an
open
letter, Access Now and civil society are
demanding the proposed amendments to On the Legal Regime
of Martial Law that jeopardize human rights do not go
ahead.“The government of Armenia should be banning
internet shutdowns, not encouraging their use by
manipulating laws,” said Anastasiya Zhyrmont,
Campaigner for Eastern Europe & Central Asia at Access
Now. “It’s a lot more difficult to claw rights
back than have them snatched away. We must not allow
authorities the chance to oppress the
population.”These proposed amendments
and supplements to On the Legal Regime of
Martial Law, submitted by the Armenian Ministry of
Justice in December 2022, would grant the government, under
declaration of martial law, the power to restrict the right
to freedom of expression and opinion through temporary
blockings of websites, social media, internet applications,
and through partial or complete internet shutdowns across
the territory of the Republic of Armenia.These
changes could also facilitate other abuses towards members
of the media, including confiscating printing devices and
other equipment, setting special rules for using
communication devices, and a new procedure for accrediting
journalists.



“Internet shutdowns and targeted
blockings add to crises,” said Felicia Anthonio,
#KeepItOn Campaign Manager at Access Now. “During
conflict or turmoil, governments have a responsibility to
ensure access to information and communication. What we’re
witnessing in Armenia is the opposite.”This attempt
to restrict freedom of expression comes after censorship
last year, around the time of the 13
September military escalation at the
Azerbaijan-Armenia border, when authorities
in both countries deliberately interfered with
TikTok, making the popular app unavailable.
The government of Armenia also blocked several Azerbaijani
media outlets in Armenia.Read the open
letter.
