It seems Konami has some big plans for 2023, as producer Noriaki Okamura teased a “long-awaited” announcement in Famitsu’s yearly roundup of brief developer comments as a sneak preview of the year ahead (translated by Gematsu). “Other than [the educational edition of Momotaro Dentetsu announced last year], 2023 will be a year of many announcements! Stay tuned!” Okamura said. He also said his keyword for 2023 is “long-awaited.” Okamura previously worked on several Metal Gear games, including the original Metal Gear Solid, Peace Walker, and Metal Gear Solid V. It’s been nearly eight years since MGS V was released, and with “long-awaited” as his keyword, some fans naturally think Okamura is teasing the stealth game series’ return.  With Konami also bringing Silent Hill back in more ways than one, it seems a reasonable assumption to make as well. During the recent Silent Hill broadcast, Konami announced a remake and three brand-new projects for that franchise. However, a revival isn’t the only possibility. Okamura has worked on other franchises as well, including Contra and Frogger. The games-to-TV or film trend – or radio show, in Splinter Cell’s case – also shows no sign of slowing down in the near future, so Konami may have something along those lines planned for Metal Gear.
