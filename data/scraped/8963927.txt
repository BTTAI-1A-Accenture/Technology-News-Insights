SkyDrop is inspired by the user experience of Apple’s AirDrop feature for iOS and Mac and similar apps like WeTransfer: we have created a secure, private, FOSS (Free and Open Source) alternative for sharing text and uncompressed files with QR codes between mobile devices.

We are working on updated FAQs now that the Skynet Labs portals have shut down. The default portal in app now is https://web3portal.com/, please check their privacy policy when registering. We recommend using the new end-to-end encryption feature to secure your files so they could only be decrypted by their intended recipient.

SkyDrop is free software; your files are uploaded to your preferred Skynet portal. Files will usually be pinned for 30 days but to guarantee long term storage be sure to ask about plans with your portal provider.

This project is open source under MIT license. We built SkyDrop using .NET’s native cross-platform app framework Xamarin and MvvmCross framework.  New in V2
