The PSHCP is negotiated at the PSHCP Partners Committee, comprised of Employer, Bargaining Agent and pensioner representatives. Improvements that modernize the PSHCP were the result of successful negotiations amongst all parties and respond to the needs of a diverse Canadian public sector workforce, its retirees and dependants, while respecting the publicly funded nature of the benefits members receive.   Further details have now been included to explain how improvements and changes will be administered as of July 1, 2023. For a detailed overview of the entire plan, visit the PSHCP summary page.  The maximum reimbursement amounts for certain products and services have increased. The increased amounts will only be applicable to items or services acquired on or after July 1, 2023. For example, the annual benefit for massage therapy services has increased from $300 to $500. If a plan member submitted claims totaling $300 for services received before July 1, 2023, they will be eligible to claim an additional $200 for any services received after that date.
