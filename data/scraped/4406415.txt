Thatâs 100 per cent locked in. âAt the other end of the weekend on Sunday late afternoon/evening, Carlton v GWS at Marvel Stadium to finish Round 24. That could potentially be very interesting with top eight positions up for grabs. âIn between that there is still a bit to work through at the AFL. Geelong and the Western Bulldogs both believe their game will be Saturday night at GMHBA Stadium with Sunday 3:20pm as a Plan B. âHawthorn v Fremantle is a dead rubber on Saturday afternoon at the MCG, thatâs what it looks like.  âSydney v Melbourne, both clubs expect that to be Saturday afternoon or evening at the SCG. âPort Adelaide v Richmond is likely for Saturday at some stage rather than Sunday. âWeâre still waiting on all the answers, but I can confirm the bookends which will be Friday night Collingwood v Essendon and late Sunday at Marvel which will be Carlton v GWS.â The other Round 24 fixtures not mentioned are Brisbane v St Kilda (Gabba), North Melbourne v Gold Coast (Blundstone Arena) and West Coast v Adelaide (Optus Stadium).  The AFL is expected to release the Round 24 fixture as early as Monday.
