     Washington Times opinion editor Charlie Hurt discusses the report on how Instagram hasn't taken down hashtags related to child sex abuse on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’ A U.S. Capitol Police Department (USCP) officer was arrested and charged with child pornography possession on Monday morning, authorities said. Owings resident Jared Michael Lemon, 42, was charged with five counts of possession of child pornography. Maryland State Police officials arrested him without incident at his residence at around 5 a.m. on Monday morning. The months-long investigation began when authorities received a tip about Lemon's online activity. "The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force also received a cybertip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children that an online user, later identified as Lemon, had uploaded suspected child pornography," Maryland State Police explained in a statement.

He has worked for the USCP since 2005. State police executed a warrant at Lemon's residence in December 2022 and analyzed his electronic devices. The USCP was aware of the allegations at the time and reassigned him accordingly.
