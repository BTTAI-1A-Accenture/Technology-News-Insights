In order to be an ethical hacker, he must understand how computers work, be able to work with any operating systems (Windows, Mac, UNIX, and Linux), understand the underlying hardware platforms required, and be able to communicate with laypersons and other computer security professionals through correspondence and reports. â Which type of hacker uses their computer knowledge to invade the privacy of others, thereby breaking security laws and rendering the security of information systems weak? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: Black Hat hackers have no qualms about breaking the law and exploiting security systems to access the private and sensitive files. They build their knowledge base in computer security to break security laws and weaken the security of information systems. Hacker Classifications are as follows: Black Hat Hackers (Crackers): As previously mentioned, these hackers seek to gain access to private files and information by attacking information systems. Gray Hat Hackers: This is the âgray areaâ crowd. Sometimes they choose to defend an information system or network, and other times they put on their Black Hat and break laws to achieve their goals. White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers): These hackers have built their knowledge base in order to defend information systems. They use their computer skills to increase, rather than decrease, the security of networks. Security Providing Organizations: An organization or community that delivers computer security to networks and security systems. â What is true about vulnerability in computer security? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Vulnerability is defined as a weak spot or lack of safeguarding procedure(s) that could likely be exploited by one or more threats, causing damage to a network and/or information system. Vulnerabilities can be found in hardware, firmware, software, applications, system utility and configuration settings/files, and operating systems. A threat is simply the sign or indication of a possible negative event. A threat can be caused by a computer user or even through a natural occurrence. Unlike a threat, vulnerability is the agent that can or does exploit a weak point. â Which of the policies listed below is a valid set of rules regarding connecting a system to an internal network while physically in a different location? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: A companyâs remote access policy sets forth rules for connecting to an internal network remotely. A network security policy, conversely, is more general. It lays out the basic rules for accessing the computer network, describes how the rules will be enforced, and outlines the architecture of the network environment, including the security structure. A computer security policy delivers a definition of various aspects of a companyâs computer system and gives an outline of its goals. This ranges from a highly professional and formal document, to a relaxed and informal one. Security policies are enforced by organizational policies or security mechanisms. The user account policy document is one that lays out the means for someone to request an account and/or maintain an account on the computer systems or networks of an organization. â How can you establish that policies, configurations and procedural changes/updates are made in a controlled and well-documented environment? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. â Security, which is a measurement of how safe a system or network is for individuals and organizations, is the condition of well-being of information and infrastructure. With a secure system, theft (particularly undetected), tampering, and/or disruption (through Denial of Service Attacks) of services and information are limited to low or tolerable levels. Select the elements of security from the list below. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: All of the above. Breakdown: Elements of Security: Confidentiality: A bond of trust that involves refusing to reveal details about a company, product, resource, or any other sensitive and/or proprietary information. Authenticity: Proof of identity and origination of information. Integrity: The level of credibility, reliability and reputation of data and/or resources, particularly with regards to stopping unapproved or unauthorized alterations. Availability: The accessibility and ability to utilize information or resources when desired. Non-Repudiation: The inability of a sender to separate or disconnect him/herself via message. â Background: In her career as an Ethical Hacker, Diane has been assigned to a new project. She must test the security of a website. The only information that she is provided about the network infrastructure is as follows: Diagrams from the network infrastructure Names and source code for necessary security tools Details about the IP addresses of the network Based on the information provided above, what testing methodology is being implemented by the website? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: With the information Diane has been given, she determines that their website is using the white-box testing method. Itâs a technique whereby an organization delivers a complete picture of the infrastructure to the team testing its website. The testing technique known as âblack-boxâ is a blind situation where the team is given no information the infrastructure of the website or organization. This is the least desirable of techniques because it is a high cost, time-consuming and low ROI process. Gray-box testing is a mix between white-box and black-box techniques. In this methodology, the testing team is given some background of system and can design/implement their security systems based on at least some knowledge of the system. â How can gray box testing be distinguished from black box testing? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: In gray box testing, the attacker carries out attacks using just a normal user account to see if he can escalate privileges. White box testing is a security testing method that helps a security team to validate whether application implementation actually follows the intended design and security functionality. Additionally, the security team is responsible for uncovering exploitable vulnerabilities in white-box testing. Black box testing assumes no prior knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested. The testers must first determine the location and extent of the systems before commencing their analysis. â What core principle states that an individual or party cannot deny a role it had in an action or event (including document transmission)? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Microsoftâs print and file servers are among the more common targets for hackers. Which of the below is a commonâbut potentially harmfulâvulnerability? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. â Grace has made a career as an Ethical Hacker. Her company asks her to test the security of their server against potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In order to accomplish this, she sends ICMP ECHO packets en masse to a set computer. She is employing which of the below techniques against DoS attacks? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: In testing the security, Grace utilized the Ping Flood style of attack. Here, the attacker delivers a mass quantity of ICMP packets, bombarding to a target computer. The definitions for a Smurf DoS attack, a teardrop attack, and a land attack are as follows. A Smurf DoS attack is arranged when the attacker delivers a large quantity of ICMP âEcho requestsâ to IP broadcasting address or addresses. A spoofed address is used so as to mask the ICMP requests. A teardrop DoS attack involves a sequence of data packets that are directed to a target system or computer with overlapping, offset field values and over-sized payloads. The target computer or system will then not be able to reassemble the packets and must therefore hang, crash or reboot. A land DoS attack requires the attacker to send a hoax/spoofed TCP SYN packet where the target hostâs IP address is filled in in two places: the source field and the destination field. â There are many credos within the computer security world. Which of the below groups believes that a hackerâs purpose is to make social change, regardless of whether it involves breaking laws and/or defacing webpages? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Online hactivism has seen a great deal of growth lately. Hactivists believe that they can change society through their attacks. The act itself is called âHacktivism,â which is motivated by a political or social purpose. Hacktivists hack into a computer network or system for a âcauseââdefacing or bringing down a website as a statement for their beliefs. A hacktivist uses the same tools and methods as any other hacker. Script kiddies have very limited hacking skills and/or programming experience and use open source and free hacking software to perform elementary attacks. Crackers use their expertise in hacking and programming to carry out damaging and usually illegal activities. Phreakers only rip off information from communication systems. â Security teams should do which of the below to reduce attack surface? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. â In his profession as an Ethical Hacker, Chistov is often assigned jobs where he needs to test the security of a website. In this case, he is assigned to check the security of a new website. He canât remember what the first step is in malicious hacking, but he needs to know it in order to protect against hackers. What is the first step? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Here is the breakdown of phases in malicious hacking: Reconnaissance: Attacker collects details about their intended victim. Scanning: Attacker seeks out vulnerabilities, which they will later exploit. Gaining Access: Attacker uses the above-discovered vulnerability in order to access the network or system. Maintaining Access: Attacker keeps their system access long enough to complete the attack. Covering/Clearing Tracks: Attacker takes steps to avoid being discovered or penalized under the crimes code. â Adam is a malicious hacker who attacks a companyâs server. Once he has gotten in, he sets up a backdoor on the companyâs server and modifies the log files. Which of the above-discussed phases includes that modification? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Adam placed a backdoor on a companyâs server in order to ensure he has total at-will access. He maintains his access to the server in this manner. But Adam wasnât finished. After he placed the backdoor, he carefully modified the log files on the server to avoid detection. This malicious act could actually clue the Network Administrator into the hackerâs intentions and falls within the last step of the hackerâs processâcovering his tracks. â If two unique corporations or companies go through a merger, what should they do to make sure that the Certificate of one company would trust the Certificate generated by the other? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Which authority of PKI will verify an applicant? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â What is the definition of a script kiddie? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Answer B is actually the definition of a disgruntled employee. This kind of employee has lost the respect of his superiors and coworkers, and can be untrustworthy. Still, this kind of employee often is more educated and skilled than a script kiddie. â How is a penetration tester different from an attacker? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: A penetration test is a technique of evaluating security of a system or network by simulating attacks. This process requires an active analysis of the system/network for potential vulnerabilities resulting from poor or improper system configurations, known and/or unknown hardware or software flaws, and/or operational weaknesses in process or technical countermeasures. â What is the first thing an ethical hacker must do before running a pentest? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. â What are some end objectives of an effective pentesting attempt? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: For a successful penetration test that meets a clientâs expectations, a clear definition of goals is absolutely essential. If goals are not easily attainable, the tester should notify his client in the preparation phase and recommend alternative procedures (IT audit or IT security consulting services). â Penetration tests occur in phasing. Recall from a previous question the terms âdata gatheringâ and reconnaissance. During which phase(s) do these two actions occur? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: The first step is the pre-attack phase, where the penetration tester seeks out data about their target. Otherwise known as reconnaissance, the data collection stage is important because it is the foundation on which the rest of the attack is built. The attacker then gathers all of the data, from scanning Whois, DNS, and any and all networks they can discover. The attacker maps out the network and soon has in front of him a total picture, including the operating system and what applications are currently running on any one of the systems. â Which of the below tools (based in Linux) can be used for penetration testing? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. â The PCI-DSS requires organization to perform external pentests. How often will this organization need to be done? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â What method is the most widespread method for an attacker to find victims for social engineering strikes? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Surprisingly enough phone attacks are one of the most common social engineering attacks. What exactly is social engineering? Itâs a way of conning people into divulging their personal and financial information, account logins, pin numbers and passwords by earning their trust. Sometimes war driving is referred to as access point mapping. This is when a hacker undertakes to find exploitable connections through locating wireless networks while driving. Session hijacking refers to the abuse/unauthorized use of a computer session in search of private and/or proprietary information available on a computer system. This word is most often used to refer to the illicit theft of a âmagic cookieâ used to allow a user to login via remote server. TCP session hijacking occurs when a hacker seizes a TCP session between two machines that have already connected. This allows the hacker to skip past the initial authentication checks and achieve access to a computer system or network. â Jay is using Facebook, Twitter, and other social networking sites to gather information on his targets. What sort of methods is he employing? (Select 2.) Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 5 and 6. â A tester detects an access point via WPA2 during a routine wireless penetration test.

Where should you go to enable them? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. â A pentester (otherwise known as a penetration tester) keys in the below command. What kind of scan is this? nmap -N -sS -PO -p 123 192.168.2.25 Show answer and Breakdown Answer:  The correct answer is 3. â If a hacker wanted to modify prices on a website, which of the below methods would they use? As an aside, there are no alerts shown through IDS. Show answer and Breakdown Answer:  The correct answer is 2. â What kind of a scan delivers specially designed packets to a system (remote) and then analyzes the output? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Background: You run the following command in the command prompt: Telnet IP Address Port 80 HEAD /HTTP/1.0 Return Return Which of the below of information collection methods did you use? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Banner grabbing is a type of enumeration/inventory technique utilized by hackers to extract information about computers and/or hosts on a network and determining which services are active on its open ports. A port is a medium of communication between two separate systems. A port, a unique 16-bit code/number, distinguishes each service on any host. This can be used by hackers or by an administrator to perform an inventory check for their network. OS Fingerprinting is the simplest and most straightforward way to discover which operating system is being used on a remote system. This kind of detection makes it much easier to hack a system. Fingerprinting compares data packets, which are sent by a target system. There are two categories of fingerprinting methods: Active fingerprinting Passive fingerprinting With active fingerprinting, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages are pushed to the target system. Ordinarily, remote systemâs response message will reveal the operating system. In passive fingerprinting, the hacker uses a âsnifferâ such as Wireshark to capture traffic, analyzing the number of hops to discover the operating system. In passive fingerprinting, no traffic is sentâit is only collected. Dumpster diving refers to rummaging through an individualâs waste/trash, including discarded mail, in an attempt to discover important or private information. The first step in learning the specifics of the open ports on any system is port scanning. Hackers utilize port scanning to locate a âhackableâ network or server with an easily detectable weakness, hole, or vulnerability. â Which of the below techniques cannot be used to perform active OS fingerprinting? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 1 and 4 are correct. These are the ways to perform passive OS fingerprinting. Email header passive OS fingerprinting: In this method an attacker uses the e-mail header to detect the remote OS. It (the header) is analyzed and gives information about the mail daemon of the remote computer. Each OS uses a special mail daemon, so an attacker can then figure out the OS. The other options, ICMP error message quoting, sending FIN packets to open ports on a remote system, are active forms of fingerprinting for the OS. â Which of the below types of privacy invasion involves modifying data or information before or during input into a computer system with the intent to steal or commit fraud? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Data diddling involves altering data prior to or during input to a computer in an attempt to commit fraud. It also is used to describe the act of deliberately changing information, programs, and/or documentation. Eavesdropping is the act of snooping/listening in on private conversations. This is also the term used to describe attackers watching and analyzing network traffic. Spoofing is a method used by hackers to make a transmission seem to have originated from a familiar or authentic source by faking IP addresses, email addresses, and caller ID. In IP spoofing, a hacker will tweak packet headers by inserting someone elseâs IP address to mask their identity. However, spoofing is not functional for surfing the web or chatting online because the responses will be misdirected by the false IP address. Hackers use wiretapping to monitor phone and Internet communications where they are not a party. Wiretapping is actually legal, but ONLY with prior consent. Police officials and governmental authorities regularly utilize âlegalized wiretappingâ to in relation to investigations, whether public or secret. â Molly is employed as an Ethical Hacker. Her newest project involves testing the security of a website. Which of the below are the three pre-testing phases of an attack used in measuring the security of this website? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 6, 1 and 3. Breakdown: These are the three pre-testing phases used in the attack: (f) Footprinting (a) Identifying an active system (c) Enumerating a system â Which of the below will record everything a user types using a keyboard connected to the machine it is installed within? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: A firewall is a utility that is used to protect an internal network or intranet against unauthorized access via the Internet or other external networks. A firewall sets restrictions on access (inbound and outbound) and performs analysis on traffic (between the network and the Internet). If installed, a keystroke logger or keylogger will log and record everything a person types using their keyboard. Both hardware and software forms of keyloggers exist. A port scanner is a software utility designed to search a network host for any open ports. It is useful to security teams performing security checks on their networks. However, it is also very useful to hackers targeting a network and its systems. â Background: Placing backdoors, web server hacking and session hijacking are among the phases of executing attacks. From the below list, which, if any, of these tools can be used to obscure identity? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 2, 3 and 4 are correct. Breakdown: It is possible to mask your identity using firewalls (such as IPChains), a proxy server, or through an anonymizer. A proxy server conceals the identity-related details of a userâs machine, network, or system from others. The userâs system first establishes a direct connection with a proxy server, and then that server then creates a connection with a remote host of the userâs choice. Anonymizers help make a userâs web surfing anonymous by removing any identifying details/information from a userâs computer system while the user browses the Internet. This helps to secure the userâs privacy. Linux IPChains is free software that controls the filter and firewall capabilities on a Linux operating system. Network Administrators use it to ACCEPT, DENY, MASQ, or REDIRECT packets. The kernel starts with three sets of rules, or chains, in the firewall as follows: input, output, and forward. Note: Each packet (which may come from an Ethernet card or otherwise) that passes through the forward chain will also pass through the input and output chains. A war dialer is a utility used by hackers to detect vulnerable modems; war dialers scan hundreds or thousands of phone numbers looking to discover an unauthorized way into the system. The tools available for this act are innumerable: a few include PhoneSweep, THC-Scan, and ToneLoc. A rootkit is a toolkit or group of tools that can allow a hacker to seize administrative control of a computer system with no authorization. A rootkit does require root access to be installed onto the Linux operating system, but once it has been installed, the hacker has unlimited at-will root access. â Which of the below tools can be used for footprinting? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 2, 3 and 4. Breakdown: The traceroute, Sam spade, and whois utilities are useful for footprinting. What is the SAM SPADE utility? SAM SPADE is a software tool for discovering sources of email spam. It is named after a fictional private detective who unflinchingly sought out justice. The tool itself can request a DNS server to send back details about a domain, scan IP addresses for open ports, find the route of a packet transmitting between a machine and a remote system, and guess the origin of emails from their headers. It can also decode masked URLs. What is the TRACEROUTE utility? The TRACEROUTE utility will display the path of a specific IP packet. Traceroute uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo packets, displaying the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as well as the IP address for any gateway along the route to its remote host. â Markus works as an Ethical Hacker. His main project is to test the security of his clientâs website. He starts by performing footprinting and scanning. What does this entail? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: 1, 2, 3 and 4 are correct. Breakdown: In the enumeration phase, an attacker collects information and data, including the network user and group names, routing tables, and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) data. The methods utilized in this phase are listed below: Obtaining Active Directory details and identifying vulnerable accounts Discovering NetBIOSnames Employing Windows DNSqueries Establishing NULLsessions and queries â Which of the below techniques uses a modem in order to automatically scan a list of telephone numbers? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: War dialing uses a modem to auto-scan a list of phone numbers, often dialing each number in a local area code to search for computers, BBS systems and fax machines. Hobbyists can use this technique for exploration, and crackers (hackers specializing in computer security) to guess passwords. Warchalking is drawing symbols in public places to guerilla advertise an open Wi-Fi wireless network. The warchalker finds a Wi-Fi node and then draws a special symbol somewhere nearby. This is a portmanteau of the cracker terms war dialing + war driving. â As Database Manager for a local company, Mick has a lot of responsibilities. He decides to set up remote control software on his work machine so that he will be able to login from home or otherwise. After installing the connection, he connects a modem to an otherwise-unused fax line. With no authentication to enable him to set a password for a host connection to the remote connection, Mickâs remote connection will be accessible to for anyone to connect to his host system. Which of the below attacks can be performed on Mickâs remote connection? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Which of the below is a passive, non-direct information-gathering tool? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: The whois tool is a so-called âpassiveâ information-gathering utility. These kinds of queries can be used to discover the IP address ranges linked to a client or clients. A whois query can be run in most UNIX environments. With Windows, the whois tools, including WsPingPro and/or Sam Spade, will to do whois queries. Whois queries can be executed online via www.arin.net or at www.networksolutions.com. Nmap is an active information-gathering tool. The nmap utility, or port scanner, is used to directly view open ports on a Linux system. Administrators can determine which of the services are currently available for external users. Snort is more than just a character in a P.D. Eastman book. This tool is an active information-gathering utility. Snort is open source and designed for network intrusion prevention, as well as detection; Snortâs system also operates as a network sniffer and records network activity matched with predefined signatures. Three primary Snort modes are listed below: Sniffermode: In this mode, snort will find the packets throughout the network and display them on the console in a continuous stream. Packetlogger mode: This is the mode where packets are logged to the disk. Network intrusion detection mode: This mode offers the most options for configuration, and it also allows users to filter network traffic using their own sets of rules. Like nmap and Snort, Ettercap is an active information-gathering tool. Ettercap, a UNIX and Windows-based tool for computer network protocol analysis and security audits, can intercept traffic on a network subnet/segmentâthereby capturing user passwords and conducting active surveillance against â When determining which services are active on a target machine as well as possible entry points to attack, which of the below would you use? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Chuck needs to perform a basic vulnerability scan using Nmap. When dealing with protocols like FTP and HTTP, what key engine does Nmap utilize? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. â While running an Nmap scan for filtered ports, you send an ACK flag and receive a RST packet for open and closed ports. What kind of Nmap scan did you run? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: The TCP ACK Scan will not discover open and closed portsâit will determine whether or not a port is filtered or unfiltered. When an ACK flag is sent, Open/Closed ports will return RST. Any ports that do not respond are considered filtered. Conversely, with a NULL Scan, no flags are set on a packet. The target must follow RFC 793, a TCP specification. If the port is open or filtered, it will receive no response. If the port is closed, it will receive RST. In Fin Scan, a Fin flag is set on a packet. Again, the target must follow RFC 793. If a port is open or filtered, it will receive no response; yet it will receive RST if a port is actually closed. In XMAS Scan, the FIN, URG, and PSH flags are set on a packet. The target must still follow RFC 793. It will receive no response if a port is open or filtered and will receive RST if a port is closed. Reference: http://nmap.org/ â Which of the below Nmap commands is used to perform a UDP port scan? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The nmap -sU command performs a UDP port scan. The nmap -sS command performs stealth scanning. The nmap -sF command performs FIN scanning. The nmap -sN command performs TCP NULL port scanning. â Which Nmap switch would you use to retrieve as many different protocols as possible that are being used by a remote host? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The nmap -sO switch is used to scan IPs. To search additional IP protocols, you can utilize the IP protocol scan. Such protocols include ICMP, TCP and UDP. This scan will unearth uncommon IP protocols that could be active on a system. Nmap will not allow you to combine the verbose and OS scanning options. It will display the below error message: Invalid argument to -v: âOâ The nmap -sT switch performs a TCP full scan. The nmap -sS is performs a TCP half scan. Here an attacker will send a SYN packet to a target port. â Which of the below represents the type of packet inspection used by a firewall when scanning the DMZ interface on a firewall Nmap reports that port 80 is unfiltered? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â As a contracted Ethical Hacker, Al has recently contracted to complete a project to do security checking on a website.

The tool analyzes raw IP packets to discover the following: â¢ Which ports are open on the network systems? â¢ Which hosts are available on the network? â¢ Are there unauthorized wireless access points? â¢ Which services (application name, version) are the available hosts providing? â¢ Which operating systems (and OS versions) are the hosts running? â¢ Which types of packet filters/firewalls are being utilized? Based on the above information, which of the below tools is Luke using? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: Nmap is an active data collection tool. The port-scanning ability of the nmap utility can be the open ports on a Linux machine. Administrators can employ this tool to discover which services are accessible to external users. â Which of the below utilities is a protocol analyzer with the ability to capture packet traffic as it comes into the network (âin real timeâ)? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Wireshark is a protocol analyzer with the ability to capture packet traffic as it comes into the network (âin real timeâ). It is free and open source, and will act as a packet sniffer, capturing network traffic for purposes of troubleshooting, development of software/communications protocol, analysis, and as a teaching tool. It was originally called Ethereal. Wireshark will work on Windows, Mac, Linux, or Unix machines. â Wireshark will excel in which one of the below situations you might face as an Ethical Hacker? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: When a device is a hub, it is convenient for capturing through Wireshark. A hub based on switches will only transmit âcleanâ packetsâwhereas a real hub will simply act as a repeater with no verification of packets. Network hubs do not manage network traffic. Therefore, each packet that enters a port is repeated on every other port. A switch learns and maintains a table of MAC addresses. A switch does not simply forward all packets to all other ports, but rather uses a bridge to determine which packets are forwarded to which ports. â You need to obtain a packet capture for a network. Which of the below devices would allow you to capture a total picture of the traffic on the wire through Wireshark? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â Steve 2. is a black hat and wishes to run a port scan on a machine he is attacking to try to find some open ports and other valuable information.

You visit the companyâs website and analyze its contents and conclude that they are looking for professionals who possess a strong knowledge of Windows Server 2003 and Windows active directory installations. Which of the below hacking phase(s) does this fall under? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â When a match for an alert rule is found in Snort, the intrusion detection system carries out which of the below actions? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. â Background: Anonymizers are used to mask a userâs web surfing. Anonymizers work by removing all identifying information from a computer throughout the time the user is surfing online. Internet users seeking privacy will use an anonymizer. Once they have enabled online access anonymization, each link they open for the remainder of the session will also be accessed anonymously, with no extra actions on the part of the user. However, anonymizers do have limitations. Which of the below represent examples of such limitations? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: All of the above are correct. Breakdown: These are the limitations of anonymizers: Secure protocols including âHTTPSâ: will not be anonymized correctly by an anonymizer because a browser must be able access the site directly in order to maintain truly secure encryption. Third-party plugins accessed by websites cannot be properly anonymized. There is simply no way to ensure that any independent direct connection between the userâs machine and a remote site will remain established. When a Javaapplication is accessed via an anonymizer, it cannot circumvent a Java security wall. ActiveXapplications will have nearly unlimited access to the computer system of the user. The JavaScript language will be disabled with anonymizers that are URL-based. â Which of the below is true about the TCP/IP model? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2 and 4. Breakdown: As a description framework used in computer network protocols, the TCP/IP model sets forth the design guidelines in a general sense as well as the specific networking protocol implementation. This creates a way for computers to interface via network connections. TCP/IP does provide end-to-end connectivity, and also delineates the way in which data must be formatted, as well as addressed, transmitted and routed, and even the way it will be received. There are various protocols for communication services to and from computers. Another name used for this model is the Internet model or the DoD model (this is because it was created by the Department of Defense). There are four unique layers in the TCP/IP model. This is represented in the below image. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) maintains the TCP/IP model and other related protocols. In another model, the OSI Reference Model, there are actually seven (7) layers. The TCP/IP model has fewer steps because it allows applications to manage actions past a certain layer. The Application Layer (or Layer 4) Programs communicate through application layers. Think of it as a âuser interface layer.â Through application layers, browser, file-sharing software, email software, and other user-facing (the user interacts with the software directly) software can interact. Other aspects handled in this layer include encryption and session details. The Transport Layer (or Layer 3) In the transport layer, devices will negotiate to determine how to talk to each other over a network. This involves such decisions as communication type (e.g., User Diagram Protocol or Transmission Control Protocol), the window size, which port, how to deal with errors, as well as sequencing. Most work done in device communications is completed through this layer. The Internet Layer (or Layer 2) The Internet Layer is where IP addressing, internetworking (connecting one network with others through gateways), and path determination occur. The path that a packet will take through a network is handled in this layer through routers. The protocols in this layer will examine multiple avenues to determine the most efficient way for one host to connect to the other. The Link Layer (or Layer 1) The link layer is responsible for encapsulating the data. The network type will determine which way this layer accomplishes it taskâwhich encapsulation protocol is appropriate. Some of them include Ethernet, Frame Relay, PPP, HDLC or CDP. The physical connection between the devices (as well as the topology of the network) plays a major part in the selection. Regarding answer C above: this option is invalid, as the TCP/IP model consists of not five (5) or seven (7) abstraction layers, but a total of four (4). â Phil needs to procure information related to a server with an IP address range that is within the IP address range that is used in Brazil. There are many registries available online for discovering the details of web server IP addresses, or reverse Domain Name Service (DNS) lookup. Which of the below registries will be most useful to him? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Phil needs to obtain information about a web server situated in Brazil. Registries are available throughout the world, most often broken up into geographic locations. So the Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry, or LACNIC, is the Regional Internet Registry for the Latin American and Caribbean regions and is therefore the best registry for doing a DNS lookup. LACNIC is one of five (5) regional Internet registries available worldwide. Its chief purpose is to assign and administrate IP addresses for the region of Latin America and parts of the Caribbean. The RÃ©seaux IP EuropÃ©ens Network Coordination Centre, or RIPE NCC, is the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for Europe, the Middle East, and certain parts of Central Asia. The Asia Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC), Regional Internet Registry for the Asia Pacific region, assigns and administers numerical resource allocation as well as registration services to support the global operation of the Internet The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for Canada, parts of the Caribbean, some North Atlantic islands, and the United States. â Routing protocols are used to show how computers communicate. From the below options, select the two routing protocols. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 2 and 4. â Which of the below is a good definition the principle of least privilege?

Erik is currently working with the advanced features of a Windows firewall in order to block/prevent a client machine from responding to any pings. Which of the below advanced setting types will require modification? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: According to the scenario, Erik must modify the settings related to the Internet Control Message Protocol, or ICMP. ICMP is a protocol used when PING commands are issued and received, as well as when a ping is being responded to. This is an important part of IP that is used to report errors in datagram processing. A datagram is a basic transfer unit that is associated with packet-switched networks, an independent entity of data that carries enough information to be routed from its source to a destination computer. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP-25) is a protocol that sends e-mail messages between servers. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP-161) allows a router, switch, or other monitored device to run an SNMP agent. This protocol enables the management of multiple network devices from a remote workspace. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is generally used for âone-to-manyâ communications, through broadcast and/or multicast IP datagrams. This protocol does not guarantee delivery or verify sequencing for any datagram because it is a connection-less and often unreliable communication protocol. However, UDP provides faster transmission of data between TCP/IP hosts than TCP. â Background: When data provided to a caching name server that has not originated from a non-authentic source (in other words, a DNS source), this is called DNS cache poisoning. Once a DNS server receives this non-authentic data and caches it for future performance increases, it will be considered âpoisonedâ because it will thereafter supplying server clients with that non-authentic data. In order to determine the end-time for DNS cache poisoning, which of the below DNS records should you examine? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: A start of authority (SOA) record contains information about the DNS zone on which it is stored and about other DNS records. A DNS zone is the area of a domain that is within the responsibility of a specific DNS server. There is only one SOA record for each DNS. As stated above, when data is provided to a DNS serve that did not originate from authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) sources (whether due to intentional or unintentional circumstances) it is called DNS Cache poisoning. To perform such an attack, the attacker discovers and takes advantage of a flaw in the DNS software. A server must correctly validate DNS responses have originated from an authentic source, or the server may end up caching incorrect entries locally and inevitably deliver them to users whom key in identical requests. Also called a âmail exchanger record,â an MX is also stored in the zone file of Domain Name Server (DNS). The MX record associates a domain name to another domain name sorted within an address record (an âAâ record). A name server record, or NS record, establishes the server that is considered an authoritative server for the DNS zone. The pointer record (PTR), is housed on the Domain Name System (DNS) database responsible for mapping an IP address to a specific host name on the in-addr.arpa domain. These records are used when performing reverse DNS lookups. â Which of the below items is a straightforward example of two-factor authentication?

The code is written in Java and his team lead wants to it for buffer overflow vulnerabilities using the SAINT scanning tool. Why should Ian discourage his team lead from this avenue? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: Because Java uses a sandbox to isolate code, it is not vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. Most web, application servers and web application environments are actually susceptible to buffer overflows. However, environments written in interpreted languages such as Java or Python are a notable exception. They are immune to these attacks (except for overflows within an Interpreter). â Scott, a professional Ethical Hacker, has been assigned to do security and vulnerability testing for an organization. In order to find out whether certain computers are connected to the server or not, he will need to ping about 500 computers. Which of the below techniques would save him time and energy? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: The Ping sweeping technique allows you to ping a batch of devices and get the list of active devices. It is a tedious task to ping every address on the network, the ping sweeping technique is highly recommended. The ping command-line utility tests connectivity with a host on a TCP/IP-based network by sending a series of packets to a destination host. â How can an attacker discover what rules have been set up on a specific gateway? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The Firewalking technique can help a hacker learn which rules have been set up on a gateway. Packets are ordinarily sent to a remote host with the exact TTL of a target. Hping2 be used for firewalking as well. â What is the process of identifying hosts or services by sending packets into the network perimeter to see which ones get through?

Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: SuperScan is a TCP/UDP port scanner that works as a ping sweeper and hostname resolver as well. Given a range to ping, it will resolve the host name of a remote system. â Which is the correct sequence of packets needed to perform the 3-way handshake method? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The TCP/IP 3-way handshake method is used by the TCP protocol to establish a connection between a client and the server. It involves three steps: In the first step of the three-way handshake method, a SYNmessage is sent from a client to the server. In the second step of the three-way handshake method, SYN/ACKis sent from the server to the client. In the third step of the three-way handshake method, ACK(usually called SYN-ACK-ACK) is sent from the client to the server. At this point, both the client and server have received an acknowledgment of the TCP â In which of the below scanning methods do Windows operating systems send only RST packets irrespective of whether the port is open or closed? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: In the TCP FIN scanning method, Windows sends only RST packets whether or not the port is open. TCP FIN scanning is a type of stealth scanning where the attacker sends a FIN packet to the target port. If the port is closed, the victim assumes that this packet was sent mistakenly by the attacker and sends the RST packet to the attacker. â In which of the below methods does a hacker send SYN packets followed by a RST packet? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: In a TCP SYN scan, an attacker will send SYN packets followed by a RST packet. This is also known as half-open scanning because a full TCP connection is never opened. Steps of TCP SYN scanning: Send a SYNpacket to a target port. If it is open, you will receive a SYN/ACK Send an RSTpacket to break the connection. If an RSTpacket has been received, it indicates that a port is closed. Xmas scans: In Xmas Tree scanning, multiple flags (at least FIN, URG and PSH) will be adde4. If a target port is open, the service running on that target port will discard the packets without sending a reply. According to specification RFC 793, when a port is closed, a remote system will reply with the RST packet. â The attacker works through a spoofed IP address to send a SYN packet to a target. Which of the below methods did the attacker choose? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: In the IDLE scan method, an attacker delegates sending the SYN packet (to a target) to a spoofed IP address. The IDLE scan is initiated with a third partyâs IP address and therefore this is the only totally stealth scan technique. This makes it very difficult to detect the hacker, since the IDLE scan uses a different address from the attackerâs own. What is a sequence number? A sequence number is a 32-bit number ranging from 1 to 4,294,967,295. Data sent over a network is broken into packets at the source and then reassembled at a destination system once it arrives. Each packet includes a sequence number used by the destination system to reassemble the data packets correctly upon arrival. When a system boots, it has an initial sequence number (ISN). As each second passes, the ISN will be incremented by 128,000. When the system connects and establishes a connection with another system, the ISN will be incremented by 64,000. For example, if a host has an ISN 1,254,332,454 and the host sends one SYN packet, the ISN value will be incremented by 1: Therefore, the new ISN will be 1,254,332,455. Conditions Increment in the ISN Value Transfer of SYN packet 1 Transfer of FIN packet 1 Transfer of ACK packet 0 Transfer of SYN/ACK packet 1 Transfer of FIN/ACK packet 1 Passage of 1 second 128,000 Establishment of one connection 64,000 â Which of the below scanning methods is most accurate and reliable, with the downside being that it is also incredibly easy to detect?

How will you get around the firewall? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 1 and 2 are correct. Breakdown: HTTP tunneling refers to the technique of using various network protocols to perform communications, which are then encapsulated using the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol then acts as the wrapper for a specific covert channel that the tunneled network protocol uses to communicate. The HTTPort tool is used to create a transparent tunnel via proxy server or firewall. This enables the user to operate Internet software from behind the proxy. It will bypass HTTPS and HTTP proxies, transparent accelerators, and even firewalls. â An employee in your company is suspected of downloading ftp of sensitive and proprietary data onto a competitorâs remote ftp server. FTP and ports are not allowed by the companyâs firewall. Which technique might the employee be using? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: IP-spoofing is when an attacker masks his source address by forging the header to contain a different address. Then he can make it seem like a packet was sent via another machine. A response will be sent back to a forged/spoofed source address by the target machine. Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that work like a big chain proxy. The identity of the originating computer is hidden and a random set of intermediary nodes is used to reach a target system. â You configured a rule on a gateway device that blocks external packets with source addresses from inside the network. Which type of attack are you attempting to protect your network against? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: Packet filtering is a defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, or blocking packets from outside the network that use an internal source address. So attackers cannot spoof the address of an internal machine and trick the network into trusting the connection. ARP spoofing is also called ARP cache poisoning or ARP poison routing. It is a technique used to attack a local area network, or LAN. ARP spoofing can enable an attacker to intercept data frames on a LAN, modify its traffic, or even stop the traffic. However, the attack can only be used on local networks. Egress filtering works on outgoing packets, by blocking the packets from inside the network with a source address that is not internal. This prevents an attacker within a network from filtering by launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. â Background: Brutus is a password-cracking tool used to crack the below authentications: FTP(File Transfer Protocol) HTTP(Basic Authentication) HTTP(HTML Form/CGI) POP3 (Post Office Protocol v3) SMB(Server Message Block) Telnet Which of the below attacks can Brutus perform to crack a password? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose three. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2 and 4. Breakdown: In a brute force attack, the attacker will work through software that attempts a large number of different key combinations to guess passwords. To prevent such attacks, users should create passwords that are complex and therefore more difficult to guess. Server Message Block (SMB) signing is a security feature of Windows operating systems. SMB signing ensures that the transmission and reception of files across a network are not altered in any way. Note: Enabling SMB signing on the network reduces the performance of the network because of the increased processing and network traffic required to digitally sign each SMB packet. â What uses a 160-bit hash to prevent against brute force attacks?

The netstat -an command is used to get information of all network connections and listening ports in numerical form. netstat -e will display Ethernet information. netstat -r will display routing table information. netstat -s will display per-protocol statistics. The default setting is for statistics to be displayed for TCP, UDP, and IP. â Which of the below options could represent countermeasures against NetBIOS NULL session enumeration on Windows 2000? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2, and 3. Breakdown: NetBIOS NULL session vulnerabilities are difficult to protect against, particularly if NetBIOS is an integral part of the infrastructure. Take the below steps to reduce NetBIOS NULL session vulnerabilities: You can disable access to the TCP139 or TCP 445 ports, blocking NULL sessions, which require this access. You could also ostensibly disable SMBservices completely on individual hosts by unbinding the WINS Client TCP/IP from the serverâs interface. You can also block/restrict anonymous users by modifying the registry values in the below manner: Open regedit32, and go to HKLMSYSTEMCurrentControlSetLSA., Choose edit > add value. Value name: RestrictAnonymous Data Type: REG_WORD Value: 2 TCP port 53 is the default port for a DNS zone transfer. Disabling it will restrict DNS zone transfer enumeration, but will not be an effective countermeasure against NetBIOS NULL session enumeration. â You have just installed a Windows 2003 server. What action should you take regarding the default shares? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Unless they are absolutely necessary to system function, default shares should be disabled, as they pose a significant security risk. These kinds of shares give intruders the means to hack into your server. â Masquerading (attempting to impersonate a person or another machine), providing false information, or denying the existence of a transaction or event is classified as which of the below forms of attack? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: Through a faked digital signature, email spoofing, and/or taking on the IP address of another machine, an attacker performs a repudiation attack. The attack may also involve an attempt to give misleading and incorrect information or the denial that a real event or transaction occurred. For a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, an attacker would act through multiple computers in the network that were previously infected. These âdistributedâ computers will act together to send out fake messages on behalf of the hidden attacker to increasing the volume of phony traffic. In a distributed denial-of-service attack, multiple machines can generate more attack traffic than just one machine and they are more difficult to turn off than one attack machine. In addition, each attack machine can be stealthier, making it harder for network administrators to stop the attack. In a replay attack, attackers will capture packets containing passwords or digital signatures as the packets transmit between two distinct hosts. The attackers will then resend that captured packet to the target system in order to try to force an authenticated connection. In a dictionary attack, a âdictionaryâ of common words is used to discover user passwords. It can also use common words in both upper and lower case to discover a password. â As a network administrator, you want to secure your companyâs FTP server so that no non-authorized users can gain access to it. How can you do this? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Anonymous authentication allows access to an FTP site without a user account and password. So you will need to disable anonymous authentication to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the FTP server. You can do this through the IIS (Internet Information Services) Manager. â Your computer uses the Windows 2000 Server OS. You need to improve the security of the server. Which of the below changes are required to accomplish this? Answer is complete. Select two answers from the below choices.

Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 2, 3 and 4 are correct. Breakdown: SNMP version 3 does provide data encryption; however, SNMP version 1 utilizes a clear text protocolâwhich offers limited security via community strings. Therefore, SNMP v1 is actually used more commonly than v3. By default, the names of the community strings are public and private and will be transmitted in clear text format. â Background: Jacob works as a professional Ethical Hacker. His latest project is testing the security of a company. He first wants to execute an SNMP enumeration of the web server to collect information about the hosts, routers, and other devices in the network. Unfortunately, without entering a password for the SNMP service, he cannot perform the SNMP scan. He has a theory that the default names may still be in use.

Run an upgrade on SNMPVersion 1 to the most recent version. Access control list filters that will only allow entry and use of the read-write community from specifically authorized stations and/or subnets. â Because SNMP is not generally audited it can pose a significant threat, particularly if it has not been configured properly. Attackers are likely aware that SNMP can be used for account and device enumeration. SNMP has two passwords to access and adjust the configuration of the SNMP agent from a management station: the read-only community string and the read-write community string. Which of the below tools/utilities would be useful for SNMP enumeration? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: SNMPUtil is a command-line tool that gathers Windows user accounts information via SNMP in Windows system. Using this tool you can gather information such as routing tables, ARP tables, IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, TCP/UDP open ports, user accounts and shares. â This web application from Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has well-known vulnerabilities (this app was deliberately developed as a way to teach ethical hackers how such vulnerabilities could be exploited). Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: OWASP created another web security application that serves as an excellent testing tool for students and professionals, WebScarab. This app will intercept agent HTTP and HTTPS requests from a user agent and edit them before they are sent to the destination server. â Which of the following best dictates if certain behaviors are allowed on a system or server? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. â What risk could be posed by having an open port 25 on a server? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â In an asymmetric encryption scheme, any user may create an encrypted message, but only an administrator with a private key can decrypt messages. Which of the below are examples of asymmetric encryption, a scheme in which any user could encrypt messages through a public key? (Choose 2.) Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1 and 3. â Arnold is working as a Network Security Professional. His project is testing the security of his companyâs website. He determines that the company has blocked all ports except port 80. Which of the below attacks could he use to send insecure software protocols? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: The organization had blocked all ports outside of port 80. Therefore, Arnold can use HTTP tunneling to send insecure software protocols. MAC spoofing is a technique that involves the modification of the assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of one machine, exchanging it instead with MAC address accepted by the target system. Using the URL obfuscation technique, an attacker can bypass filters or other defenses put in place to block specific IP addresses by altering the format of URLs. â What is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is primarily used for? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â Which of the below password-cracking tools will work within the UNIX or Linux environment? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: John the Ripper (JTR) is a password-cracking utility that can be used within UNIX, Linux, and Windows environments. JTR is capable of both dictionary (entering hundredsâor millions of words to attempt decryption) and brute force attacks. Brute force attacks are also known as exhaustive key searches. Both dictionary and brute force attacks are most often mounted when an account lockout policy is not in placeâin other words, a security team should simply lock out an account when too many failed password attempts have been made. â Which of the below hacking assaults allow you to bypass an access control list on servers or routers, helping you to mask your presence? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose two. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 3 and 4 are correct. Breakdown: Either the IP spoofing attack or the MAC spoofing attack will mask an identity within the network. MAC spoofing is a hacking technique where an assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address is changed to another systemâs MAC addressâin the attempt to be accepted on the system, which may allow the bypassing of access control lists (ACLs) on servers or routers (either masking the presence of a computer on a network, or allowing the system to successfully impersonate an authorized machine). DNS cache poisoning occurs when non-authoritative information (not from accepted DNS sources) is dumped or placed onto a DNS server, rendering it âpoisoned,â as the information can no longer be proven safe. User clients are then supplied with this non-authentic data, which may or may not be malicious. â Which of the below assertions are accurate with regard to session hijacking? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2 and 3. Breakdown: Session hijacking occurs when a hacker gains unauthorized access to a TCP session when it has already started. It takes control of the session when it is between two machines, utilizing a valid computer session. That session is also referred to as a âsession key.â This process often involves the theft of a so-called magic cookie used to prove the authenticity of a user to a remote server. â How does an operating system protect login passwords? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: A one-way hash is also known as a fingerprint or compression function. Some possible algorithms include MD4, MD5, SHA and SHA256. The one-way hash involves a mathematical function of a variable-length string. It can also be used to create digital signatures and/or file identification. â In which of the below attacks will an attacker use packet sniffing to access and analyze network traffic between two parties, thereby stealing the session cookie? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: In Session sidejacking, an attacker will perform packet sniffing to access and analyze network traffic between two parties in an attempt to rip off the session cookie. Many websites use SSL encryption for their login pages to prevent attackers from viewing the password, but for the remainder of the session do not use any encryption. This allows attackers a chance to intercept data submitted to the server post-login, as well as any webpages viewed by the client after they have logged in. Unfortunately, this data includes the session cookie, making it easy for the attacker to impersonate the victimâeven when the victimâs password has never been revealed. In Session fixation, the attacker exploits a systemâs vulnerability to fixate or set a target userâs session identifier (SID). This method of attack requires a user to adopt the SID, ordinarily through a link sent in an e-mail containing the SID chosen by the attacker. From that point, the hacker can access the site through the SID, posing as the victim. In cross-site scripting, the attacker fools the userâs computer into executing malicious code, which is treated as trustworthy since it appears to belong to the server. The attacker can use this opportunity to grab a copy of the cookie or implement other operations. â Which of the below statements is not true about firewalking? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: Firewalking is a way to determine how a packet will move from an distrusted external host to a protected internal host through a firewall. This will allow the attacker to discover which ports are open and whether these packets can pass through the packet-filtering devices of the firewall. â Alice wants to prove her identity to Robert. Robert asks Alice to provide him with her password, which Alice dutifully provides (possibly after some transformation with a hash function). During this time, woman named Eve observes the conversation between Robert and Alice and records the password. Later, Eve connects to Robert posing as Alice, providing the password read from the previous session. Bob accepts it, unaware that Eve is not Alice. What kind of attack does this describe? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Which of the below commands can be used to scan ports? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The nc -z command will switch the netcat command into port scanning mode. Netcat is a free networking tool that will read and write data via network connections using the TCP/IP protocol. â Kyrie is a Security Administrator. To access his laptop, he only needs to enter a 4-digit personal identification number (PIN). He also set a token to perform offline checking whether he has input the right PIN. Which of the below attacks is a foreseeable result of Kyrieâs folly? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. A brute force attack is conceivable and possibly even likely to occur on Kyrieâs laptop. Since his PIN contains merely 4 digits, it is highly vulnerable to a brute force attack. However, because the token checks the PIN offline, a man-in-the-middle attack is not feasible. Man-in-the-middle attacks involve an attacker successfully inserting an intermediary program between two interacting hosts. The intermediary software or program will make it possible for attackers to observe and even alter communication packets as they pass between the hosts. Once the communication packets sent from one host have been intercepted, the altered packet can be sent to the receiving host, so it seems legitimate. â Jacob is his companyâs security engineer and several employees are requesting that they have remote access to their work machines. What will he use to limit the risks of an MiTM attack? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. â Background: Yuri works as a full-time contracted Ethical Hacker. He recently was hired to complete a security check for a website. In his security check, he is able to teal the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file from the server he was testing. Here is the output: Dick:501:D4DCC2975DC76FB2AAD3B435B51404EE Bruce:500:5351CF62FC930923AAD3B435B51404EE Administrator:1002:8AD7EAA34F1A9A31DA5A59A9D0150C17 Alfred:1001:F1402A82F3AB3A2EBA12F405D7E7327B Given the above list, whose account will Yuri attack and break into in order to obtain administrator privileges? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: RID 500 is used for the Administrator account. In the given scenario, the RID code of Mr. Wayne is 500. Therefore, Yuri will break Mr. Wayneâs account to obtain administrative privileges. â In attempting to crack the password of Server Message Block (SMB), which of the following tools would prove useful? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 1 and 3 are correct. Breakdown: L0phtCrack is a Windows password recovery tool that will assist hackers with dictionary, brute force, and hybrid password-cracking attacks. In addition, L0phtCrack is capable of capturing SMB packets on a local network segment as well as capturing the login sessions of separate users. SMBRelay is an SMB server used to grab usernames and password hashes from inbound SMB traffic. Pwddump2 will extract password hashes from a Security Accounts Manager fileâon Windows systems. KrbCrack is a Kerberos (a computer authentication protocol which works through tickets) password cracker and sniffer. â Which of the below tools would be useful for achieving connection to a remote computer and then executing a Trojan on it? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The PSExec tool lightweight telnet-replacement utility that will execute a process or processes on remote machines; it allows complete interactivity for console applications. With PsExec, there is no need to manually install software on a remote machine in order to execute remote processes. â In performing a security audit, you discover that the password policy only requires 5 characters with letters and numbers (no special characters). Why might this method be problematic? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: A good password policy would involve a minimum of 6 characters, and require letters and numbers. However, a good policy would also sets how often passwords must be changed, and determine for how long a history should be kept. This is a very weak password policy. Which of the below are the well-known weaknesses/downsides of LAN Manager hash? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. LM hash will convert any lowercase passwords to uppercase, Hashes in LM hash are transmitted in clear text via the network, Passwords longer than 7 characters are split up into 2 sections, with a max of 14 characters, It does not use cryptographic salt, It uses only 16-bit encryption â Because system administrators, in managing use of their network, universally use passwords for access control, password-hacking techniques continue to crop up and advance. Password stealing allows hackers to utilize user credentials and could potentially be the cause of significant data losses from the system. Which of these is NOT a type of password attack? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: Password hashing is a method of password encryption prior to its storage so that system password databases cannot easily be decrypted. Password hashing is effective in limiting damage, so long as the proper method of hashing is utilized. Other terms that are used in place of password hashing include message digests and data fingerprinting. The Human Side Social engineering â when an unknown person manipulates a victim into divulging information or taking the action that the attacker wants. This often involves contrived circumstances, such as fooling a user into believing they are someone familiar. It could also involve âtailgatingâ behind a person they recognize on the network. Social engineering exploits the âhuman factor,â where people respond differently to the human element. This may also involve information gathering, whether through âdumpster diving,â or some other method. This is one of the methods hackers use to infiltrate a corporate network, and a large gap in the security of most companies. Phishing, a social engineering method, is used to swindle users into providing information about themselves and their machines. Phishing relies heavily on the low usability of current security methods to protect against these kinds of attacks. Email spoofing is particularly common in phishing attacks, where an email will request details and information from a user, hooking them by providing a spoofed address of a recognizable and trustworthy website. Often the website is practically a copy of the legitimate website, fooling users into trusting it. In addition to the above, shoulder surfing is another social engineering trick. It uses the direct observation technique. The obvious example is peering over someoneâs shoulder when they input a password or PIN. â Which of the below methods of information discovery is used by governmental authorities and the police? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â Which of the below account authentications are supported by SSH-1 protocol but not SSH-2 protocol? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2 and 4. Breakdown: The SSH-2 protocol supports Publickey, (including DSA, RSA, and OpenPGP), Hostbased, and Password-based authentication types. Note: SSH-1 supports a wider range of account authentication types, including the above and RSA only, RhostsRSA, Rhosts (RSH-style), TIS, and Kerberos authentication types. â What are the disadvantages of the successor to the NTLM (NT LAN Manager) Web authentication scheme? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 1 and 2 are correct. The following are the downsides of the NTLM Web Authentication Scheme: Breakdown: NTLM Web authentication is not entirely safe because NTLM hashes (or challenge/response pairs) can be cracked with the help of brute force password guessing. The âcrackingâ program would repeatedly try all possible passwords, hashing each and comparing the result to the hash that the malicious user has obtained. Another major downside is that this authentication technique only functions on one browser: Microsoft Internet Explorer, forcing all users to login through IE. â Which of the below statements is accurate regarding Digest Access Authentication scheme? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: The Digest Authentication scheme replaces the Basic Authentication scheme. Based on the challenge response model, digest authentication never sends a password in clear text format. Instead, passwords are transmitted as an MD5 digest. â Which of the below Web authentication techniques uses a single sign-on scheme? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Microsoft Passport authentication uses single sign-on authentication. Users only remember one username and password to be authenticated for the use of multiple services. Microsoft Passport was formerly known as Microsoft Wallet or .NET Password, Microsoft Password, Windows Live ID, and more recently, âMicrosoft account.â The service has a history of security vulnerabilities and a trail of patches and fixes that were reported by ethical hackers around the globe. â What is L0phtcrack (LC4) used for?

Breakdown: A password policy encourages users to use strong passwords and update them properly in order to enhance a web serverâs security. â Fred is a professional Ethical Hacker. One of his responsibilities includes security testing the web server of his company. His machine is using Windows Server 2003. If Fred suspects that a friend of his installed the keyghost keylogger onto his machine, which of the following solutions should he execute? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2 and 3. Breakdown: Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from âphoning homeâ with his or her typed information. On-Screen Keyboards and other accessibility tools will defeat some keyloggers, but is not an effective solution with all keyloggers, because many of these still send keyboard signals. In addition, screenshots can accomplish the same purpose. It is still recommended, but not by itself. PrivacyKeyboard, or another anti keylogger, will be an effective countermeasure, as these applications have been built specifically to protect against keylogging software. If run frequently, they can limit the amount of information delivered to a hidden keylogger before itâs discovered. â Email tracking comes under which of the below hacking phase(s)? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. â In which of the below attacks involves an attacker creating IP packets with a faked source IP address with the intent of masking his identity or impersonating another system? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Cross-site request forgery, which is also known as a one-click attack or session riding, occurs when a hacker sends unauthorized commands from a user that a website already trusts. Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF works through exploitation of the trust that a website has in a userâs web browser. This method often uses social engineeringâfor example, the hacker will send a link via message or emailâand the user will be tricked into opening a link that contains a malicious request. Through this link, the attacker can force the victim to execute a command, such as a funds transfer, information modification or logout. â Which of the below tools are used for anti-phishing? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: The Netcraft website stores the data of phishing websites and offers a toolbar that analyzes website authentication. Periodically, Netcraft will poll web servers to discover the OS version as well as the serverâs software version. Netcraft offers anti-fraud/anti-phishing services, application testing, and PCI (Payment Card Industry) scanning. In addition, Netcraft can be used for analysis in the following areas: market share of web servers, operating systems, hosting providers and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) authorities. â Aaronâs server is Linux-based, and he wants to use a tool to filter packets by MAC address and TCP header flags. One of the below tools will work for this task. Which one? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: IPTables is the replacement for the IPChains firewall used by earlier versions of Linux (before the Linux 2.4 kernel and later versions). â Rueben has been given the task of testing security for his employerâs website. He first installs a rootkit on the Linux server of the network. Once a rootkit has been installed, what capabilities will an attacker have on a system or network? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 3, and 4. Breakdown: A rootkit is a set of tools or utilities that enable an unauthorized user to take over a system free from detection. A packet sniffer or network analyzer intercepts traffic passing over a network or a part of a network, recording the information (called a packet capture). A buffer overflow or overrun is accomplished when an attacker sends input to a web application that forces the application to input more data in a buffer than it is capable of storing, potentially crashing the application, corrupt data, or allow the execution of the attackerâs code. Attackers will often utilize buffer overflows in order to corrupt the execution stack of a web application. They cause the web server to execute code, possibly attempting to take control of the machine. â After placing a Trojan file trojan.exe within a text file readme.txt via NTFS streaming, how can the Trojan be extracted from the readme.txt file? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. â You work as a network security administrator. You suspect that someone has gained access to your machine and used your e-mail account. To uncover potential viruses installed on your computer, you run a full scan. However, you do not find any illegal software. Which of the below security attack types often run in the background on a machine? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: A zero-day attack (or zero-hour attack), exploits a vulnerability that currently does not have a fix or solution. Often, the security team is unaware of the vulnerability until âday zero.â â Peter wishes to use the Stenographic file system method for encryption of data and to hide private information. Which of the below are potential storage locations for him? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose three. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 1, 3 and 4 are correct. Breakdown: In the Stenographic file system, files are stored to encrypt data in an efficient, untraceable way. There are 3 methods/places for hiding this data within disk space: Unused sectors Slack space Hidden partition â Alan is resigning from a company for personal reasons and now wants to send out proprietary and secret information about the company. So he edits an image file, using tool image hide and embedding the damaging file within his image, and then sends it to his private email account. The mail server doesnât recognize the file within his image file, and does not filter it. What is his technique called? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: Alan utilized the Steganography technique to transmit malicious data. Steganography is the art/science of concealing data/information by embedding one harmful message within another seemingly innocuous message. â Which of the below tools can be used to hide secret data within a text file? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: Snow.exe is a steganography tool that can be used to embed and mask secret data within simple text files. Since spaces and tabs are usually not visible in text viewers, where the file will likely open, messages can be effectively sneaked in without cluing in an unguarded observer. Watermarking is an irreversible process wherein information is permanently embedded into digital media. While steganography attempts to conceal the existence of the code, watermarking is primarily about the robustness; does it show up properly after it has been modified. The purpose of digital watermarks is to provide copyright protection for intellectual property that is in digital form. Unlike metadata, watermarking does not modify the size of the carrier signal. This protection method is considered a passive protection, because it doesnât degrade the data or restrict access. â You have installed a keylogger on Margaretâs computer, complete with password protection. In the final step, or the covering tracks step, which of the following actions would you perform before walking away? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2, 3 and 4. Breakdown: Covering Tracks is the final and very important step in remote hacking. All logs should be removed from the target system. When the target system is Linux or UNIX, all entries of the /var folder must be removed. On Windows, it is important to delete all events and logs, an action that keeps the hackerâs identity hidden. In addition, security events or error messages logged during the process should be removed to avoid detection. Hackers will therefore either clear those event logs or disable auditing altogether. â A hacker successfully broke into an application, but then failed to cover his tracks in the enterprise systems. The forensics investigator found it quite simple to follow the hackerâs actions back to the source. What action could a hacker take to prevent being discovered and/or identified? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â In order to determine how a Windows server has been attacked, you decide to check the event logs for traces of the hackerâs activity. You look for patterns in the hackerâs behavior that might later lead to identifying the responsible party. Luckily, one of the below tools has been used on the system that will capture these events. Which is the correct tool? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Through Auditpol a systems administrator can enable or disable system auditing (from the command line). It is also useful in discovering what quality of logging a security team previously implemented. Auditpol is incorporated into the Windows NT Resource Kit. â Ralph needs to demonstrate a type of attack that an ordinary firewall and IDS system would not detect. It should only be able to be discovered through tcpdump, which captures each packet that enters or leaves a server machine. Ralph therefore initiates his TCP connection with a server using port 80. He uses two distinct hosts on two distinct networks; one network acted as server while the other acted as a client. Even with the most current version of Snort, updated to include the latest rule sets, installed and running throughout the demonstration, Snort did not raise an alarm about any attack. Which of the below attack types does Ralphâs demonstration explore? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: A Covert Channel is a channel utilized for unauthorized and policy-breaking communication that allows information to be moved through a network that goes under the wire of any firewalls or intrusion detection systems. Thus the attacker is able to send information in and out without detection. The technique is effective because it sends information through and via ports that the firewall expects will be trustworthy. Zero Day Attacks can be prevented with something called âApplication Whitelisting,â which blocks unauthorized applications from running on a system. The systems administrator keeps a list of acceptable/authorized applications and any other application will not be allowed to initiate/run. Applications are checked against the whitelist when they attempt to loadâan added security step is to include a hashing prevention method. White listing is more secure than black listing, which is a list comprised of all the disallowed applications. Inside-Out Attacks, otherwise known as firewall piercing, rely on the principle that a firewall cannot and should not try to protect a network against internal users. So the attacker tries to attack from the internal network by establishing a connection from a trusted machine inside a network to an outside, untrusted machine. Tor (formerly an acronym for âThe Onion Router) is an anonymizing âvirtual circuitâ system with a bit of a dicey history. Although Tor advertises itself as an anonymity tool for âordinary people who want to follow the law,â in reality it is often used for carrying out attacks without giving away your identityâdefamation, fraud, and identity theft. The tool gives hacktivists and malicious hackers alike the chance to dodge surveillance and/or traffic analysis on a network. Tor has, however, many weaknesses. â How can a covert channel be utilized (select all that apply)? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2, and 3. â After a series of confusing and frustrating attacks, a company decides to hire you to do a security audit of its network. The company is suspicious that the attacks, which seem to have no clear purpose, might be the folly of a malicious insider or a disgruntled employee. Therefore, they direct you to perform security tests that will reveal any inside attacks initiated from within their corporate network. Which of the tests below would prove useful under these circumstances? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose two. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 2 and 3 are correct. Breakdown: Several utilities have been developed to accomplish DNS Tunneling. One example is DNScapy, which was designed to allow security teams to detect holes in their security. These utilities allow hackers to gain access to a website or connect to a hotspot that they otherwise would be prevented from accessing due to HTTP proxies. As described above, an inside-out attack allows an ethical hacker or malicious hacker to bypass firewall rules by initiating the connection from inside a network. â Background: After checking a log from Snort, you notice the following: Your systems administrator needs to report back to the company with details about the network. What kind of attack has most likely occurred according to the information given in the log above? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Port 31337, where the packets initiate from, is often the port used by Back Orifice. An attacker uses Back Orifice (BO) to install an inconspicuously sized program on a machine, using another machine to remotely control that server program through a graphical interface. Then communication can flow through TCP or UDP network protocols between the two components. Netbus is a program used to remotely control (and is often used by hackers to attack) Microsoft Windows systems. Netbus also utilizes two components. Before Back Orifice, Netbus was widely usedânow they are often used in conjunction with each other. Some of the capabilities of Netbus include tunneling protocol, keystroke logging and injection, screen captures, launching applications, searching files, forcing shutdown, and tunneling. SubSeven functions in much the same way as the above-mentioned tools, but has more features than Netbus, including webcam capture and a user-friendly registry editor. However, it cannot log activity. Antivirus programs ordinarily detect it. â Which of the below netstat command parameters would display all active TCP connections as well as the TCP and UDP ports in a listening state? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Displays all active TCP connections as well as the TCP and UDP ports in a listening state. -b: Displays the binary programâs process file name associated with every connection and/or listening port. Time-consuming. -e: Displays statistics, including packets (sent, received) and more. This can be combined with -s. -f: Displays (in Windows Vista or newer versions of Windows only) absolute domain names for non-domestic addresses. â Which of the below netstat command parameters would display an IP routing table? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â Background: A Trojan virus has been placed onto your server. It is sending data from your server to the attackerâs machine. Then you see the hacker has entered the below command: nc -l -u -p 22222 < /etc/passwd What will this command do? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. â William is learning about ICMP tunneling and needs to know which of the below statements does not represent a fact about this covert connection technique. Which of the below does not apply to ICMP tunneling? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. All other statements are true. â A hacker wishes to use a netbus Trojan on the Windows program, chess.exe. He will use his program to break into the target machine. Which of the below tools should he choose to do this? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: A wrapper is a program that is used to combine a harmful executable file with a harmless executable file. â In his Network Security Administrator position, Vernard has the responsibility to observe, secure and analyze the network of his company. At the moment, Vernard is most concerned to learn that it is possible for others to utilize bypass authentication in order to access his companyâs network. This gives them more permissions than they were intended to have, and creates a vulnerability that could compromise his companyâs data, secrets and client list. What is the name used for this activity, which is often called privilege escalation? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: A backdoor would be blamable for this kind of privilege escalation. A backdoor is a software application, program, or account created or modified to access to the target system by bypassing security checks. Security professionals and vendors skim off time by using backdoors to bypass the security checks during the troubleshooting phases of a project. However, backdoors are also a threat that allows attackers to break in undetected and should be taken seriously to prevent their exploitation. â Which of the below could be signs of a virus attack on a machine? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose two. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 2 and 3. â A web server you are working with hits 100,000,000 total visits and immediately crashes. What kind of malicious code may have been used to cause this sudden crash? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: : The correct answer is 4. Breakdown: A type of malware, a logic bomb will execute a malicious action or function once a specific condition has been met, such as a specific date/time has been reached. In this situation, the logic bomb lay dormant until the web server hit 100,000,000 total visits. A logic bomb can be set to delete files, shut down a system, or a multitude of other functions. Worms are standalone applications/programs that copy themselves from system to system, often through networks. They do not require a host file to replicate itself. Even a worm that has no function other than to replicate itself can prove problematic as it causes an uptick in network traffic/consumes bandwidth. There may also be payload/malicious code embedded within the worm. â Background: Troy is the Marketing Manager for a company. Because he often deals with the public, his email account is routinely subject to various scams and other attacks. Upon arriving to work today, Troy notices an email with the subject âUrgent Security Message.â In the body of the e-mail, it says, âUser must remove Boot.ini file due to corrupted data. This file is potentially harmful to userâs operating system. Troy is not easily scammed. After puzzling it over, he does a quick online search about the Boot.ini file, which turns out to be a vital system file. In fact, it is what loads the OS! Which attack type was carried out (but ultimately unsuccessful) against Troy? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: A virus hoax falsely warns an attackerâs victim that a threat is imminent where none is actually present. Troyâs many years of experience have taught him to always research where his expertise runs short. â Which of the below statements is accurate regarding the distinction between computer worms and Trojan horses? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 3. Breakdown: A Trojan horse is a malicious program code that masks itself as an ordinary and safe program. When a Trojan horse program is running, its hidden code will begin to destroy or scramble information, files, and data on the target hard disk. Worms, unlike Trojan horses, are able to replicate themselves using computer networks and security holes. Worms may either cause an increase in bandwidth or come with payload, or malicious code that has been attached to a worm. â Where a user lacks permissions to list directory contents, yet can still achieve access to the directory and the contentsâso long as he uses the correct path and filename through FTP. What is this kind of FTP access called? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: Blind FTP (also called anonymous FTP) allows users to go directly to a specific directory so long as they use the correct path and file name. One limitation is that these users may not peruse other items without first entering their path and filenames. Blind FTP is considered more secure. â Which of the below tasks would a malicious bot or botnet be capable of performing? Select the best answer. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 5. All of the above answers are accurate. Breakdown: An Internet robot, or malicious bot, runs different automated tasks, often simple and repetitiveâbut at a much faster rate than an individual could manually complete. Here are some activities that can be performed by one of these bots: Launching DDoS attacks. Collecting email addresses from within contact forms and/or guestbooks. Downloader bots will drain a targetâs bandwidth by actually downloading the entire website. Stealing confidential and/or financial information, including credit card account numbers, logins, etc. Scraping of websites to steal and plagiarize website content. Purchase of tickets in order to resell. Resource farming on many online games is accomplished via bots. â Eric is always struggling with computer issues. When Eric opens a website, it starts an automatic download containing harmful code onto his machine. What should he do to prevent this from occurring in the future? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose two. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: Answers 2 and 4 are correct. Breakdown: Eric could disable certain ActiveX Controlsâdisallow unauthorized controls and/or active scripts through the web browser. This would enhance, but not completely shield, his computer from browsing sessions. â Veronica is an Ethical Hacker. Her newest assignment is website security testing before the companyâs website is relaunched. In order to determine how viruses might affect the server, she places one on the system. With no alerts raised by the antiviruses, which were installed and running at the time, the virus infects the system. Which of the below could serve as explanations for this situation? Answer is complete. Select more than one answer if applicable. Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answers are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Breakdown: A signature-based anti-virus program will not be able to detect all computer viruses. Signature-based anti-virus applications search for recognizable patterns of data/information within executable code: If the attacker has altered the virus signature, any signature-based antivirus software will be unable to identify and locate the virus. If a new virus arrives on the scene and an antivirus database has not been updated to include it, the new virus will not be discovered by the antivirus A polymorphic virus mutates itself through encryption and modification, preventing an antivirus from discovering the file/virus. Generic signatures can discovery new viruses (or their variants) by detecting recognizable malicious code in files. Sandboxing and analyzing file can help an antivirus capture malicious executable code. Promiscuous mode, which often requires administrative access, is enabled by setting a network card up in such a way that all traffic received by the network will be sent to the CPU (rather than packets specifically coded to be received by the CPU). This is useful for packet sniffing, logging traffic and decoding it for information. â The Internet Protocol Suite includes several dozen distinct protocols all utilized to accomplish different tasks. Which of the below protocols will match an IP address to MAC addresses on a network interface card? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 1. Breakdown: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is one protocol of the TCP/IP protocol suite used for maintenance of networks. ARP is used to resolve an IP address to its matching media access control (MAC) address. â An attacker is searching for a GUI utility (for a Windows machine) that will allow him to accomplish Man-in-the-Middle attacks, ARP âpoisoningâ and sniffing. Which of the below would allow the attacker to launch those attack types? Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 2. Breakdown: ARP Spoofing works by poisoning the Address Resolution Protocolâs cache by sending phony replies from one nodeâclaiming to be another, authorized nodeâtricking the network into sending data to the attacker when it believes it is sending it to an authorized node within the subnet. This requires the authorized node to have sent a more general request that the attacker can intercept and utilize in creating a false reply. Which of the following is a component that provides resources over a network? â Show answer and Breakdown Answer: The correct answer is 4.âBreakdown: A server provides or âservesâ up resources to a network. Examples of resources are access to email, pages on a web server, or files on a file server. Answer: The correct answer is 4âBreakdown: A server provides or âservesâ up resources to a network.
