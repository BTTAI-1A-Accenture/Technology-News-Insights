Top 10 Best Dating Apps In India     The past few years have seen an increase in the popularity of online dating. The fact that apps like Tinder, Hinge, and Happn have millions of users worldwide and that there are now other applications in the same genre, plus the growth of social media, make this point very clear. But, as the numbers rise in regards to users and apps, confusion regarding the best app and bona fide user base is also visible. Hence, keeping all of this in mind, we have developed a list of the 10 best dating apps in India. 1. Tinder
Tinder is a geosocial networking and online dating application. Users of the dating app Tinder “swipe right” to like or “swipe left” to disapprove of the profiles of other users, which contain their images, a brief bio, and a list of their interests. The “double opt-in” approach used by Tinder requires that both users like one another before they may send messages to one another.
At a hackathon launched in 2012 at the West Hollywood incubator Hatch Labs, Tinder was created by Sean Rad. By 2014, Tinder was tracking one billion “swipes” every day and said users checked in an average of 11 times per day.
