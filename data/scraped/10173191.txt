August 19, 2024 LETTER TO THE EDITOR: By Richard Strickland, Las Vegas Tuesday, Jan. 17, 2023 | 2 a.m.  The Republican-controlled House continues to break from reality. For years, we have seen Republicans try to refute reality on a number of issues, including scientific findings like the crisis of global warming. Nothing got resolved. All that happened was that unnecessary delays occurred in dealing with major problems that politicians could have helped with. This break with fact and reality has continued and was seen in the Republican refusal to accept Joe Biden’s election, and the Republican attempt to overturn those election results — which Republicans know they will pay for in courts and at the ballot box. So now, some of these same people believe they can run the government with a very small majority in the U.S. House, somehow in secret. They are going to demand that the FBI somehow throw open their files concerning current investigations — investigations that include some of the very same Republicans who sit in that House. Further, they are under the delusion that they will obliterate Social Security and Medicare under threat of failing to raise the debt limit. These poor fools seriously believe they have leverage that they don’t have, or they are under an equally ludicrous belief that they can keep all of this a secret from the American public. You cannot continue to act counter to fact and reality without that reality reaching up and biting you. They are very close to this painful bite.
