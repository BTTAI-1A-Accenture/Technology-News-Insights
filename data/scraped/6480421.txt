 Septim Dynasty  Many, yes. Many wouldn't. Living in the West has many problems and the income/cost-of-living/lifestyle/working-hours imbalance can be quite severe in places like Canada. The "attracting immigrants" crowd continually fails to mention the "no shared citizenship" elephant in the room. It's a huge red flag for all potential immigrants. They either have to choose to give up on their homeland completely (rare!) or always feel like a legal outsider. On top of that, their own children have to choose! Yeah, I definitely tell my foreign friends "think twice before looking at women in Japan. Think twice before considering anything but a temporary job here. Maybe think three times." 1

 It doesn't take much to find satisfaction in Japan. Housing costs are incredibly low so it's possible to work less and live more. Having lived in a rat race before, I don't think I can ever go back. The only downside is going back to visit is much more expensive from Japan than vice versa. 0
