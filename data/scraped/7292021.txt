The New Hampshire Insurance Department alleged that the firm failed to spot mass emails that included misleading statements. September 8, 2023 The New Hampshire Insurance Department has fined Northwestern Mutual $400,000 for what the regulator claims was lax oversight of emails sent to prospective clients.  Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. agreed to pay an administrative penalty of $200,000 to resolve allegations that, from 2019 to 2021, the firm's agent producers in New Hampshire sent "thousands" of emails to prospects that misrepresented the producers' level of experience and their client base, according to a consent order published by the regulator. Despite the firm's email monitoring system, Northwestern Mutual allegedly failed to stop the emails, the Insurance Department alleged.  The company also agreed to provide updates to the regulator about its work toward improving its email compliance system as well as the ways in which it's training its personnel to avoid future issues, according to the consent order.  Meanwhile, the firm's affiliated broker-dealer, Northwestern Mutual Investment Services, agreed to pay an administrative fine of $175,000 as well as costs of $25,000 to resolve allegations that its agent trainees sent mass emails to prospects without prior review or approval by the company's compliance staff, as was required by the firm's policies and procedures, the Insurance Department said in a separate consent order.  Furthermore, some of the emails went out in states in which agents weren't licensed to conduct business, according to the regulator.  The broker-dealer also agreed to look into setting up a system for spotting similar advertising on a mass scale, as well as to train its email-review personnel, field supervisors and marketing-materials compliance staff on identifying and reviewing mass emails for misleading statements and reminding registered representatives about their obligations related to communications with the public, the Insurance Department said.
