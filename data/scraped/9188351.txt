 üü™¬†Read the full version on¬†Substack here Last week, I wrote about how the 'Swarm' controls the entire world population through a select elite of 10,000, comprising individuals, corporations, senators, government agencies, and financial institutions. Above them all, sit BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, who collectively exert control not only over our energy, food supply, and healthcare but also over virtually every aspect of our lives, accomplishing this by dominating the world of finance. Their power lies not in creating more value but in controlling the source of money. If you follow the money, you will learn that everything you once believed about money is simply untrue. To illustrate this, at the bottom are the 8 billion people who are going about their lives to survive. Above them is the government, a group of people who are granted a monopoly on force and use it to tax and control us, regardless of whether we agree. But who controls them? At the next level are the corporations. Many would argue that it is now corporations, rather than nation-states, that govern the world. They refer to it as a corporatocracy. To obtain the world's resources and dominate the markets, this corporatocracy must have access to inexpensive capital. The large corporations secure loans at preferential rates from major banks, implying that those who oversee the major banks, the financial elite, ultimately govern the corporations. Breaking down the hierarchy: Financial Elite: This global financial elite, represented by influential figures like the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, and Morgans, convene clandestine meetings within exclusive groups such as the Council on Foreign Relations. Their decisions shape worldwide economic policies, consolidating wealth and control on a grand scale. Bank for International Settlements (BIS): Situated in Basel, Switzerland, the BIS functions as the central bank for central banks. Dominated by financial magnates, predominantly from the United States, England, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Japan, it operates discreetly and escapes the oversight of national governments. Despite its low profile, the BIS wields substantial authority in the global financial realm by regulating reserve requirements, affecting the money banks must hold in reserve. International Central Banks: Central bankers strategically leverage institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), exploiting the resources of countries they lend to while often pushing them into financial turmoil. For instance, every dollar contributed by the United States to these institutions results in more than double that amount in contracts for U.S. Corporations such as Halliburton, Exxon Mobil, and Bechtel, all controlled by the economic elite. National Central Banks: Virtually all nations maintain a central bank, where commercial banks hold memberships. Central banks wield the authority to set interest rates and determine the money supply. They also extend loans to governments, securing a higher position in this hierarchy. Big Banks: Prominent financial institutions provide corporations with loans at preferential rates, enabling their business endeavors. This positioning elevates banks above corporations and the general populace, as funding is the lifeblood for corporate projects. Corporatocracy: Corporations wield considerable influence by financing political campaigns and exerting their power through lobbying. In today's landscape, some corporations surpass entire national economies, thereby overshadowing the government. Government: Governments primarily rely on taxpayer funds, granting them a position superior to the people. If the government requires additional capital, it must turn to a Central Bank for borrowing. People, The Planet, and All Living Things: At the foundation of this hierarchy lies the majority of the world's population and all other forms of life. Disturbingly, by 2010, one in seven people on Earth faced food scarcity, and ecosystems were in a state of distress. BlackRock, founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, has grown into the world's largest asset manager, overseeing trillions of dollars in assets. The firm's journey to dominance was punctuated by strategic acquisitions, including the purchase of Barclays Global Investors in 2009. This move solidified BlackRock's position as a leader in both active and passive investment strategies Vanguard, founded by John C. Bogle in 1975, revolutionized the investment industry with its innovative approach to passive investing. Bogle's creation of the first index mutual fund, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, laid the foundation for the company's future success. The philosophy was simple but groundbreaking: provide investors with low-cost, diversified portfolios that mirror market indexes. Vanguard's emphasis on low fees has been a game-changer, allowing individual investors to access the market at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional active fund managers. State Street Corporation, founded in 1792, is one of the oldest financial institutions in the United States. While it may not have the same household name recognition as Vanguard or BlackRock, it plays a critical role in the global financial system. State Street is a leader in custodial banking, serving as a trusted guardian of institutional assets. üü™¬†Read the full version on¬†Substack here Share this story with a friend.¬†If you enjoyed this article, share it with a friend or leave a comment below.
