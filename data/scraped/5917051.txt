With the arrival of the last module by ship from its  fabrication yard in Zhuhai, China, Fluor Corp. has completed the module  fabrication program on the LNG Canada project. Fluor, with its joint venture partner JGC Corp., is  delivering multiple aspects of the project, including engineering, procurement,  fabrication and delivery of modules, and construction of the project's  infrastructure and utilities, marine structures and LNG storage tank.
