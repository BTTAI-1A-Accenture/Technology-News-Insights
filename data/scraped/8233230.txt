Our Bureau, Bengaluru




Arya.ag, India's leading agritech platform, has announced a strategic partnership with The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA), to enhance and streamline crop monitoring for soybean across 51 Districts. The collaboration will leverage the company’s cutting-edge satellite surveillance product, Prakshep, and its Artificial Intelligence ‘VaMa’ powered by multiple data sources. As part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), SOPA will receive dynamic information, rich datasets, maps, and data-enriched secure APIs for their subscribed districts, spanning Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan. The integration of state-of-the-art technology will enable SOPA to remotely scout its districts, detect anomalies, and track farm growth seamlessly through a user-friendly web/mobile application provided by Arya. Chattanathan Devarajan, co-founder at Arya.ag., said, "We are very honoured to become SOPA’s satellite surveillance partner.  Through this partnership, Arya.ag and SOPA would leverage deep tech capabilities for real-time monitoring of the Soybean crop across the country. Our satellite surveillance product, Prakshep, combined with the power of Artificial Intelligence 'VaMa', will empower SOPA to make informed decisions for strengthening the soybean value chain.”  D.N. Pathak, executive director at SOPA, said, “SOPA, as a leading association in the soybean processing industry, recognises the transformative potential of Arya.ag's technology to drive efficiency and sustainability in agriculture. Arya's promising technology will add value to SOPA's crop surveillance report. The collaboration promises to enhance crop productivity, optimise resource utilisation, and foster sustainable practices across the soybean value chain.”
