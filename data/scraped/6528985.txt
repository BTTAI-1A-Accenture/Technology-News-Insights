					Nonprofit, independent journalism. Supported by readers.				 The latest on the politics and policy shaping Minnesota. Delivered straight to your inbox. Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter takeover is among the biggest media stories of 2022. What might top the list in 2023? Artificial intelligence? More turmoil at giant corporate media companies? Social media platforms deprioritizing local news? Let‚Äôs make it: Local news outlets thrive and make their communities stronger. While social media companies chase profits and are mired in chaos, MinnPost is focused on what we can control: producing in-depth, rigorous stories on critical issues in Minnesota. ü§ç SUPPORT MINNPOST As I reflect on my first 5+ months as editor of MinnPost, I‚Äôm heartened by the response from readers across Minnesota who followed our election coverage. In 2023, we‚Äôre excited to cover a crucial legislative session, city elections, continued discussions over public safety and reform and more. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg might make a big splash when it comes to media buzz, but the real news is in your local, independent publications. We want you to be part of this important work, and the best way to do that is to make a contribution to our year-end fundraising campaign.
