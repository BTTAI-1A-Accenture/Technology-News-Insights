  Anshul Khandelwal, CMO and CRO of Ola, said: “Our new campaign film demonstrates the power of technology to bring people together and create something truly unique. By highlighting the imaginative and collaborative spirit of our robots at the Ola Futurefactory, we hope to inspire viewers to think about how they can use technology to express their own creativity and connect with others. At Ola, we believe in harnessing the best of both worlds – technology and humanity – to create a better and more inclusive future for all.“ “From the moment we saw the autonomous bots at the Futurefactory, we knew that we had to do something creative with them. A story, a stunt…something that triggers a connection with them. When the opportunity came, we jumped right in. Bots and Holi, the story wrote itself,” said co-founders, Arvind Krishnan and Prajato Guha Thakurta from Manja. Ola is India’s leading electric two-wheeler manufacturer and colour is an integral part of the product that gives them an edge over other competitors in the market. The occasion of Holi was a perfect stage to celebrate their connection with colour in a visceral manner. Manja was launched last July 2022 by ex Leo Burnett and BBH India leads Arvind Krishnan and Prajato Guha Thakurta. VIEW THE FILM Credits
