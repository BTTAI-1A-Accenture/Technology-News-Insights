Nurses and their supporters rallied Tuesday in front of St. Johnâ€™s Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, demanding the state enforce staffing ratios that mandate how many patients can be assigned to one nurse. Nurses from the Service Employees International Union Local 121RN then took their protest from the hospital to a local office of the California Department of Public Health. Their gripe lies with what they say is the state's lack of enforcement of a law passed prior to the pandemic that allowed the state agency to fine hospitals for violating the ratios and without the proper numbers patient safety is at risk. When COVID patients began flooding into hospitals three years ago, however, the state temporarily waived the requirements. Those waivers have long since lifted, the nurses noted. Hospital officials have said their staffing numbers are safe, they comply with the law and they've struggled to fill front-line positions. The protests correspond with Tuesday's end of the state's COVID emergency order.
