Stemtech Corporation and Union Blue USA Announce Revolutionary Alliance which will partner Labor Union Members and Trade Associations with a direct selling company with broad-based health, wellness products and services, and personal business opportunity executed through mutually beneficial programs. MIRAMAR, FL / ACCESSWIRE / May 17, 2023 / STEMTECH CORPORATION (OTCQB:STEK) Charles S. Arnold, Chairman and CEO of Stemtech, stated "Stemtech has formed a partnership with Union Blue USA, an association established to service labor unions which will provide members the opportunity to improve their health by taking Stemtech's all-natural, plant-based stem cell nutrition 'stemteuticals' and skincare products. In addition, they will be able to take advantage of Stemtech's income-earning opportunity as distributors for a network marketing company. Stemtech will be able to help more people by enrolling Union Blue USA members who will benefit from improving their health and increase their family incomes by sharing Stemtech with friends and family members, earning weekly and monthly commissions. Working with Union Blue USA leadership and members Stemtech will provide great business for both parties." John W. Meyer, President and Chief Operating Officer, comments "the association of Union Blue USA and Stemtech is a first-of-its kind relationship where the vast membership of the Unions will be able to sign up as Stemtech Independent Business Partners (IBPs), sharing the products with family and friends. This relationship is ideal as Union Blue USA has access to millions of union members. Every direct-sales and network marketing company is looking to find more distributors. It is a natural hand-in-glove fit. The combination of Union Blue USA and Stemtech is a great opportunity! This is an achievement never before done in the multi-level marketing industry. As the Pioneer of stem cell nutrition with the products established in 2005, Stemtech will be the exclusive provider of stem cell and other nutritional Health supplements as well as our newly introduced skincare product line, Cellect One Rapid Renew Stem Cell Peptide Night Cream, containing an FDA approved ingredient as part of our proprietary formulation, for Union Blue. We are very excited to begin rolling out the Stemtech - Union Blue USA program in the U.S. All of this business will be run on Stemtech's existing proprietary custom CRM software." Daniel J. Hommel, spokesperson of Union Blue USA, commented "I am proud to have been brought up around the Union, to be a Union Member and this opportunity to develop a ground-breaking, long-term business development strategy in our company Union Blue USA. UB will deliver life benefitting products, services, and wealth creation opportunities to union members, families, and friends across all Unions nationally". Mr. Meyer continues to say that "Stemtech nutritional and skincare products help the body to help itself and now Union Members may improve the quality of their lives by allowing the body's own natural rejuvenation and renewal process to work, without invasive and expensive medical procedures. Union Members work hard and labor in their occupations, many are on their feet all day, lifting, carrying, bending and stretching. Union Blue USA is looking to provide better health for their members, and they felt that Stemtech was the right partner, given that we have provided our Stemceutical products which have seen sold and used by our customers for 18 years with a proven track record. This relationship also allows Union Members to earn an income to supplement their 'day jobs' and add extra income to beat the rising costs we face along with improving their quality of life."
