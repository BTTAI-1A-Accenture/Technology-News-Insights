A man wanted in connection with a reported attempted child abduction at a South Jersey Wawa has been arrested, authorities announced Friday. The incident involved a 7-year-old child on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, State Police previously said. The boy was approached in the bathroom of the convenience store on Route 47 in Dorchester, by a man who offered candy if he left with him. After several days of sharing surveillance photos, a composite photo and surveillance footage, a 79-year-old man was in police custody on Friday, according to Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae. Thomas Cannon, of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, was charged with third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, Webb-McRae continued. State Police also confirmed the case update on Twitter. “Thank you everyone who sent in tips and shared the post,” State Police said in a Friday tweet. Anyone with additional information on the investigation was urged to contact the Port Norris Station at 856-785-0036. Report a correction 👈 | 👉 Contact our newsroom
