 We’re impressed with Blue Cross Blue Shield’s lower-than-average silver plan deductibles and deductibles and better-than-average quality ratings. It offers three types of health plans and four metal tiers on the ACA marketplace. More: Blue Cross Blue Shield Health Insurance Review We generally like Blue Cross Blue Shield for clients who want a PPO, take expensive scripts (assuming the script is covered in the formulary) and for many rural marketplace clients. The company is one of the few marketplace carriers that offers a PPO in most states. That can be important for people who have more medical needs and have to see more doctors or have a doctor who is out of network. BCBS generally covers expensive scripts with lower copays. BCBS generally has great network relationships with doctors and facilities in rural areas. Cons include that their HMO networks in metro areas generally aren’t as wide as some of the other carriers and the prices of their marketplace PPOs can be pretty high. – Ethan Pickner, advisory board member NCQA Quality Rating average  4.2 out of 5

 We like Kaiser Permanente’s superior NCQA quality ratings and excellent average deductibles for silver plans. Also, it offers all four types of metal tiers on the ACA marketplace. More: Kaiser Permanente Health Insurance Review Kaiser Permanente is known for its integrated healthcare system, which offers health insurance coverage and services through its network of hospitals, clinics and physicians. The company’s benefit design often emphasizes preventive care and wellness programs. Kaiser Permanente typically operates on a capitated model, where members pay a fixed monthly premium regardless of the services they use. This can lead to predictable costs for members, but out-of-network care may be limited. – Amber Lynn Benka, licensed agent with California Insurance Co. NCQA Quality Rating average  3.5 out of 5 
 Average silver plan cost for 40-year-old  $551 a month

 We picked UnitedHealthcare because it has one of the lowest average silver plan deductibles compared to other insurers we analyzed, lower-than-average complaints to state insurance departments and better-than-average NCQA quality ratings. More: UnitedHealthcare Health Insurance Review United Healthcare, like other large insurers, has a national presence with large provider networks. There are different networks within the various United offerings, so make sure your provider is in the United network offered by your United health plan. – Patrick Padgett, advisory board member Health insurance pays for healthcare expenses for treatments, medicine and services as determined by the coverage features defined in your specific policy. You pay a health insurance premium for the coverage, whether or not you seek medical care. When you use services covered by your plan, the health insurer pays a portion of your healthcare costs. Depending on the plan type and services used, you may have to pay a share of the bill, as part of the plan’s health insurance deductible (a fixed amount before any coverage begins), copayment (a fixed amount per services) and/or coinsurance (a percentage of the service cost). Some health plans require that you stay within the provider network if you want the plan to pay for services, while others allow you to seek care out-of-network, usually at a higher cost-sharing percentage for your portion. Health insurance covers doctor visits, hospital visits, outpatient care, preventive care and prescription drugs. The Affordable Care Act, sometimes called Obamacare, requires health insurance companies in the ACA marketplace at HealthCare.gov to cover: Congress has added other requirements for health insurers beyond the ACA mandate, including birth control coverage and breastfeeding benefits. Health insurers don’t have to offer dental or vision coverage for adults or medical management programs like weight management, but some insurance companies offer this expanded coverage. Health insurance doesn’t cover everything. Services that are often excluded include: The services that health insurance will not cover (or will only partially cover) depend on the health insurance company and plan type. For instance, a health maintenance organization (HMO) or exclusive provider organization (EPO) plan won’t pay for care outside your provider network, while a preferred provider organization (PPO) plan will cover out-of-network care. The average cost for a silver plan for a 30-year-old is $488 a month. Health insurance costs vary based on multiple factors, including the metal tier and your age. Bronze and silver plans have cheaper premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs than gold plans. We didn’t include platinum plan costs because those plans are fairly rare. The ACA marketplace doesn’t have enough platinum plans for us to calculate an accurate average. UnitedHealthcare was the only health insurance company in our analysis with a complaint level that’s below the industry average.  Health insurance companies offer multiple types of benefit designs, which affect where you can get care, how much you’ll pay and whether you need a referral to see a specialist. The four most common types of health insurance plans are: EXPERT TIPS Mark Fendrick Advisory Board Member Les Masterson Insurance Editor Ashlee Valentine Insurance Editor Amy Danise Insurance Managing Editor Michelle Megna Insurance Lead Editor A low premium may be attractive, but other factors should be considered when choosing a health plan, such as ensuring your trusted clinicians are included in the plan’s network and calculating all of the costs. I’ve found that those who have predictable clinical needs may pay less out of pocket if they enroll in a plan with a higher premium but more generous coverage for needed care. Advisory Board Member I suggest calling your doctor’s office directly to ask if they are in your health plan’s network—don’t assume the insurer’s provider directory online is always up-to-date. Paying the in-network rate will help save you significantly.  Insurance Editor If you’re eligible for a health plan through your job or a spouse or parent’s job, I’ve found that’s often the cheapest way to get the best health insurance. Insurance Editor If you have prescriptions, I would check with the insurance company to confirm that they’re covered and see how much you would have to pay out of pocket. You don’t want to discover later that you have huge out-of-pocket payments for prescriptions that aren’t covered. Insurance Managing Editor A health plan’s benefit design plays an important role in terms of a plan’s flexibility. For instance, an HMO typically costs less than a PPO but an HMO comes with primary care referrals to see specialists and you generally must stay within the plan’s network. I suggest considering those factors when deciding on a plan.  Insurance Lead Editor Here are common ways to get health insurance. Through an employer. Employers often offer group health insurance as part of their employee benefits and it’s usually more affordable than buying health insurance elsewhere since employers typically pay more than half of premiums. Through a spouse. You can likely get added to a spouse’s health plan. That will increase your spouse’s health costs but it’s a way to get coverage without having to look for an ACA plan or other coverage. Through a parent. If you’re under age 26 you are eligible to get health insurance under a parent’s health plan. On the ACA marketplace. The ACA health insurance marketplace at HealthCare.gov allows you to compare plans available in your area. ACA plans are the only health plans with subsidies and premium tax credits (if you qualify) that reduce costs. With short-term health insurance. If you’re looking for low-cost coverage to fill a short coverage gap, short-term health insurance offers limited coverage at low costs in most states. Short-term plans don’t often cover prescriptions, mental health services or maternity care. With catastrophic health insurance. Catastrophic health insurance may be an option if you’re under 30 or going through severe financial problems like homelessness. Catastrophic health plans, sold through the ACA marketplace, have the same level of coverage found in an ACA plan but with low premiums and a very high deductible. 
 Ask The Expert Jason Metz Insurance Lead Editor Penny Gusner Insurance Senior Writer Les Masterson Insurance Editor Amy Danise Insurance Managing Editor Ashlee Valentine Insurance Editor Jacelyn T., Albuquerque, New Mexico Bronze and silver plans have the cheapest monthly premiums. However, they typically have higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs than gold and platinum plans. That means you pay less to have coverage but more when you need care. When choosing a plan, I suggest considering whether lower premiums or lower out-of-pocket costs are more important to you. Insurance Lead Editor – Pearl S., Mineral Wells, Texas You might get a surprise bill that’s larger than expected if you received out-of-network care. Even if you go to an in-network facility, I’ve heard stories of medical professionals assisting in care who wind up being considered out-of-network. Congress passed the No Surprises Act, which sets up a process to help people resolve surprise medical billing. You can appeal a bill and the provider and health plan will work to resolve the issue. Insurance Senior Writer – Frank M., Brentwood, Tennessee I’ve found that doctors who don’t accept a health plan are often willing to work with you. You could talk to your doctor’s office about solutions, such as payment plans or having the doctor charge you a lower rate for services, which they may offer. Another solution is to find another doctor in your area who’s considered in-network on your health plan. Insurance Editor – May M., San Antonio, Texas It depends on how many healthcare services you need in a year. I’ve found that a deductible is likely more important to your costs if you don’t have many healthcare visits, since your costs may never exceed the deductible. If you see multiple specialists and face multiple hospitalizations in a year, coinsurance may play a bigger role. Insurance Managing Editor – Kevin C., Long Beach, California Take advantage of subsidies and tax credits to save on ACA plans. They’re the only health plans eligible for these cost-saving measures, which are based on your household income and size. Whether you qualify for those subsidies or not, you can also compare multiple marketplace plans in your area to find the cheapest costs. One issue I’ve found is that sometimes people only look at health insurance premiums, but it’s wise to understand all costs, including deductibles and coinsurance. Insurance Editor We analyzed 84 data points about coverage and quality for seven large health insurance companies to determine the best health insurance companies. Our ratings are based on: Read more: How Forbes Advisor rates health insurance companies Here are other health insurance companies we analyzed as part of our research. Open enrollment for health insurance begins every year on Nov. 1 through Jan. 15 in most states. If you want your coverage to begin on Jan. 1 you need to enroll in a plan by Dec.15.   A handful of states with their own marketplaces have slightly different open enrollment periods.   Open enrollment periods for employer-sponsored health insurance plans vary by the employer. The employer chooses the period when employees can make changes to benefits. Health insurance is expensive because healthcare itself is costly. Blue Cross Blue Shield says medical care accounts for 90% of health insurance spending.   Other factors cited for high health insurance costs include administrative expenses and costly medical technology. In most states, it is not illegal to have no health insurance.   A handful of states require health insurance: California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, as well as Washington, D.C. All but Vermont have tax penalties for residents who don’t have health insurance. Vermont mandates health insurance but there isn’t a monetary penalty. Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield-affiliated plans offer health insurance to residents in all 50 states.   That doesn’t mean all of these companies offer plans in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. For example, UnitedHealthcare sells health insurance in all states but has ACA marketplace plans in only 23 states. The best health insurance companies in our analysis are Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross Blue Shield, which both received five stars. We looked at complaints made to state insurance departments, quality ratings from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, health plan deductibles, breadth of health plans and metal tier offerings in the ACA health insurance marketplace.
