 I've been discussing many times with some of my closest friends in tech: what's the next big thing? I think what we are currently witnessing with the meteoric rise of #openai 's #chatgpt conversational AI provides a glimpse of what that next big thing is. I've been fooling around with the chatbot during the Holidays, and I find it quite mind-blowing. Of course it has its own flaws and limitations, but the perspectives provided are quite vertiginous. As an example in my current field of work in #digitalhealth , I've tried to ask ChatGPT the following question: "What will be the 10 most impactful digital health solutions in the next 3 years?" Below is the answer provided by ChatGPT's AI model in less that 2 minutes: "It is difficult to predict with certainty what the 10 most impactful digital health solutions will be in the next 3 years, as the field of digital health is rapidly evolving and new solutions are continually being developed. However, some digital health solutions that are likely to have significant impact in the near future include: It is important to note that the impact of these digital health solutions will depend on a variety of factors, including their adoption by healthcare providers and patients, as well as their effectiveness in improving health outcomes." While the answer may sound quite obvious to those working in the field, I am personally still quite amazed by the relevance of the content as well as the subtlety of the wording. What is your opinion? Do you feel some essential elements are missing? Please share your perspective. Also, have you already tried ChatGPT for yourself? If not, below is the link to give it a try. Happy New Year!

I'd like to highlight the people factor in terms of knowledge,  mindset, perception  and behavior: What is really bring value for them -> Technology alone means nothing. Thanks to share your perception and experience Charles Massin  , I like it! üëç:)
