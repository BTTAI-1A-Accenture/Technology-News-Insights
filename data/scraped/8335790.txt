A shocking video recorded on June 25 in eastern China's Anhui province has gone viral on social media, showing a desperate child jumping from the top of an external air conditioning unit on a residential block's fifth floor in order to save himself from the alleged beatings of his mother. The viral footage captures the moment when the child, repeatedly struck by someone from inside the building with a stick, decides to take action by jumping from the fifth floor. The video has since garnered over 10 million views on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media app, according to a report by the South China Morning Post.Â  Local police have confirmed that the boy, while in a non-life-threatening condition, suffered multiple bone fractures. However, a brief report on the police's official Weibo account sparked public outrage as it stated that the mother was hitting the child to "persuade" him to go back inside out of concern for his safety. A staff member from the local branch of the All-China Women's Federation has claimed that the mother was merely "bluffing" with the stick and that the child fell accidentally, as reported by Jiupai News. Responses from the public to the incident have been filled with disbelief and anger. Some have labelled the official explanation as a "cover-up," while others criticize the authorities for failing to prevent child abuse.
