 The cost of casting is related to many factors and knowing what they are will help you consider your casting when preparing your budget. The exact cost of each investment casting project will vary on a case-by-case basis, but there are still a few factors that can affect the final price. Below are factors that may affect the overall cost of the process. The choice of investment casting metal material depends on the application of the casting. Metal material properties, availability and price are factors that affect the cost of investment casting. The cost of the same metal or alloy can vary over time due to availability and even the world economy; interest rates and shipping charges can also affect the price of the material. JC Casting has a wide selection of metal materials, you can choose from a variety of metals and alloys to make your project more cost-effective. The production technology used can have an impact on your final costs. At JC Casting, we offer a variety of casting methods including Investment Casting, Die Casting and Sand Casting to name a few. Different casting methods will best suit specific requirements. For example, our high-quality investment casting process allows parts weighing up to 150 kg to be produced with short lead times. Of course, the more precise the dimensions and the tighter the tolerances, the more expensive the part will be, so keep that in mind. Complex designs also require additional processes and handling, which can further increase the cost of the part. For projects with complex geometries, expect reduced airflow during drying, but prolong the time required to fully dry the part. This in turn can cause the binder in the ceramic slurry to solidify, slowing down production. The number of shells is another factor to consider. The more complex structures required in a project, the more layers are required and the higher the cost. Surface treatment of castings includes heat treatment, assembly, machining and finishing (electroplating, anodizing and mirror polishing). These processes will increase the cost of castings. At JC Casting, we offer a comprehensive list of casting processes, treatments and finishes. We are confident we can meet the needs of your project and industry. Rapid prototyping is an option if your project requires a prototype so that you can test the usefulness and functionality of your design. There are many benefits to choosing this service. For example, it has a short production time, helps you validate or compare multiple casting options before full rollout, lets you change designs without costly modifications to the final part, and is manufactured from your own CAD data. There are various rapid prototyping techniques, but it tends to be more costly to create high quality, high integrity castings with good dimensional accuracy and fast turnaround, so take this into consideration before making a decision. To guarantee high-quality, reliable lost-wax cast components, we use a comprehensive process for inspection and certification. Certification includes chemical and mechanical test reports. We also utilize non-destructive casting quality testing (NDT) to inspect a casting without destroying it. The quality testing methods we perform include: Magnetic particle inspection liquid penetrant testing X-ray inspection With top-notch metal casting quality, testing and inspection standards. JC Casting is a trusted source for quality casting services across a wide range of industries.
