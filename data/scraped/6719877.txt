Share Online travel portal ixigo (Le Travenues Technology Limited) has leveraged OpenAI’s ChatGPT API to build ‘PLAN’, an intelligent trip planner, alongside becoming the first Indian travel company to have ixigo’s plugin for ChatGPT. This platform can efficiently process and comprehend user preferences, presenting them with personalised suggestions, recommendations, and itineraries. By combining the capabilities of ChatGPT with available travel data, ixigo’s PLAN lets travellers receive destination recommendations based on their present location, time, or weather conditions.   Alternatively, if users already have a specific destination in mind, they can choose from a variety of trip themes or provide their own preferences for a customized travel plan. PLAN will automatically label, map, and generate a comprehensive itinerary for the chosen destination and theme, seamlessly incorporating weather and air quality index (AQI) updates. Through PLAN’s conversational user interface, individuals can personalize their itineraries in real-time and collaboratively create their ideal trip plans. “Our app combines ChatGPT’s AI with real-time information to create a user-friendly trip planning experience, including personalised recommendations,” said Rajnish Kumar, co-founder and group CPTO of ixigo.  Founded in 2007 by Aloke Bajpai and Kumar, the Sequoia Capital-backed company has been implementing AI, ML now for a while. Notable investors in the company include IE Ventures, Trifecta Capital, and Micromax, among others. Furthermore, they expanded their services by acquiring AbhiBus, a platform dedicated to booking bus tickets, and Confirmtkt, a platform that enables users to discover and purchase train tickets. Travel Industry Warms Up to Generative AI During Airbnb’s recent earnings call, cofounder Brian Chesky highlighted the potential of generative AI in enhancing customer service and transforming the industry. ChatGPT’s initial application also included generating travel itineraries and providing recommendations for tickets and hotels. Integrating ChatGPT plugins with platforms like Expedia and Kayak allowed real-time data access and instant ticket bookings.  Travel companies are adopting generative AI to manage customer volumes, automate queries, and cater to specific market segments by integrating different languages. MakeMyTrip’s conversational bot employs generative AI LLM and speech-to-text models to serve customers in English and Hindi. The company is currently testing additional use cases and bots for their customers. Read more: Travel Industry has No Choice but to Embrace Generative AI 📣 Want to advertise in AIM?
