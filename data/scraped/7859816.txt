 Twitter Blue is a subscription-based service offered by Twitter that grants users access to exclusive features. These features include the option to undo tweets, customizable app icons, enhanced bookmarks, longer text and video uploads, and early access to select new features such as Edit Tweet. However, it is important to note that Twitter has temporarily ceased the addition of blue checkmarks for Twitter Blue users. Twitter Blue is a verified badge that serves as an indicator of authenticity for public interest accounts on Twitter. It allows people to identify legitimate accounts and trust the information they share.  Twitter's verified badge is a valuable asset for users who want to establish a strong presence on the platform. It provides benefits such as increased visibility of tweets, enhanced credibility, and access to advanced features. Users who display the verified badge have a better chance of achieving their goals on the platform and becoming a trusted source of information. This badge is particularly important for public figures who need to protect their digital presence and carefully monitor their engagement with followers. Overall, the verified badge is a powerful tool for anyone seeking success on Twitter, whether they are a celebrity, a business owner, or an individual looking to grow their following.  The verified badge on Twitter provides benefits, but it has also caused problems. Controversies surrounding bias and favoritism in the verification process, jealousy and harassment towards verified users, and the creation of an unnecessary hierarchy on the platform have sparked debate. According to Chief Twit: Twitter blue check  has created a perception of “Lords” and “Peasants”. To better understand the concept of lords and peasants on Twitter, it may be helpful to delve into the characteristics of its user base and compare them with its closest social media competitor, Facebook.  While Twitter's audience tends to be younger, more diverse, and more politically engaged than Facebook's user base, Facebook users are often more interested in connecting with friends and family, sharing personal experiences, and consuming content. Additionally, Twitter users are more likely to be professionals and career-oriented, using the platform to network, promote their personal brand or business, interested in real-time news, updates, and discussions on various topics, and share industry news and insights. In contrast, Facebook is often seen as a more casual and personal platform for socializing and entertainment. By examining these differences, we can gain a deeper understanding of how social hierarchies and power dynamics play out on different social media platforms. Twitter has faced growth issues compared to Facebook. While Facebook has continued to grow its user base over the years, Twitter's growth has slowed down, particularly in developed markets. This has been attributed to factors such as the platform's difficulty in attracting new users and retaining existing ones, its struggle to combat abuse and harassment, and its failure to keep up with emerging trends and features. In contrast, Facebook has been able to expand its reach by investing in new features, acquisitions, and partnerships. Additionally, Facebook's diverse range of products and services, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, has allowed it to capture different segments of the market and maintain its position as one of the most popular social media platforms. Facebook's quarterly revenue is 25 times that of Twitter.  Twitter's ad spots are considerably more expensive than those on Facebook, with a price difference of 6-7 times. As a result, advertisers may find that promoting their offerings on Facebook is a more cost-effective option. Additionally, Facebook's higher (2X) revenue per visitor compared to Twitter means that advertisers on Facebook can potentially achieve a greater return on investment. With new leadership at the helm, Twitter aims to reduce its reliance on ad revenue as a primary source of income. However, since subscriptions to Twitter only have value for users within the platform, they are particularly valuable to those who are highly engaged with the site. The value of a Twitter subscription is directly proportional to a user's engagement on the platform. The more active and involved a user is on Twitter, the more valuable a subscription becomes. For users who are less engaged or who do not frequently use Twitter, the value of a subscription may be limited. Here's a creative idea: Twitter Pass is an online subscription service that provides access to a variety of online content products such as news, games, and chatbots, all through a single subscription. The name highlights the convenience of having all these offerings available under one umbrella, rather than needing separate subscriptions for each service. This implies that Twitter Pass offers a comprehensive and extensive array of online content, all accessible in one place. Twitter Pass = Twitter Blue  + Substack + Spotify + Apple News+ Twitter Pass has the potential to jumpstart stalling user growth on the platform. With the ability to add more services and features for users to manage through one subscription, Twitter can attract more users who are looking for a convenient and comprehensive online content experience. As more services are added, Twitter Pass can also provide valuable signals to improve tweet recommendations for users. By tailoring content recommendations based on a user's subscription preferences and usage patterns, Twitter can enhance the user experience and drive engagement on the platform. Advantages of Twitter Pass Risks While the service offers several benefits, it's important to note that there are still some risks involved. Firstly, the current users of the service may be the only ones who sign up, which may not result in immediate gains. However, the real value of the service will be unlocked in the long run as users who are at risk of cancelling their subscriptions, such as XBOX users, will be motivated to stay subscribed. Secondly, other services may not be motivated to join the bundle pricing as it restricts their ability to change prices. However, the service offers reduced churn compared to individual subscribers, which can be a significant advantage. Overall, while there are risks involved, the long-term benefits of the service, such as reduced churn and increased value to users, make it a valuable option for both existing and potential subscribers.
