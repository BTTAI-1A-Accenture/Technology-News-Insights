The actor woke up and chose 🔥🔥🔥 The see-through dress trend has shown no signs of letting up, even post-party season. From Anya Taylor-Joy and Janelle Monáe's Critics' Choice Awards looks to Kate Hudson's sheer LBD shared on Instagram, celebs are still very here for naked fashion. Now, Priyanka Chopra has just gone and shared her own spin on the transparent trend and, yep, we're obsessed. For the actor's new British Vogue cover, where she speaks candidly about surrogacy and motherhood, Priyanka also repped a handful of incredible outfits.   Most notably, Priyanka sports a buttery yellow Miu Miu coord set which is toooooooootally see-through. Made from an uber-fine mesh-like fabric, you can see that Priyanka's set is layered over the top of matching Miu Miu lingerie. The outfit was finished with chunky silver accessories, including a wrap-around bangle and ring - both by Bulgari. The combo was shared on Instagram with the caption, "@PriyankaChopra has taken the past year off from acting to focus on her favourite role to date: being a mother. It’s a big change of pace. 'It’s been 20 years of hustling and working at breakneck speed. I’ve always been like, 'What’s the next thing?'' she says in the February issue of @BritishVogue. 'But now I feel I have a centre, a sense of calm, because every decision ends up being about her.'

Ugh, we love everything about this pic - and don't even get me started on her epic hair <33 Priyanka also repped a second daring look, this time leaning into the cut-out dress trend, in an electric blue Alexander McQueen number.
