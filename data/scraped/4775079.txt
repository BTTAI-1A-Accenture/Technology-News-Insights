 Software companies offering backup software help individuals and companies with the many aspects of disaster recovery.  Whether dealing with hard drive failures, natural disasters, or ransomware, a data backup is necessary.  One of the best ways to backup personal computers, workstations, and servers is to use drive image backup software. This article is about disk image backup software solutions and the five best companies that provide them. Data is among the most important elements of a computer system, and the repercussions of not protecting that data can have grave consequences.  It is important for individuals and businesses to maintain up to date backups of their data. The drive image backup software providers offer the following advantages: Disk imaging backup software backs up all data on the hard drive: the operating system, programs, and data files. This means when a hard drive stops working and the data needs to be restored, it is as simple as booting recovery media and restoring the backup to get the system back to the way it was. There is no need to reinstall the operating system or programs. The best companies offering computer backup software provide a means to create boot media used to recover a system from bare metal.  That means you can install a new empty hard drive with no operating system and still recover the system easily by using the boot media. The backups created by the top providers offer data compression, which reduces the size of the backup and can speed up the backup or restoration process because it uses less bandwidth and resources.
