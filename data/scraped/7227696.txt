 Stretching and warming up before exercising is essential for preventing injuries and improving performance. In this article, I will explain why stretching and warming up are important, and how to do them properly according to ISSA (International Sports Sciences Association) and other reputable sources related to personal training and fitness certification.  Why Stretching and Warming Up Are Important According to DoveMed, stretching is vital for flexibility, especially when completed before and after exercise. Flexibility is the ability of a joint or muscle to move through its full range of motion without pain or stiffness. Flexibility can improve posture, reduce muscle soreness, prevent injuries, and enhance athletic performance. When warming up the muscles with stretching exercises, it allows for less stress to be placed on them during the workout. Warming up increases blood flow, oxygen delivery, and temperature in the muscles, which prepares them for more intense activity. Warming up also activates the nervous system, which improves coordination, reaction time, and mental focus.  How to Stretch and Warm Up Properly ISSA (International Sports Sciences Association) is a leading provider of personal training and fitness certification programs. They also offer courses on bodybuilding specialist and specialist in strength and conditioning. ISSA emphasizes the importance of warming up before exercising. They suggest using effective, targeted, and dynamic warm-up routines for every game or training session. Dynamic warm-ups are exercises that involve moving the joints and muscles through their full range of motion in a controlled manner. Dynamic warm-ups can improve mobility, stability, balance, power, and speed. Some examples of dynamic warm-up exercises are arm circles, leg swings, lunges, squats, skipping, jogging, and jumping jacks. In addition to ISSA, Friendship Personal Training also highlights the importance of warming up and stretching exercises before doing any kind of workout. They recommend starting with 5 minutes of light cardiorespiratory exercise such as walking, cycling, or rowing. This will increase the heart rate and blood flow to the muscles. Then they suggest doing 10 minutes of dynamic stretching exercises such as those mentioned above. This will loosen up the muscles and joints and prepare them for the specific workout. To further support the importance of stretching and warming up before exercising, here are four external sources related to personal training and fitness certification: Conclusion Stretching and warming up before exercising is essential for preventing injuries and improving performance.
