If you own a lot of jewelry, you already know how important it is to organize it properly. Your necklaces can get cluttered and you can lose small items like rings and earrings if you do not store them properly. Our team has formulated this guide to help you learn how to organize your jewelry in an armoire so that it stays tangle-free and you can find every piece easily. Read on to find out how to choose the top jewelry armoires in 2024. If you have not heard of this term before, a jewelry armoire is simply any piece of furniture that is designed to store and organize your jewelry. They usually have a number of drawers and cabinets with separate compartments to allow you to organize all kinds of jewelry. Some even have separate hooks to hang your necklaces and chains so they do not become tangled. They are available in a wide variety of sizes and styles, so you can choose one according to the amount of jewelry you have and the available space in your home. With the wide variety available in the market, you can choose one that suits your specific needs. For example, you can get one that has a mirror if you have the space and do not have a dresser nearby. Jewelry armoires come in many different types, and you can pick one depending on your preferences and needs. We have mentioned a few main types of armoires that are readily available in the market. Probably the safest option is to invest in a standing armoire because it can be placed on the floor or on top of a desk. They do not require any extra mounting and come in both small and large sizes. They are easy to move around and are usually ideal to place in an empty corner of your bedroom near the dresser. This is because they usually do not come with a mirror. Cheval armoires are ideal for those who have less space but tons of jewelry to organize. Such armoires combine both full-length mirrors and drawers and hooks for your jewelry. The full-length mirror is in the form of a door, and opening it reveals an organizing unit for your jewelry. Cheval armoires are usually tall, but they take up very little floor space, so they can be placed in corners as well. Wall-mounted jewelry armoires save up even more space because they do not take up any floor space at all. You can simply mount them on a wall as you would mount a mirror. The mirror works like a door, just like in a cheval armoire. Also, since every item will be at eye level, you can comfortably pick your jewelry without having to stoop over. If you hate mounting items on your walls or you live in a rented apartment and the owner does not allow you to drill holes, over-the-door armoires are for you. They can be easily mounted on a door, and you can enjoy all the benefits of a wall-mounted jewelry armoire. If you own a lot of expensive jewelry, it is natural to get worried about its safety, especially if you are out of the house for most of the day. A jewelry armoire cannot replace a safe, but you can purchase one with a lock so that your intricate items can stay safe. If you have children at home, it is absolutely essential to own an armoire that can be locked. Kids love to play around with mirrors, and if they find jewelry inside, you risk losing or damaging expensive pieces. Therefore, the security of your jewelry armoire should be your top priority. It is not worth buying a beautiful antique piece that cannot be locked, because what will you do with the armoire if there is no jewelry left to organize. Jewelry armoires come in a range of different price ranges. As the features and quality get better, the price increases. So, it is important to keep your budget in mind when you are browsing for one. Since there are so many brands manufacturing jewelry armoires, you will find one in your range, so do not worry. The overall prices of most jewelry armoires range between $100 and $400. Those that are crafted with expensive, good quality wood, come with a mirror, are bigger in size, and have a secure lock are priced higher than those which do not have these features. The brand of the armoire also impacts the price. If the brand is providing good customer service and after-sales support including return and refund policies, they will charge higher. To make sure you get a good bargain, do not forget to check the clearance section of different brands. You may be able to save a ton of money if the item you buy has a clearance sale. Other than organizing jewelry, an armoire can serve several purposes. One of these is as an organizing cabinet for small items like washers, screws, and beads. It can be used to store and organize small things that can easily get lost, so you can practically store anything in it. Purchasing a jewelry armoire is just the first step in organizing your jewelry. You will need to store every piece properly and designate specific spaces for each. And the most important part, place every item back from where you took it after a night out, no matter how tired you are. If you fail to do this, the entire purpose of the armoire will be destroyed. The interior of jewelry armoires should be made from all-natural fabrics like silk, cotton, and wool. The exterior of most armoires is made from wood, which is ideal because it will last a long time and keeps your jewelry safe. Follow Us: About Us Legal News Connect
