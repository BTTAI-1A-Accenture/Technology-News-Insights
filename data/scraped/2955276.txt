The Celtics traded longtime point guard Marcus Smart to the Grizzlies on Wednesday night in a three-team trade that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston and Tyus Jones to the Wizards. Draft capital was also exchanged between the three sides, but the most impactful part of the deal was Boston’s ability to land Porzingis, which meant parting with Smart, who has been the heart and soul of the franchise for the past nine years. Smart spent his entire career with Boston to this point, and the team reached the postseason each of his nine years. He was the team’s heartbeat - a catalyst on both ends of the floor - whose NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in the 2021-’22 season defined his tenure. Celtics superstar Jayson Tatum has been with Smart since Tatum entered the league out of Duke in 2017. Tatum posted a heartfelt message on his Instagram page on Thursday as the trade was finalized. “My dawg. Forever grateful for you and how you pushed me and helped me along this journey. Never change keep being you, one of a kind can never be replaced! My brotha for life. We gone link back up one day and get us one no doubt about that! Until then, Much love Brodie!” Tatum wrote. Boston will certainly look different in the frontcourt next season with the added offense provided by Porzingis. As for Memphis, the Grizzlies receive a playoff-tested veteran in Smart who can provide All-NBA caliber defense paired with reigning Defensive Player of the Year Jaren Jackson Jr.  Smart will likely slide into the starting point guard role with Ja Morant suspended for the first 25 games next season, and could either slide alongside him in the starting lineup when he returns, or come off the bench to help run the second unit.
