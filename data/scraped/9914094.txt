Each state’s department of insurance is in charge of logging and monitoring complaints against the insurers that operate in their states. Motorcycle insurance falls under the auto insurance complaints category. Complaints tend to center around claims, including delays, unsatisfactory settlements, claim adjusters’ handling of claims and denials.

Your motorcycle insurance policy will detail what coverage you have in place for you and your motorcycle, and specify how you’re compensated when you file a claim. Foremost, American Family, Erie and Progressive are the best motorcycle insurance companies, according to Forbes Advisor’s analysis. These companies scored the highest based on our evaluation of coverage, discounts, complaints, their collision claims processes and availability of online quotes. Liability is the foundation of a motorcycle insurance policy. Liability insurance pays for damage and injuries you cause to others in an accident. You can include coverage that will pay for medical expenses if you or your passenger are injured, such as uninsured motorist coverage, personal injury protection, medical payments and guest passenger liability.   Collision insurance pays to repair or replace your motorcycle if it’s damaged in an accident. Comprehensive insurance pays if your bike is stolen or damaged by non-crash events, such as fire, hail, floods, vandalism and animal strikes. Beyond these, there are many other coverage options you may want to add (or are automatically included), such as custom equipment coverage, safety gear coverage, total loss replacement for new vehicles and roadside assistance. The average cost of motorcycle insurance is $209 a month, based on our analysis of rates in the top states for motorcycle riders. Your costs will vary depending on personal factors, such as the coverages you choose, the type of bike you ride, where you live and your driving record.   Shopping around for multiple motorcycle insurance quotes is the best way to find out how much motorcycle insurance costs for your specific situation.
