  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition Friday morning, at 4:45 a.m., Corning Police Officers were on the scene of a business in town with an open door. While most of the community was asleep at that hour, these officers were doing their job.
For those who do not feel the police deserve better pay, I suggest you go on a ride-along, to see how ‘easy’ this job is. Bring some snacks, as officers sometimes do not get a chance to take a meal break. I suggest you take your rose-colored glasses off, wear gloves, bring hand wipes and a jar of Vicks Vapo Rub so as not to touch and smell the rancid filth these officers encounter. And bring a sense of humor, as this job gets REAL! Vickie Linnet, Corning Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group
