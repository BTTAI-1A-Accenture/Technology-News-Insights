The multidisciplinary study of the transmission of light through the ocean, including the development and use of novel imaging technologies. Studying color and biological light in nature through their various forms and functions. Research interests are broadly concerned with the use of new technology for observing oceanic phenomena and the development of inverse techniques for their interpretation. Focused on the development of an understanding of interaction of light with seawater constituents, variability in ocean optical properties, and propagation of light within the ocean and across the air-water boundary. Focused on understanding the interactions between light and living organisms.
