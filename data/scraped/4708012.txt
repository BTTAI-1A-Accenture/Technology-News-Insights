Addition of Process Mining and Execution Management Software to GSA Schedule Empowers Federal, State and Local Government Agencies to Drive Successful Transformation Amid the Complexity of Siloed Systems
 NEW YORK & RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Celonis, the pioneer and global leader in Process Mining and Execution Management and Carahsoft Technology Corp., the Trusted Government IT Solutions Provider®, today announced that Carahsoft will make the Celonis Execution Management System (EMS) widely available to U.S. Federal, State and Local Governments.
  
Private and public sector organizations’ processes run on several IT systems including enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM) which operate in silos. Over time, hidden inefficiencies inevitably build up, draining resources and stifling performance. The Celonis EMS is purpose-built to reveal and fix these process inefficiencies by liberating resources and radically improving overall performance. The Celonis EMS integrates data across existing systems and provides a real-time X-Ray of an organization's business processes. It visually reveals inefficiencies and accurately calculates their impact on performance. It then fixes the problem automatically, or guides teams to do so.
 
The General Services Administration Schedule with Carahsoft extends Celonis’ availability to Federal, State and Local Governments. The Celonis EMS is now operational in key departments and processes across Government agencies. From finance, procurement, and administration transformation; to mission-focused employee and citizen service transformations.
 
Key agency and citizen benefits include:
 
“Celonis’ inclusion on Carahsoft’s GSA Schedule represents a major milestone for our Public Sector business. It allows us to serve Government agencies at speed and drive our mission to enable Government modernization, one business process and source system at a time,” said Chris Lisk, vice president of public sector sales at Celonis.
 
“As Government agencies continue to digitize their services, it is essential that efficiency is not at risk,” said Craig P. Abod, Carahsoft president. “With the addition of Celonis to our GSA Schedule, our Government customers and reseller partners can leverage the power of the Celonis EMS to get the visibility needed to boost efficiency, optimize performance and lower costs to deliver the highest return for citizen services.”
 
The Celonis Execution Management System is available through Carahsoft’s GSA Schedule No. 47QSWA18D008F, SEWP V contracts NNG15SC03B and NNG15SC27B, ITES-SW2 Contract W52P1J-20-D-0042, NASPO ValuePoint Master Agreement #AR2472, NCPA Contract NCPA01-86 and OMNIA Partners Contract #R191902.
