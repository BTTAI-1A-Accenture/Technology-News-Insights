 Dear Readers, Welcome to the second edition of our newsletter, where we continue to explore the exciting world of modular building with Polycare Modular Blocks. In this edition, we want to emphasize the remarkable qualities of our blocks and how they can revolutionize the way you build.  1. What are Polyblocks made of? At Polycare, we take pride in using 100% recyclable materials for our blocks. By utilising secondary flowable materials such as foundry sand, fly ash, and desert sand, we transform waste products from various industries into sustainable building materials. Our manufacturing process also stands out as we use resin made from 100% recyclable materials, eliminating the need for water. With our blocks, you can build while minimising environmental impact and reducing the carbon footprint of the construction industry. 2. How do you build with Polycare modular blocks? Building with Polycare modular blocks is incredibly easy and efficient. Unlike traditional construction methods, our blocks do not require water or mortar as binders. They are designed to be stacked together, just like building with Legos, making construction accessible to everyone. Despite their stackable nature, our blocks have proven to be more durable than conventional concrete, ensuring long-lasting structures. Moreover, our blocks are reusable, offering flexibility for future projects. With the help of our Polybuilder software, structures can be disassembled and repurposed, minimising waste and allowing for cost-effective construction. 3. How do you start building with Polycare modular blocks? Our blocks are available to all, and since our establishment in Namibia in 2019, we have successfully contributed to numerous projects in Namibia, Zambia, South Africa, and beyond. Regardless of your location, you can take advantage of the benefits of Polycare Modular Building Blocks for your next construction endeavor. To begin your modular building journey with our blocks, simply reach out to us: Email: info@polycare.co.na Cell: +264814506830 Remember, the future of the construction industry lies in modularity, circularity, and sustainability. Join us in embracing this transformative approach to construction. Thank you for being a part of our newsletter. We encourage you to share these remarkable innovations with others who are passionate about building a sustainable future.  Warm regards, Julia Immanuel Marketing
