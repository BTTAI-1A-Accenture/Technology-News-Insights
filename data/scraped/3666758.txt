But Michigan State University is now offering one that reduces the time people normally spend in one by up to 75%. “It allows us to be much more flexible in accepting patients as they come to the door, and treating people as they need it, rather than when we can book it,” Mark Delano, the chair of the Department of Radiology at MSU, said. During test scans on Thursday, excitement for the new MRI technology filled the room with onlookers. “We're really excited about it,” Kurt Sandborn, an MRI technologist at MSU, said. “The biggest thing we're excited about is just the speed that these machines can run at, and how fast we can get these scans done." McLaren Greater Lansing Hospital and MSU said their entire imaging center is full of brand new technology with faster CT scans among other things. On average, full-body MRI scans could take around 90 minutes, but the new machine could do it in under 30 minutes — with potential for improvement. “It’s getting better all the time,” Delano said. “There's a new version of it, that's iterating now, we're looking at a knee scan that can be done in less than five minutes." These machines are also wider than usual making it more accessible for different body types and those with claustrophobia. “I’m excited to send friends and family here to get their scans done, and really just for the whole community as a whole,” Sandborn said.
