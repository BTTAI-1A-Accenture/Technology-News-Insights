Built with next-gen natural processing, Google Bard has become a great tool for market prediction. In this article, we have put the ability of Google Bard to analyze market data to the test. What predictions has the popular AI chatbot made about Tron (TRX), Compound (COMP), and Tradecurve (TCRV)? Tron (TRX) is one of the older, more successful, launched in 2017. However, the expansion of the crypto market over the last couple of years has seen the Tron coin take a step backward in popularity. Despite this, Tron continues to thrive as one of the leading decentralized blockchains for digital content makers. When asked about its future prospects, Google Bard gave a predominantly bullish Tron price prediction. At the time of this writing, the Tron coin trades at $0.08163, gaining 5.13% in the last 24 hours.  However, Google Bard believes the TRX coin could hit a high of $0.15 by the end of 2023. The AI tool is more bullish in the long term, predicting a price of $1 for Tron. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale<< The Compound crypto gained popularity in 2018 as one of the first DeFi protocols that allowed users to earn interest. Amidst the resurgence of the DeFi space, the Compound coin has been one of the top performers. In the last week, the Compound price has increased by over 20%, making it one of the better-performing cryptos.

If it holds above this support region, Google Bard is also bullish about the prospects of Compound (COMP).  According to Bard, Compound has a great chance of trading between $100 or even $150 by the end of 2023. The AI tool puts a fair price for the Compound coin at $124. Join the TradeCurve Ecosystem and unlock amazing benefits with $TCRV 🤖 Get an edge with Automated Trading & AI

In the last couple of weeks, the price of TCRV increased from $0.010 to $0.018 per token. As a result, early investors are currently enjoying an ROI of 80%. With the crypto market now very bullish, TCRV has formed a pattern that will increase the token by 40%. This means TCRV is expected to hit a new high of $0.025 in the next week.  With this bullish momentum, what does Google Bard think about the prospects of TCRV hitting $5? According to Google’s AI chatbot, a fair price for TCRV in 2023 is $1.5, representing an almost 100x price jump from current prices. However, Bard believes if the current trend evolves into a bull cycle, then a $5 price is attainable. Backing this prediction, priceprediction.net puts an average price for TCRV at $4.57 by the end of 2023, making Tradecurve one of the best investment options available.  Visit the links below to get more information about Tradecurve and the TCRV token:- Website: https://tradecurve.io/  Buy presale: https://app.tradecurve.io/sign-up  Advertisement Twitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp  Telegram: https://t.me/tradecurve_official  Advertisement
