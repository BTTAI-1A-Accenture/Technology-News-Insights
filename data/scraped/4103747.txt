Learn More › Finding an all-in-one insurance provider isn’t always easy. Many companies specialize in particular types of insurance or have notable omissions in their stable of insurance products. Even companies that do offer a wide variety of insurance options may not make those policies available in all markets across the U.S. With its nationwide footprint and varied insurance products, Allstate strives to deliver that elusive all-in-one insurance experience. The company stands tall as one of the most visible brands in the industry, which may appeal to consumers who want a reliable and well-respected insurance provider. Among its core competencies, Allstate claims that its bundles can help customers save money on their insurance plans while giving policyholders the flexibility to mix and match numerous plans to build out the exact coverage they need. Do Allstate’s services deliver on this lofty promise, or has the company stretched itself thin by trying to be everything to everyone? Our Allstate insurance review delves deep into the company’s offerings to see if its insurance policies are worth the cost of coverage. See more of the best homeowners insurance companies, the best flood insurance companies, and the best home and auto insurance bundles. Specs Pros Cons Our Verdict: Allstate offers a wide variety of insurance products that can be bundled together to streamline services and lower premiums. Without those bundles, Allstate rates can run somewhat high, though. The company maintains a nationwide footprint, providing insurance to every state in the country. It has also invested in a strong digital experience, with online resources, customer portals, and a mobile app all available to assist customers.  Through its messaging and branding, including its “You’re in good hands” slogan, Allstate bills itself as an insurance company that can provide much-needed relief in customers’ worst moments. Customers who visit Allstate’s website will find a heavy focus on the company’s speed of service and varied bundling options that promise the opportunity for policyholders to save money by purchasing multiple plans. Allstate also champions its long track record in the insurance industry, leaning on its 90-plus years of operations to present itself as a trusted and reliable authority in this space. Allstate has been providing insurance to consumers for more than 90 years, steadily building up a strong reputation from one decade to the next. Starting out in 1931 providing auto insurance policies through mail-order catalogs, the company has expanded into other forms of insurance over the years and now offers a wide variety of insurance products and other services for customers to consider. Allstate maintains a nationwide operational footprint, providing insurance such as homeowners, auto, and flood coverage in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The company stands on relatively strong financial ground as well, as it currently holds an A+ rating from AM Best. The credit rating agency’s A+ grade is reserved for insurance companies that have demonstrated a “superior” ability to meet their obligations to customers. As such, policyholders may feel more comfortable buying insurance from a provider that will likely continue doing business for years to come and will be able to disburse claims funds in a timely manner. Throughout the years, Allstate has been a force of change in the insurance industry, ushering in new developments such as customized auto insurance policies, on-site catastrophe response teams, and telematics devices that measure vehicle speed and mileage to monitor policyholders’ driving habits and measure risk factors. The company’s famous motto, “You’re in good hands,” has guided Allstate’s principles since the 1950s, as it continually seeks out new ways to provide relief to customers affected by unexpected perils. Most recently, the company paid out nearly $1 billion to auto insurance policyholders through its Shelter-in-Place Payback program, which rewarded customers for staying off the road at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. As prospective customers review Allstate insurance offerings, they may find these core strengths to be persuasive factors that help them make a purchasing decision. Allstate delivers a relatively strong online experience for its customers, providing numerous digital platforms, tools, and resources for customers to explore. The company’s online quote tool is straightforward, customizable, and easy to use, offering a quick method for prospective customers to receive a quote for different products. Customers can even finalize payment on a new policy directly from the online quote portal without contacting an agent directly. Elsewhere, Allstate provides a fairly dense library of resources to help answer questions regarding adjusting insurance coverage, managing policies, and submitting claims. These online educational materials can help policyholders understand how to get the most out of their insurance while also showing them how to access their account, view billing statements, and make payments, among other details to be aware of as an insurance customer. Allstate’s Help Center also features an automated chat tool that can provide quick answers to common questions such as how to find or request insurance ID cards or change coverage options on an insurance policy. Although it’s not the most sophisticated tool, and there is no option for live virtual agent support, the automated assistant may be able to answer questions or point customers in the right direction without them needing to hunt around the site or navigate a phone tree to get that information. Customers can also manage their policy information at any time using Allstate’s My Account platform. Using this online portal, customers have 24/7 access to their Allstate account, allowing them to set up payments, update their account or policy details, and reach out to their assigned agent, among other features. Allstate’s dedicated mobile app is another useful tool, which allows policyholders to report claims, request roadside assistance, view policy details, and download ID cards. Allstate offers a wide variety of insurance products that cater to different demographics, ranging from homeowners and renters to vehicle owners and small-business owners. Depending on the specific type of coverage they are looking for, prospective customers may find that Allstate has the right insurance plans for their situation. Allstate’s homeowners policies provide fairly standard coverage options—dwelling, liability, personal property, and guest medical protection—but customers can expand their coverage by purchasing various endorsements and add-ons. Dwelling coverage limits are determined by an automated assessment of the property’s value, but policyholders can increase their coverage at a higher premium if needed. Dwelling coverage amounts over $1 million will require customers to purchase extended building structure reimbursement coverage, but the option is available. With that flexibility, policyholders can get as much homeowners insurance as they need to protect their property against structural damage. Some of the most notable extra homeowners insurance endorsements available with Allstate include water backup, electronic data recovery, musical instruments, sports equipment, and business property coverage. Customers can also receive funds to purchase energy-efficient replacements for damaged property through Allstate’s green improvement reimbursement option. Other homeowners insurance options that may be worth exploring include policies for manufactured or mobile homes. Homeowners can purchase this type of plan to insure tiny houses that do not warrant a traditional homeowners insurance policy. Policyholders who are interested in renting out their home through short-term rental and hosting platforms may be interested in the company’s HomeAdvantage home-sharing insurance. This insurance can help pay for damages if a short-term renter destroys or steals the policyholder’s personal property that otherwise may not be covered with a standard homeowners insurance policy. Allstate offers a few different types of property insurance beyond standard homeowners coverage, including flood, condo, renters, and landlord insurance. The company offers flood insurance coverage either through the National Flood Insurance Program or as a private policy. Regardless of which option customers choose, they will receive standard replacement cost coverage that can provide larger payouts on claims since this type of coverage does not account for depreciation when calculating the value of covered property. With multiple policy options to choose from and built-in replacement cost coverage, Allstate stands as one of the best flood insurance companies around. Condo owners can insure their units against theft, fire, smoke, vandalism, and certain forms of sudden or accidental water damage with Allstate’s condo insurance. As with the company’s homeowners insurance policies, there are a wide range of extra endorsements available for Allstate condo insurance, including water backup, electronic data recovery, and business property coverage. Landlords and renters alike can protect their property by purchasing either a landlord or renters insurance policy from Allstate. Renters insurance protects tenants’ personal property, provides liability coverage, and can help cover living expenses if they need to find other living arrangements after a covered peril renders their home uninhabitable. Landlord policies help pay for repairs or replacement of the structure following a covered event. Additionally, it can compensate landlords in the event that they are unable to rent out their property for a period of time following a covered peril. Allstate stands out as one of the best landlord insurance providers as the company offers numerous discount opportunities along with standard other-structures coverage on every policy. Allstate customers can purchase insurance for numerous vehicle types, but most will likely seek out auto insurance. Allstate’s auto policies include standard coverage options such as collision, comprehensive, liability, medical payments, and uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. Adding roadside assistance to their auto policy will also help customers cover the cost of changing a flat tire, jump-starting a dead battery, or eve having the car towed if necessary. Customers can purchase endorsements to insure vintage and classic cars as well as receive coverage when driving in Mexico. Car owners who wish to use their vehicle for ride-sharing services can purchase additional coverage through Allstate’s Ride for Hire product, and the company also has insurance options for teenage drivers. Customers looking to save money on their car insurance can choose to enroll in Allstate’s Drivewise program, which uses telematic devices and software to monitor driving habits and provides discounts to drivers who maintain safe driving habits like driving under the speed limit and coming to gradual stops at red lights. Auto insurance customers can bundle their policy with other types of vehicle insurance, including motorcycle and ATV policies. Allstate also provides stand-alone insurance policies to cover snowmobiles, boats, and RVs, so there are plenty of opportunities for customers to purchase additional coverage for a wide variety of personal vehicles. Allstate offers both term life and permanent life insurance options, which may appeal to different policyholders depending on their priorities. Term life insurance runs for a set length of time and is often more affordable than permanent life insurance. Customers may want to consider Allstate’s term life policies if they want coverage for a certain period of time—while their children are growing up, for instance. Permanent life insurance has no set end date and comes in three different policy types: whole, universal, and variable. Depending on which option customers choose, they may be able to select fixed or variable premiums, and they may also receive investment options, flexible death benefits, and cash accumulation options. Small-business owners may be interested in Allstate’s business insurance, which can protect different types of business property such as storefronts, vehicles, computers, and machinery. Business owner policies also provide liability coverage to help cover legal expenses and business interruption coverage to compensate owners for lost revenue following a covered event. Allstate also offers dedicated policies for specific professions, including accountants, chiropractors, dentists, and real estate agents. Allstate Identity Protection isn’t an insurance product, but this service could be very beneficial to policyholders in the digital age. Customers can enroll themselves or their family members in one of two subscription plans that monitor their online accounts and personal data in case they are breached or compromised. Both tiers offer full identity remediation, identity theft alerts, real-time security updates, financing fraud monitoring, and reimbursement of stolen funds. Customers who choose the Premium package will also receive social media and credit card transaction monitoring services, free credit score and credit report checks, and enhanced financial monitoring services. Customers looking for extended coverage for their smartphone may be interested in Allstate’s Phone Protection Plus service. Allstate will help pay to fix cracked screens, replace dead batteries, or repair waterlogged phones, and coverage will carry over if phone owners switch devices or carriers. This service also provides tech support from certified technicians who can help customers set up their phone, address connection issues, and troubleshoot problems with specific apps and mobile software. Allstate offers several other types of insurance that customers can pair with their homeowners, vehicle, renters, landlord, or business owner policy. A personal umbrella policy could be a nice complement to other standard insurance plans, providing extra liability coverage exceeding what would be available with a homeowners or auto insurance policy. Allstate’s pet insurance offerings can help cover the costs of medical treatments that may be necessary to keep policyholders’ pets healthy. Policyholders who are planning a wedding, graduation party, or other expensive gathering may be interested in Allstate’s event insurance in case the event is canceled or there is an accident at the venue. Travel insurance is also available to customers and can help cover the costs of lost luggage, missed flights, and emergency medical expenses for policyholders who are traveling outside the country. Customers may find that Allstate insurance premiums run on the high side, at least for homeowners insurance. That being said, homeowners insurance costs will vary depending on a person’s location, risk factors, and coverage options, so it’s difficult to say with certainty that Allstate rates will always be lower or higher than those of any other insurance provider. The same holds true for any insurance product offered by Allstate. For instance, renters insurance costs will depend on the amount of coverage a policyholder needs as well as the likelihood that they will experience a covered peril such as an apartment fire or break-in. Policyholders can take advantage of a number of discounts to lower their premium and make coverage more affordable. Homeowners insurance customers may qualify for discounts on their policy if they have a strong track record of making payments on time and in full, have recently bought a new house, or have avoided filing a homeowners insurance claim with Allstate or a previous insurance provider. Other notable homeowners discounts include additional savings up to 10 percent off rates for both new and returning customers, a 5 percent discount for automatic payments, and a 10 percent discount for customers who sign up for an Allstate homeowners insurance policy at least 7 days before their existing policy expires. Auto insurance customers may find even more ways to save thanks to the numerous discounts available, including savings opportunities for policyholders who are insuring a new car, agree to paperless documents, pay in full, and meet Allstate’s safe driver standards. Students who are under the age of 25 and are currently unmarried may also qualify for Allstate’s “smart student” discount. Customers who enroll in the Drivewise program can save money on their insurance premiums when adhering to safe driving standards such as avoiding hard stops. Perhaps the biggest savings opportunity available to customers is through Allstate’s multipolicy discounts. In particular, customers can save up to 25 percent on their insurance if they bundle their home and auto insurance. Policyholders can bundle a variety of insurance policies beyond the typical home and auto bundle, including renters, condo, motorcycle, ATV, and term life insurance. Allstate customers often have three different ways to get a quote on insurance: online, over the phone, or with an agent. Customers can typically receive a quote for any type of insurance by speaking to a representative over the phone or meeting with a local agent. However, online quotes are limited to homeowners, auto, renters, condo, motorcycle, ATV, and term life insurance. In addition, online quotes may not be available in all areas for all insurance products. For instance, Florida residents who want to get a quote on homeowners insurance may need to speak to an agent over the phone or in person, as Allstate’s online quote platform will not work for all Florida ZIP codes. Aside from those potential drawbacks, Allstate’s online quote tool is intuitive and easy to use so customers can receive a detailed quote in no time at all. Customers looking for a homeowners insurance quote will be asked to provide some basic information about themselves and their property, including the build date, square footage, building materials, additional structures, and protective devices. The online quote tool will automatically apply discounts that the customer is eligible to receive, such as new customer, home buyer, and responsible payment discounts. Customers can also choose to sign up for automatic payments at this stage to receive even more savings on their insurance. Customers have the option to adjust their coverage amounts within the available limits if necessary. For instance, although the platform will automatically calculate dwelling coverage based on available real estate records, users can increase their coverage if they believe they need to insure the structure of their home for more money. Once customers are satisfied with their coverage options, they can actually begin the payment process if they are ready to make a purchase. If they have any questions about their quote, there is also an online chat tool built into the online quote platform that allows customers to ask questions about their policy options. They may also reach out to a representative or local agent for assistance in receiving an Allstate insurance quote. Those who do speak to an agent may have even more opportunities to customize their quote and tailor their insurance policy to their coverage and financial needs. Allstate customers have a few different ways they can go about filing a claim, depending on the type of insurance that a customer has purchased. Homeowners, auto, condo, renters, motorcycle, snowmobile, and ATV insurance policyholders can file a claim online through Allstate’s My Account platform or the company’s dedicated mobile app. After submitting a claim, policyholders can check its status online or via text message. Customers may be required to take pictures of the covered damages or, in other cases, Allstate may set up an in-person inspection to confirm damages. Homeowners insurance policyholders can use Allstate’s Good Hands Repair Network to find a local vendor or contractor to handle repairs. They can also select their own contractor outside of Allstate’s network, if they wish. Auto insurance policyholders have the same claim options available, including access to Allstate’s exclusive repair network. However, they may be required to produce a copy of the police report documenting any damage their car has sustained. Customers who have flood insurance coverage will need to fill out an online form to submit a flood loss claim report. After sending their claim form, which includes information such as the source of the water damage, the depth of any standing water in the home, and the duration of the flood, policyholders must wait for an agent to respond with next steps. Life insurance beneficiaries can download and email a form to submit a claim or call Allstate’s dedicated customer service line for this type of claim. Allstate offers a generally positive customer service experience, giving policyholders multiple ways to contact customer support when necessary. Customers can call a corporate representative using the company’s dedicated customer service line if they need assistance. Although agents may not be available outside of the company’s hours of operation, customers can use the automated Allstate customer service line to schedule payments or check the status of a claim. They can also speak to a local agent, including their own assigned agent, during normal business hours. There are also a number of ways to get assistance online through the company’s website. In addition to speaking to agents over the phone or in person, customers can also email any concerns or issues they have. Customers who go to Allstate’s Help Center will find a wealth of resources that can answer questions regarding how to register an account, recover login credentials, file claims, and receive insurance ID cards, among other issues. The Help Center also has an automated chat assistant that can answer basic questions and address common issues like changing payment options, adjusting policy coverage, and addressing account login problems. For more complicated questions or issues, customers will likely need to reach out to a live agent for assistance, though. After checking out Allstate insurance ratings and reviews from across different customer review sites, our research found that experiences with the company can vary quite a bit from one policyholder to another. Trustpilot reviews tended to reflect negative experiences with some customers complaining about denied claims and slow response times. Better Business Bureau contributors similarly expressed frustration with inaccessible or unresponsive agents and claims adjusters. Although Allstate is not a BBB-accredited company, it does hold an A+ rating from the organization, which is the highest BBB rating possible and is based in part on both the number of complaints received and how the company responds to customer concerns. Allstate insurance claim reviews posted on Sitejabber largely focused on long wait times when customers filed claims and disappointment when claims were denied. Cleasurance reviewers were quite positive overall, with customers praising Allstate for its supportive representatives, extensive insurance coverage, and flexible payment options. Although negative reviews across some Allstate insurance rating sites shared fairly consistent themes regarding denied claims, it’s worth remembering that customers may be more likely to complain about a rejected claim than they would be to praise their insurance provider for settling a claim without a hitch. Customer experiences are highly subjective, and customer reviews often lack key details that may present a complete picture of what transpired between a policyholder and an insurance company. In addition, many Allstate auto claims reviews across different sites were submitted by contributors who did not have Allstate coverage themselves but were involved in accidents where the other driver had Allstate insurance, so their experiences may not accurately reflect the Allstate customer experience. As such, prospective customers should be careful about taking any Allstate review at face value, especially ones that are overly negative and one-sided. Allstate is one of the best homeowners insurance companies, but it excels with many different forms of insurance. The company sets itself apart from the competition in a number of ways, starting with availability. As a nationwide insurance carrier, Allstate can stack up with many providers across different types of insurance products. Homeowners, auto, and tiny-house insurance policies, among other plans, are readily available in all 50 states as well as Washington, D.C. Not even some of the most recognizable insurance brands can make the same claim. Nationwide, for instance, has a fairly large footprint of its own, but the company has some coverage gaps, offering homeowners insurance in 43 states and Washington, D.C. Allstate ratings from independent agencies are impressive as well. The company’s A+ rating from AM Best is the second-highest rating possible, reflecting a “superior” capacity to consistently deliver services to its customers. In comparison, American Family Insurance, which is a major insurance company in its own right, holds an A rating from the credit rating agency. Customers who shop around for the best rates may find that Allstate’s insurance premiums run a bit on the high side in some cases. Allstate customers may pay higher premiums on their homeowners insurance, for instance, but rates will vary depending on a policyholder’s location, risk profile, insurance type, and many other factors, so this won’t always be the case. Even with potentially higher rates, Allstate may offer a competitive total cost of coverage through insurance discounts. Bundling, in particular, is a key area where Allstate really stands out from the competition, thanks to its numerous multipolicy options that allow customers to bundle home, auto, condo, renters, motorcycle, ATV, and life insurance. The size of the bundling discount available is quite large as well, with eligible customers able to save as much as 25 percent on their insurance by bundling home and auto. Other large carriers may not be able to match Allstate when it comes to those savings; AARP offers home and auto bundles with discounts up to 10 percent. Given the significant discount available, it’s not surprising that Allstate offers one of the best home and auto insurance bundles in the nation. Allstate may be a great option for many customers looking for a variety of insurance products. Thanks to the company’s nationwide footprint, coverage is widely available for homeowners, auto, flood, mobile home, and tiny-house insurance, among other policies, in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C. Allstate may provide bundling discounts that can significantly reduce the cost of coverage and help save customers money on their insurance policy, especially with home and auto bundles. Eligible customers will want to try to take advantage of bundling discounts when they’re available, as Allstate’s rates may otherwise run a little high depending on the coverage terms selected and the policyholder’s risk profile. Allstate also provides a fairly strong digital experience with free online resources that can answer questions and address any confusion regarding insurance options, claims processes, and other aspects of coverage. The company’s online quote tool is easy to use, even for policies such as homeowners insurance that may require more extensive details to process a quote. With online customer portals, a mobile app, and virtual assistants, there are a variety of ways for digital-first policyholders to manage their policy and receive any help they require. Thanks to its nationwide availability, numerous bundling options, generous discount opportunities, and user-friendly online experience, Allstate has earned its prestigious reputation in the insurance industry. After reviewing all of their options, customers may find that Allstate is the best insurance provider to suit their specific situation, regardless of what type of insurance they need.
