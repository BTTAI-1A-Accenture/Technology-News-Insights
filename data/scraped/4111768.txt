With at least four cases of the new Covid strain being detected in India so far, concerns are arising over its impact in the country. The Omicron sub-variant BF.7 that is driving China's current surge of cases, has also been active in other countries, including the US, the UK, Japan, Hong Kong, Brazil and South Korea. With regards to the interconnected global supply chain, the automobile industry in India is taking a cautious and defensive approach. This time the industry seems better prepared and not as anxious as it was during the first wave in 2020. The companies feel safeguarded for a few months, however they are taking precautions and keeping a watchful eye on the changing dynamics in the country. The industry, which used to be one of the major revenue earners for the state, had come to a standstill in 2018 after the Supreme Court quashed 88 mining leases.
