CEBU, Philippines — After demolishing Hardwork Baller-Crusader of Bohol and OCCCI-Western Leyte College (WLC) of Ormoc, the red-hot cagers of Bacolod Tay Tung High School sustained their momentum to trounce Bentranco Bengals Bohol, 83-65, and stretch their perfect start to 3-0 in the SM-NBTC Visayas Qualifying Tournament yesterday at the Cebu City Sports Institute in Barangay Sawang Calero. But unlike their first two assignments, Tay Tung needed a strong second-half push this time to turn the tables on the upset-seeking Bentranco Bengals. Tay Tung trailed by six, 41-35, early in the third period but suddenly came alive, staging a fierce 26-11 counter-attack to seize the lead for good, 61-52. Tay Tung grew even hotter down the stretch on the way to thrash Bentranco by 18 points at the final buzzer. Nap Lawrence Aleligay sparkled with 25 points for Tay Tung. Joevan Felicidario added 17 points, four rebounds, two assists and eight steals, while Shannon Gray Sealey pulled down 13 rebounds to go with his seven points, four assists and two steals for the unbeaten Bacoleños. Meanwhile, the Sacred Heart School-Ateneo de Cebu (SHS-AdC) Team B and Black Shama Consolacion barged into the win column both at the expense of Hardwork Baller-Crusader. Ateneo de Cebu first downed the Hardwork Baller, 55-49, last Thursday afternoon. Sean Gabriel Uribe paced Ateneo with 14 points and seven rebounds followed by Ellieken Lim with 10 markers. Yesterday, it was Black Shama’s turn to clobber the Boholano ballers, 94-51. John Carlo Sabroso showed the way for Black Shama with 19 points, two rebounds, and four assists.
