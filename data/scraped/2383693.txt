People are reminded they have options, including shopping with competitive electric generation suppliers and exploring energy efficiency and conservation measures around their home or business. “The upcoming price changes, combined with the increased use of electricity that we typically see during the long, hot days of summer, make this a very good time for consumers to evaluate their energy options,” said PUC Chairman Gladys Brown Dutrieuille. Consumers should be aware of the pending price changes and understand the rates they will be paying. Additionally, they are encouraged to learn more about options for managing energy costs by exploring the Commission’s official electric shopping website, PAPowerSwitch.com, for details on competitive offers along with tips for energy conservation and savings. All Pennsylvania regulated electric utilities are adjusting their Prices to Compare on June 1 for residential and small business non-shopping customers. Customers not choosing a supplier continue to receive “default service” from the utility - with the utility setting a PTC per kilowatt hour (kWh) on a quarterly or semiannually basis. The PUC approves a utility’s electric generation procurement plan, however, the PUC does not regulate the price of the generation portion of the electric bill which is driven by wholesale market factors. The PTC averages 40% to 60% of the customer’s total utility bill. However, this percentage varies by utility and by the level of individual customer usage.
