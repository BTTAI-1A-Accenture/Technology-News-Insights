MINOT — Local officials Monday authorized ordering new heavy equipment needed by the town further in advance due to delivery delays. Town Administrator Danielle Loring said she briefed the Board of Selectmen this week that heavy equipment, such as snowplow trucks, will need to be ordered ahead of the regular schedule in the Capital Improvement Program. Until now, that truck would have been ordered at year 16 in the program, Loring said. She recommended that the schedule be moved up for heavy equipment items to year 14. Supply chain issues and computer chip shortages contributed to delays in delivery of those items, she said. Once the new truck has arrived, it will need to undergo modifications, which causes further delays before the equipment can be put into service, she said. “If we don’t get a new plow truck before snow falls this year, then the truck will be in its 19th year and on the road,” she said. By moving up the ordering schedule, Loring said the hope is to have the new equipment by year 16 before any maintenance issues become a concern. The town is updating its personnel policies regarding dress codes, disability accommodations and employee recognition, Loring said.
