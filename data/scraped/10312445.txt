             What's your go-to strategy for increasing organic reach on social media? 

I've found that leveraging user-generated content and writing in a conversational way rather than a formal manner has worked better. 

For example: not using any upper case letters, keeping it casual, using emojis, no formal tone.

What about you?

             FAQ: How do hashtags work? Hashtags categorize content by topic, making it discoverable by users interested in those subjects. When you add a hashtag to your post, it becomes searchable and can be seen by anyone following or searching that hashtag.

             One of the biggest benefits of developing an abundance approach to social media by publishing different, unique content to different platforms most of the time is organic growth. 

Sure I share the same updates to multiple groups at times but I do this infrequently. For the most part, I share unique updates to many different groups, pages and my profiles to experience organic growth. This is really the only type of growth you want as a blogger through social media because it means interested people visit your blog through these updates.

             A shocking >1000% decline in impressions on my LinkedIn  posts, despite adhering to all the advice on how to mix it with their algorithm. Dreadful. Effectively, none of my 10,000 followers see any of my stuff in their feed. They don't even get to decide for themselves if it is worth reading. I personally think that is disgusting. Something smells rotten here; clickbait works over serious content. Who else is experiencing such truly dramatic declines? 

Why should only 0.1% of my followers even see my content in their feed? Why else follow someone if not to see my content in their feed? They follow me to see my stuff. It's so stupid, dear LinkedIn. WTAF?

             What consumers want, give them that.

Imagine you're running a lemonade stand. You wouldn't just make whatever drink you like, right? 

You'd ask people what they're thirsty for and make lemonade accordingly.

Creating content is similar. 

You want to make things people are interested in. So, how do you find out what that is?

Look around. What are people talking about online? What are the trending hashtags?
 
Ask questions. Run polls on social media or ask your followers what they'd like to see more of.
 
See what's popular. What kind of content gets a lot of views and shares?

By understanding what people want, you can create content that resonates with them and keeps them coming back for more.
