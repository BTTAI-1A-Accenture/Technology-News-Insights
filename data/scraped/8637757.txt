AI, or artificial intelligence, is technology that attempts to simulate human cognitive function. AI has made its way into the software development space in a number of ways.

Failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures. Read about the latest observability content here Learn More In the past, the CI/CD pipeline was simply a place to integrate code. Developers would write their code in GitHub, pass it through the pipeline, and then deploy it. The pipeline has become a much more critical piece of the software delivery lifecycle today. Learn More Modern cloud-native applications, often leverage microservices, containers, APIs, infrastructure-as-code and more to enable speed in app development and deployment Learn More Sponsored By: Always On, Always Fast Deploy Distributed PostgreSQL in just 90 Seconds Learn More  The Importance of Security Testing With more development teams today using open-source and third-party components to build out their applications, the biggest area of concern for security teams has become the API. This is where vulnerabilities are likely to arise, as keeping on top of updating those interfaces has lagged. Read the Guide Here Mobile App Testing involves analyzing mobile apps for functionality, usability, visual appeal, and consistency across multiple mobile devices. It helps ensure an optimal user experience, irrespective of the device used to access the app. Learn More Today’s distributed software environments incorporate a variety of APIs with every interface your software touches, from mobile to microservices. Each API has to be continuously tested and verified to ensure your software functions as it should. Parasoft’s API testing platform makes quick, efficient, and intelligent work of such requirements. Learn More Ensure your application’s resilience, and make sure your software performs as expected under diverse operating conditions. (sponsored by Parasoft) Learn More    DevSecOps is the DevOps community’s approach to bringing security into the development lifecycle. Businesses want to deliver software, but cannot afford to release unreliable or insecure applications— therefore security needs to be baked in much sooner than it has traditionally been. Learn More Securing an application is just as important as building it in the first place. As data becomes more valuable, there are more people who want to steal it and use it for their own personal gain. Making sure applications are indeed secure has always been a challenge, as hackers try to stay one step ahead of defenders. Learn More Secrets are essential for integrating your infrastructure with databases and SaaS services. Doppler‘s developer-first security platform empowers teams to manage, orchestrate, and govern secrets across any environment. In 2023, there was an 18% decline in the number of open-source projects that are considered to be “actively maintained.” This is according to Sonatype’s Annual State of the Software Supply Chain Report. Learn More Development Managers need a different type of content than developers… They need to know what platforms, tools, trends, and issues they should be thinking about. SD Times delivers those unique topics here Learn More Agile software development has been around since the 1990s, but didn’t get the name until the famous meeting of 17 renowned software development thought leaders at Snowbird, Utah resulted in an Agile Manifesto. The idea behind Agile software development is to reduce time to market by enabling faster iterations of smaller segments of software. Learn More Value stream management involves people in the organization to examine workflows and other processes to ensure they are deriving the maximum value from their efforts while eliminating waste — of resources, time and assets. It is the practice that truly brings the business side and IT side together as partners in creating value for the organization. Learn More Learn More DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.

Learn More A fourth pillar has been erected in Embarcadero’s rapid application development tool set. Traditionally, the company’s rapid application development IDE, RAD Studio, has focused on C++, Delphi and .NET. But with the release of RAD Studio XE in early September, Embarcadero is adding PHP to that mixture, as well as new cloud-targeted deployment tools and some powerful third party tools. Mike Rozlog, Embarcadero’s RAD Studio product manager, said that XE focuses on easing deployment to both Amazon’s and Microsoft’s cloud environments. “We made it simple to interact with Microsoft’s Windows Azure platform, especially around tables, queues and blobs,” he said. “All I have to do is drop in a connection string, add a user name and password, then I can go out and create a brand new data stream. I can create a queue and just start putting messages into the queue and interacting with that.” That’s because RAD Studio XE automatically creates such queues and tables on the Windows Azure platform. Amazon Web Services, too, is supported for quick deployments of RAD applications, and Rozlog said that developers can push code to Amazon’s EC2 using little more than their Amazon credentials to spark the deployment. RAD Studio XE isn’t just about new deployment options, he said, as the four-IDE suite now includes a PHP IDE in addition to Delphi XE, C++Builder XE and Delphi Prism XE, the company’s .NET IDE. RAD Studio XE will be available to developers in early September; the company is not ready to reveal pricing. RadPHP XE, said Rozlog, “is basically a really fast way to develop native PHP code. It comes with its own set of 135 components for things like Google Maps, MySQL and Zend authentication components. Everything you write in the product is 100% PHP. It also includes debuggers and profilers, so you can take any PHP application and hit the ‘run debug’ button, and you can start pushing through code you wrote five years ago.” Additionally, RAD Studio XE includes third-party tools that Embarcadero felt were helpful to the RAD process. SmartBear’s AQtime code profiler is included, as is the Beyond Compare diff tool. Additionally, Embarcadero is included a logging operations library designed to allow developers to quickly drop logging functionality into existing applications. Embarcadero has also opened up the code behind its Subversion support in RAD Studio XE. The idea, said Rozlog, is to give developers the ability to see how the platform handles source-code management, and to allow developers to write their own SCM tools on top of the IDEs. Finally, Rozlog said RAD Studio XE will include a new system for helping developers control the build process. By choosing from a list of build functions, he said, developers using RAD Studio XE will be able to point and click their way through the process of creating complex build scripts.
