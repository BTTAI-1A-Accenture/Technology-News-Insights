South Main School. By Peter Kuebeck [email protected] The Bowling Green Historic Preservation Commission is discussing the potential for a listing on the local historic register for the former South Main School building. “The South Main School is a prime candidate, I think, for the benefits of preservation,” said HPC Chair Chris Mowen at the April meeting. “It’s one of our few remaining school buildings.” She noted that, per city ordinance, the process for buildings listing on the register individually and not as part of a historic district starts with the owner. “We would welcome conversation with this owner,” Mowen said, and to talk with them about the benefits of preserving the building. HPC Secretary Geoff Howes said that he has been in contact with the owner, who lives in California. “We can talk to the building owner about our stance as a historic commission why the preservation of this building is important,” Mowen said, “the benefits of preserving this building. Maybe we can change his mind about selling it, or maybe he’d be willing to list it before he sells it.” “It sounds like … he wants to see that building survive,” said HPC Vice Chair John Sampen, “and I don’t know how desperate he is to sell it but if we could get him to help us list it before he sells, that would be the safest way to help preserve the building. Anybody could buy that and tear it down and I’m concerned about that.” Howes said he would approach the owner on the subject. The HPC will next meet May 23 at 4 p.m. Mowen noted that the HPC will likely not have a meeting in July due to the transition from the current city building to the new building.
