 Couple of days days ago, Karri Saarinen, Founder of Linear got profiled by Lenny‚Äôs Newsletter. One of the things he mentions in the profile is how Linear does not have a full time product management function and someone from the feature team usually takes up that role for each feature. This of course led to the usual uproar on Twitter on how all Companies can pull this off, and no one needs PMs and PMs trying to defend their existence üòú I have discussed this topic many times in many smaller forums, so I thought it‚Äôs best to put some of that nuance out there and see what others feel, so here we go. Let's start by answering: What is the primary job to be done for the Product Management function? üßê I love the answer that Gibson Biddle (former VP/CPO at Netflix/Chegg) put out for this: "The job of Product Management is to Answer how the Company will delight customers, in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways." - Gibson Biddle I would like to make a very small modification and say it is to ‚ÄúAnswer how the Company will delight customers, in hard-to-copy, KPI-enhancing ways‚Äù as the Company's top KPI might not be margin at all stages - more on that later. Each of the three parts of that job to can be on a spectrum of say Low-Med-High complexity depending on the company's current context. Let's dig into each. Delighting Customers needs to begin with an understanding of what the customers' pain points are and would also involve creating solutions that solve those problems in a way that exceeds their expectations (and lead to Delight)! Knowing Customer pain points üïµÔ∏è This can be extremely low complexity if: The company is filled with builders who are exactly the customers they are building for. Why? Because, well, you can just solve your pain points and you will mostly get things right Builders come with deep multi-year expertise in the problem space and in the same customer segment. Why? Because you have already developed great intuition on both the customer and the possible solution directions If the customer count is such that each of those customers can be in a WhatsApp group AND if the customers you are building for are people who are able to articulate clearly their pain points. Why? Because you can just ask them (the Mom test way) and they will be able to tell you, and you are likely to get things right by doing this well. This is what makes B2B PMing simpler in this parameter (but complex in others) This will be high complexity if the opposite is true: The company does not have too many builders who are exactly like the customers. It's amazing how many times I have seen builders think they are like they are like customers, but they are not. It's also very common that builders started with a customer persona which was like them, but it is no longer true Builders are not coming with expertise in the problem and customer, and there is a lot of discovery work needed The count of customers is >10,000, very common in consumer companies Customers are not expected to be able to reliably articulate what their problems are, sometimes because they don't even know they had this problem Here is Casey Winter's 2x2 on what tools it takes to understand user problems based on user count and ability to articulate well (Sophistication)  Creating solutions that exceed expectations üöÄ Some factors that would make this Low complexity: The problem is totally unsolved, so just solving it, regardless of in what way, will exceed customer expectations The company has builders with prior experience building something similar so that there is minimal effort put into researching paths to solve Solutions in your problem space already exist, which you can make better with minimal research (e.g., by asking a low count of sophisticated customers) Solutions exist in adjacent problem spaces that you can take inspiration from Possible paths to solve are low and similar, and hence no major effort is needed to research paths with customers for tradeoffs Team size needed to solve the problem is small, so there is no major effort needed in keeping everyone on the same page Everyone solving the problem is extremely motivated, so there is no major effort in following up and nudging people along And all of this obviously becomes high complexity work if the opposite is true. Also called Defensibility/Moat and whatnot. This again is low complexity if the company already has many of the 7 powers of defensibility - Scale Economies, Network effects, Counter Positioning, Switching costs, Cornered resources, Brand and IP. If not, building each of them turns this into a high complexity work that someone needs to do. Also deciding which powers to build and in what order is also high complexity work. KPIs for a company at any given stage might be different. Super early stages: Proving the problem is real and the solution is good before money runs out. Early stages: Growth Scaleup: Sustainable Growth Large company: Predictable Growth with Margins Moving KPIs is low complexity if: The company is being run by builders for their own pleasure and there are no KPIs. Yolo üëª The company has made a choice to run the business without any pressure on KPIs- happens with private companies, who have no/low pressure from external stakeholders The company has a low complexity business that has very few inputs that influence the KPIs The company has done a spectacular job in delighting customers in hard-to-copy ways that your KPIs are going exactly where you want them to all the time The company has builders who are the perfect skill match for the kind of KPIs needed to be moved and able to make the right moves intuitively without much effort Competition is incompetent or non-existent All of this becomes high complexity work if the opposite is true. The answer is a classic Product Manager quip - "It depends." It depends on where the company is on the complexity spectrum of delighting customers in hard-to-copy KPI-Enhancing ways. Low in almost all of them? You can probably get someone to do it part-time from an adjacent function. High in almost all of them? Good luck without a full-time Product Management function. ü§ù Atlassian Platinum Solution Partner | IT Sales Manager (UK) Brijesh, thanks for sharing! Product | Growth | Operations | 0-1-10 builder Love how you could take all the 3 components of the answer and break it down from the lens of low complexity and high complexity! Amazing read, Brijesh Bharadwaj! üòÄ
