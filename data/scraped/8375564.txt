According to Zion Industry Research, the size of the consumer electronics industry is set to increase from $1.10 trillion in 2021 to $1.70 trillion by 2028, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 7.6%. China stands out as one of the largest manufacturers of consumer electronic goods. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on the industry, considering China’s position as the epi-centre of the virus. Regulations regarding social distancing and the closure of businesses led to a global reduction in the sales of electronics. For example, Sony’s Electronic Products and Solutions segment experienced a decline in revenue, with sales dropping from 977.4 billion yen ($7.09 billion) in the first half of 2019 to 836.5 billion yen ($6.07 billion) in the first half of 2020 due to retail stores closing down. In addition to Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), companies such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and LG also temporarily halted production in various countries to adhere to government regulations. However, one positive trend that emerged during the pandemic was the increased adoption of remote work, which led to a surge in demand for consumer electronics, particularly computing devices. In addition to the work-from-home trend, the preference for having connected homes is supporting the expansion of the consumer electronics industry. The convenience of enhanced features, such as voice assistance, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity, has led to a growing adoption of appliances equipped with these tools. According to a Value of Video Report 2020 issued by Grabyo, 58% of streaming customers surveyed reported frequent video consumption on a Smart TV. Furthermore, AI technologies and voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana are becoming increasingly prevalent. The market growth of consumer electronics has been further boosted by the increased demand for Asian electronic products in Western countries. According to data from The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association, the production value of computers and information terminals in Japan rose by 1251.3 billion yen ($9.07 billion) in 2019 from 1041.1 billion yen ($7.55 billion) in 2017. Additionally, the rising disposable income among the population in South-East Asian nations has led to increased consumption of home appliances. This trend is expected to drive the regional market growth in the next decade. The key players in the consumer electronics industry, such as Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (005930.KS), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) are investing heavily in research and development to introduce innovative products to cater to evolving consumer preferences and technological advancements. Meanwhile, government authorities are also actively taking initiatives to support the growth of electronics within their countries. For instance, the Government of India introduced the National Electronics Policy in 2018. The policy intends to provide a framework to achieve a turnover of $400 billion through consumer electronics manufacturing by the middle of this decade. Achieving such a significant number would surely require greater adoption of modern technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, and machine learning.

We used seven metrics, namely market share, brand recognition, consumer reviews and ratings, website rankings, product range, sales figures, and online presence, to evaluate the popularity of each brand. We referred to over 12 reputable sources, such as Value Today, Reddit threads, and GlobalData, to collate information regarding these metrics. The brands have been ranked in ascending order of their scores, with the maximum attainable score being 70. The methodology employed attempts to provide a holistic view of brand popularity, considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Total Score: 24 TTM Revenue: $28.03 billion Gree is a Zhuhai, China-based leading multinational business famous for its reliable consumer electronic products. With a focus on user-centric design, Gree offers a variety of smart and user-friendly devices.

Total Score: 25 TTM Revenue: $26.97 billion NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a notable player in the consumer electronics industry and excels in providing graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Renowned for their technological prowess, NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) consumer electronics power high-performance gaming, virtual reality experiences, autonomous vehicles, and data centre solutions. Here’s what RiverPark Advisors said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q1 2023 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA): NVDA shares were our next top contributor on better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. The stock also benefitted from the positive momentum around Artificial Intelligence and the Nvidia chips that drive it. While revenue was down -21% year over year, a rebound in the company’s gaming business helped drive revenue above Wall Street’s expectations. NVDA is the leading designer of graphics processing units (GPU’s) required for powerful computer processing. Over the past 20 years, the company has evolved through innovation and adaptation from a predominantly gaming-focused chip vendor to one of the largest semiconductor/software vendors in the world. Over the past decade, the company has grown revenue at a compound annual rate of over 20% while expanding operating margins and, through its asset light business model, producing ever increasing amounts of free cash flow. After working through its near-term slowdown, we expect future growth to remain robust as NVDA chips and software are critical to many of the core technologies being adopted globally, including cloud computing, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.” Total Score: 26 TTM Revenue: $284.61 billion  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) offers a variety of advanced consumer electronics through Google and other subsidiaries.

Shares of media and technology giant Alphabet outperformed as the company announced expense discipline while continuing to invest in its core products of Google Search, YouTube and Google Cloud.” Total Score: 27 TTM Revenue: $60.59 billion  International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a well-known player in the consumer electronics industry and offers advanced technology solutions. On April 16, International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) made an announcement regarding its acquisition of Polar Security, an innovative company specializing in the monitoring and security of cloud and software-as-a-service application data. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) was discussed in the Q4 2022 investor letter of Diamond Hill Capital. Here’s what the firm said: “New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.” Total Score: 28 TTM Revenue: $27.27 billion (¥3.71 trillion)  Fujitsu Limited (6702.T) is a Minato City, Tokyo-based conglomerate that provides a comprehensive selection of innovative products ranging from laptops and tablets to air conditioners and home appliances.

The company offers a diverse array of products, ranging from powerful processors and chipsets for PCs and laptops to solid-state drives and networking solutions. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock offers an annual forward dividend yield of 1.68% as of May 19. Here’s what ClearBridge Investments said about Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: “Also on the detractor side, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) delivered a disappointing revenue miss and lowered full-year revenue and earnings guidance as COVID-19-driven demand for PCs abated (where Intel enjoys half its sales) and a delay in its flagship Sapphire Rapids CPU hurt its data center business. Despite these issues, we still believe Intel is an economically sensitive turnaround story with substantial upside.” Total Score: 31 TTM Revenue: $12.62 billion  Nintendo Co., Ltd. (7974.T) is a pioneer in the gaming industry.

From the iconic Surface lineup of tablets and laptops to the Xbox gaming consoles and accessories, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) excels in producing premium gadgets and software solutions. Diamond Hill Capital shared its outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said: “We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Booking Holdings, all of which posted double-digit gains. Shares of software and IT services provider Microsoft rallied as investors became less cautious about the potential for growth deceleration in Azure, its public cloud business, and more focused on opportunities in search after the company announced an investment in and long-term partnership with OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT. Microsoft’s net cash balance sheet also seemed to gain appreciation from investors who became more cautious about the economic cycle.” Total Score: 39 TTM Revenue: $18.08 billion Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), commonly known as Philips, is a multinational conglomerate that operates in various industries, including consumer electronics. Philips offers a wide variety of consumer electronics, including televisions, audio systems, lighting solutions, personal care tools, and household appliances. Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG) was mentioned in the Q4 2022 investor letter of Artisan Partners. Here’s what the firm said: “Shares of Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), a health care technology company, were hurt by fears regarding the recall of its first-generation CPAP machine and the potential for legal recourse and market share losses arising in its sleep division. Adding to the company’s woes are supply chain disruptions and a worsening macro environment that will weigh on deliveries and customer installations. The stock is down more than 70%, losing more than €30 billion in market value from its April 2021 highs. The stock reaction seems excessive given the likely range of outcomes we see, so we’ve been adding to our position. The sleep division is a small part of the overall business—which we do not believe is going to zero. The company has a large installed base of medical diagnostic equipment (e.g., MRI/PET/CT/ultrasound scanners) that offers a high recurring stream of software-like maintenance revenues. This is a sticky business as medical providers are reluctant to switch over to competitors. We appreciate that until there is greater clarity on the full impact of the recall and how long it may take to resolve, the stock will remain under pressure, but we believe today’s asking price offers the potential for highly attractive multi-year returns.” Total Score: 40 TTM Revenue: $59.78 billion HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), or the Hewlett-Packard Company, is a Palo Alto, California-based consumer electronics giant known for its laptops, desktop computers, printers, scanners, and accessories.
