More Nebraskans who are visually impaired can get access to a key piece of technology for free, through the Nebraska Library Commission's Talking Book and Braille Service. A local nonprofit is teaching them how to use that technology, also free of charge. Outlook Enrichment provides free training on a variety of braille displays for visually impaired people. The Omaha nonprofit says on average, there are 8-9% of people across the country who use braille as their main way to read information. And that hasn't changed much over the years. "What has changed is the technology that's allowing people to access it quickly," said Paulette Monthei, executive director of Outlook Enrichment. Mickie Saltzman spends his days showing people how to use refreshable braille e-readers, which just came out in 2022. "It's kind of small, so it's very compact. It's not very heavy to carry around," Saltzman said. "I can use the Kindle app on my phone to read Kindle books and iBooks and yet, I can also — because it's connected to my braille display — I'm reading it with the braille display." The devices can cost around $3,000 to $5,000. But through the Nebraska Library Commission's Talking Book and Braille Service, library patrons can get the refreshable braille e-readers for free. "If we can download these books onto our braille displays, that only makes it a lot easier and a lot better for people. And it's faster," Saltzman said. Monthei said this is part of a bigger effort, nationwide. "They have looked at the national level on ways they can make braille more readily available to individuals with vision loss," Monthei said. She hopes advancements like these displays can do just that.
