Kenya Airways has increased its flagship Nairobi to London Heathrow route to double daily every day this winter. It is its highest-ever frequency and rises from the present 10 weekly – a massive 40% increase – and daily in winter 2019. It is not yet clear from which carrier it has leased the coveted Heathrow slots and whether it will continue next summer or be winter seasonal. It will compete directly with British Airways' daily Airbus A350-1000 Nairobi service.
                         It would be easy to conclude that Kenya Airways, which is not known for good performance, is increasing capacity unnecessarily. After all, adding four extra weekly flights with its only widebody type – the Boeing 787-8, each with 234 seats – means an additional 1,872 roundtrip seats each way every week.

                         But the increase probably makes good sense. After all, the London-Nairobi point-to-point demand is huge, with around 149,000 passengers between January and July 2023. Then, there is significant inbound winter tourist demand to places like Mombasa and Zanzibar.
                         It will also be better able to target Johannesburg passengers from the continued absence of South African Airways, previously a major player. And, of course, Kenya Airways can be more competitive from London to other big Anglophile cities in Southern Africa as Ethiopian Airlines will have 10 weekly London-Addis Ababa flights from the November launch of London Gatwick.
