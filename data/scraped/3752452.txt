Distance learning provides a flexible, accessible and often affordable option for many students who need to juggle, school, work and other obligations. However, online learning presents unique challenges to consider before enrolling. A major point to keep in mind is that distance learning requires self-discipline and strong time-management skills. Online programs can be delivered synchronously, asynchronously or as a combination of both. Synchronous programs involve real-time interaction and collaboration, which is ideal if you prefer more structured learning. Asynchronous programs are self-paced and let you access course materials at your convenience, which can be a better option if you need more flexibility. Budget is also important to consider when researching prospective schools and programs. Online programs can eliminate costs associated with on-campus living and commuting. Tuition rates for online programs also tend to be similar or lower than those of in-person programs. There are also some schools that offer flat-rate tuition for all students no matter their residency status or have other tuition deals. If you’re looking for a cost-effective educational option, an online program could be a good choice. Accreditation should also be a priority to check for when you’re researching schools and programs. This is a comprehensive review process that evaluates educational institutions and programs to determine if they meet specific quality standards and criteria. The accreditation process guarantees you’ll receive a quality education in line with rigorous professional and academic standards. There are two primary levels of accreditation: institutional and programmatic. Institutional accreditation assesses an entire college or university. Accrediting bodies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation evaluate a college or university’s mission, finances, academic programs, faculty, student outcomes and student support services. Programmatic accreditation focuses on specific academic programs or schools within an institution. This level of accreditation ensures programs meet industry-specific standards and effectively prepare students for careers in their chosen fields. ABET is the primary accreditor for computing programs in the U.S. Many employers prefer—or even require, in some cases—graduates from ABET-accredited programs. Determining your career goals before enrolling in an online degree program can help you find one that aligns with your objectives. Your program should focus on developing both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Take time to research a program’s curriculum, including its elective and specialization or concentration offering. This is especially important if you’re interested in a specific area of computer programming, such as mobile app development, cybersecurity, data science or artificial intelligence. Specialized coursework allows you to tailor your studies toward your interests and goals. If you value experiential learning, plan to enter the workforce directly after graduating or want to continue your education, consider what type of practical learning opportunities are offered through your program. For example, this might include internships, practicum, hands-on capstone projects and research opportunities. Students planning to attend graduate school should seek programs that cover foundational concepts and advanced topics. Be sure to double-check the requirements for specific graduate programs—including the prerequisites and any specific undergraduate coursework—so you can plan accordingly. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average undergraduate tuition and fees for full-time students during the 2022–2023 academic year was $14,688. A bachelor’s degree typically takes four years of full-time study, making the average cost of the entire degree $58,752. Comparatively, the average cost for the online computer programming degrees featured in this ranking is around $56,970—slightly below the national average. Several factors can impact the cost of earning a computer programming degree online, including enrollment status, residency status and whether an institution is public or private. Many financing options exist for students enrolled in online degree programs. Submitting the FAFSA® is a great way to determine your eligibility to receive federal financial aid. Federal aid can include the following: Additional financial aid options are available, including: Yes, it’s possible to earn a computer programming online degree. Every computer programming degree program featured in this article can be earned entirely online. The difficulty of a computer programming degree depends on your skills and strengths as well as the rigor of your program. Programming involves learning various programming languages, tools and frameworks along with abstract concepts like algorithms, data structures and logic.   Despite its challenges, earning a computer programming degree can be achievable for students willing to put time and effort into their studies. The time it takes to earn a degree in computer programming varies by program and your educational path. An associate degree in computer science takes around two years to complete and can be a stepping stone toward a bachelor’s degree or entry-level position. A bachelor’s degree in computer science typically takes four years of full-time study.
