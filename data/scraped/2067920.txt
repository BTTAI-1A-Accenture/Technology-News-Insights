Popular US flight operator American Airlines is continuing its venture into more sustainable air travel by increasing its investment in Hydrogen-electric aviation technology developer ZeroAvia. Building off a previous Memorandum of Understanding, American has also (conditionally) committed to purchasing 100 hydrogen-electric plane engines from ZeroAvia for regional flights. Hydrogen-electric plane aviation technology developer ZeroAvia is exploring a form of energy-dense fuel to develop aircraft that can refuel faster and potentially fly farther. The company has signed a memorandum of understanding with hydrogen tech startup Verne to co-develop the plane integrations. Hydrogen-electric plane technology developer ZeroAvia announced it has signed an agreement with the newly launched, carbon-conscious airline EcoJet to provide up to 70 zero-emission plane engines. With ZeroAvia’s help, Ecojet looks to become the world’s first all-electric airline. Hydrogen-electric plane developer ZeroAvia has snagged some additional financial security as it looks to continue development of its zero-emissions flight technology that should one day enable flights in 76-seat aircrafts. The latest financing round featured some familiar names as well as some leading investments from Airbus, Barclays, and Saudi Arabia’s “living laboratory,” NEOM. Zero emission aircraft powertrain developer H2FLY is celebrating a major milestone in what it is hailing as a world’s first. The company has successfully piloted a flight of an electric aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen rather than gas, opening a new door of opportunity for zero-emissions long distance flights.  Autonomous freight aircraft developer Natilus has announced it will offer ZeroAvia’s ZA600 hydrogen-electric engine as a propulsion option on its blended wing body (BWB) cargo plane. The two aviation companies have formed a strategic partnership to jointly-develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flown entirely by hydrogen-electric propulsion.  Hydrogen-electric plane developer ZeroAvia has received delivery of a 76-passenger plane from Alaska Airlines it can now retrofit with zero-emissions technology as promised years ago. Furthermore, the company’s advancements in modular motor systems could enable test flights of the plane sooner than you’d think. Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt is taking its technology to the skies, announcing a new program surrounding lightweight, energy-dense lithium metal cells and modules to support electric aviation. The electric plane battery development is already underway through Northvolt’s subsidiary Cuberg, which has some milestones to share. The world’s largest battery maker continues to showcase why it’s the name to beat in its given segment. During the Shanghai Auto Show, CATL launched a new condensed battery that delivers the proper safety and energy density to enable the flight of electric passenger planes. If this technology sounds like it’s still several years away, think again – CATL expects to begin mass production sooner than you’d think. Electric aviation company BETA Technologies has been quietly working on some impressive zero-emissions aircraft technology and is now sharing its achievements with the world. Today, BETA announced plans to produce and certify its CX300 fixed-wing electric plane, which has already flown over 22,000 test miles and undergone evaluation flights for FAA certification. Watch this eCTOL takeoff in the video below. Mere weeks after achieving experimental airworthiness certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Universal Hydrogen has successfully taken its 40-passenger regional hydrogen electric plane to the skies. The aircraft took off from Washington state this morning and ascended to an altitude of 3,500 mean sea level (MSL) before safely landing, as you can see in the video below.  Zero-emission aviation developer Universal Hydrogen has shared video footage of its 40+ passenger hydrogen fuel cell plane testing ground handing ahead of its first-ever flight. The video comes with bigger news that the company has received an experimental airworthiness certification from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to take flight. When it does, it is expected to become the largest hydrogen electric powered aircraft to ever do so. Zero emission powertrain developer H2FLY has announced a joint project alongside Stuttgart Airport to develop and erect a Center for Excellence in Hydrogen Aviation. Together, the aviation teams will implement a purpose-built facility at the airport specifically designed to support hydrogen electric plane testing for passenger flights. A UK-based aviation project called NUNCATS has successfully completed the maiden flight of its all-electric plane, described as an “electric sky jeep.” Looking ahead, the project’s goal is to expand the availability of healthcare by transporting doctors, medical supplies, and other cargo to remote parts of the world with zero emissions, helping save lives. Less than a month after receiving a permit to fly from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), hydrogen-electric plane developer ZeroAvia has successfully completed the first flight of its 19-passenger aircraft. It’s maiden flight marks the record for the largest aircraft in the world to be powered by a hydrogen-electric engine, representing a huge moment for clean aviation. Hydrogen-electric plane developer ZeroAvia has come one step closer to performing the first test flight of its hydrogen electric plane equipped with a 600kW powertrain. The company has received a permit from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to takeoff soon. Seaplane airline Harbour Air continues to make progress toward making its entire fleet of planes electric by successfully completing its first point-to point test flight in Canada. The eBeaver electric plane flew 45 miles with plenty of reserve power left when it landed. Hydrogen-electric plane developer ZeroAvia announced it has garnered an additional $30 million in funding from both new and returning investors, including International Airlines Group (IAG). The aviation company’s Series B funding round now totals $68 million, which will be used to get its forty to eighty seat planes into operation by 2026. Rolls-Royce Holdings has publicly claimed it believes its Spirit of Innovation all-electric plane is the fastest electric vehicle in the world, following three new speed records. The flight data has been submitted to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) with the hopes the organization will soon certify and officially confirm these world records. Alaska Air Group, the parent company of Alaska Airlines, is collaborating with ZeroAvia to develop a hydrogen-electric powertrain that will be implemented on a 76 passenger plane. When completed, the ZA2000 hydrogen-electric powertrain should boast 2,000-5,000 kW of power with a 500-mile range. As a new investor in ZeroAvia, Alaska Air plans to electrify its aviation to meet its goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040.  The Spirit of Innovation, a Rolls-Royce all-electric airplane, is scheduled to take flight for the first time soon, and will be towed around the tarmac by a Jaguar I-Pace as a support vehicle. Rolls-Royce plans to attempt a world record flight with the Spirit of Innovation by reaching a target flight speed of over 300 mph.  North America’s largest seaplane airline, Harbour Air, announced a partnership with magniX and H55 to produce what it is calling “the world’s first certified all-electric commercial airplane.” The new partnership will continue to develop and certify its electric Beaver (eBeaver) commuter plane through a supplemental type certificate (STC) program in Canada. An electric plane has crash-landed into a lake in Norway earlier this week in another blow to the current effort to electrify flight.

Close SunPower isn’t just powering roofs and solar farms these days. The company, which touts its solar panels as the most durable and efficient on the market, is looking at other applications. I’d be hard pressed to find one as awesome as the upcoming Mission SolarStratos expedition which will be powered by its 22-24% efficient Maxeon™ solar cells.
