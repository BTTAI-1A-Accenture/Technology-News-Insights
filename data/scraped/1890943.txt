ARLINGTON, VA — A Washington, D.C., man, who bought a Virginia Lottery ticket at a Harris Teeter grocery store in Arlington, won the Livin’ Lucky with Luke Combs game’s top prize of $200,000. “I thought I was going to have a heart attack,” Kevin Pullins told Virginia Lottery officials as he claimed his prize. “I wanted to make sure it was real.” Pullins told lottery officials he typically buys tickets for the whole week on Monday. He recently did that and had a little bit left over, so he bought a Livin’ Lucky with Luke Combs ticket. When he got home and scratched the ticket, he discovered he had won the game’s $200,000 top prize. Pullins bought his winning ticket at the Harris Teeter at 900 Army Navy Drive in Arlington. He said he was attracted to the game because it was new and had the highest top prize of all the games in front of him. Livin’ Lucky with Luke Combs is one of dozens of scratcher games available from the Virginia Lottery. It features prizes ranging from $5 up to the $200,000 top prize. This is the first top prize claimed in this game; two more $200,000 tickets are unclaimed. Pullins, who works in the medical profession, said he plans to use his winnings to pay off his vehicle and do some home renovations. The chances of winning that top prize are 1 in 1,387,200. The chances of winning any prize in this game are 1 in 4.01. All Virginia Lottery profits go to K-12 education in Virginia. Pullins bought the ticket in Arlington, which received more than $4.9 million in Lottery funds for K-12 education last fiscal year. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.
