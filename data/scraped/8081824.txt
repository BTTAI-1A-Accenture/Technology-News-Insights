					When News Matters, It Matters Where You Get Your News.				 The St. Mary’s County Health Department (SMCHD) announced that it will now offer a new bivalent formulation of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines for use as a single booster dose for certain children aged six months and older in accordance with updated authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.



The updated booster vaccine enhances protection against severe infection from the original coronavirus strain as well as the newer Omicron variants that account for most current cases. Children aged six months to four years who completed the three-dose primary series with the monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine over two months ago are now eligible to receive a single booster dose of the Pfizer bivalent vaccine.
