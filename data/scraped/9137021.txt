And Stephanie we’re obviously fairly excited about the opportunity for offshore, especially seeing how early we are in the development of that lever for margin optimization. But we’re equally excited about the potential for automation. And frankly, we’re probably a little bit earlier in the game there than we are on the automation side. We still have a lot of business processes within TruBridge that need to be streamlined and consolidated to make them good candidates for automation. So, we’ve got a lot of righting the ship internally process-wise to do to really take advantage of those opportunities, but they’re there and we’re very early in that ball game right now. Stephanie Davis: Thanks as always. Christopher Fowler: Thank you, Stephanie. Operator: There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Chris for any closing comments. Christopher Fowler: Absolutely. Thanks again for everybody joining today and for your continued interest in CPSI. I hope everybody has a wonderful week. And Matt, Happy Valentine’s Day, buddy. Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.
