Clean up the competition in the Bleach-inspired game. Peroxide is a popular Roblox game inspired by the hit anime series Bleach. The action RPG boasts a huge world to explore, and a deep combat system that lets you recreate the epic, super-charged fights you would have seen in the anime. Like Type Soul, which is also inspired by Bleach, players can follow in the footsteps of Ichigo Kurosaki and become a Soul Reaper, or they can turn to the dark side and play as a Hollow. To help customise your character just the way you like, you'll need plenty of Product Essence. This in-game currency is needed to reroll classes and cosmetics, and usually you would have to farm for it. But if you want to save yourself plenty of time you can just redeem a couple of Peroxide codes, which dish out plenty of Product Essence. Not sure how to redeem codes in Peroxide? Here's what you need to do: If the code you entered is active then the text in the textbox will change, showing you what goodies you've redeemed for free. But if the code is no longer working then an error message will appear instead. Codes for Roblox games are time sensitive, so if you see a code you like the look of for Peroxide don't delay in redeeming it. Just finished a game of Peroxide and looking for something else to play on Roblox?
