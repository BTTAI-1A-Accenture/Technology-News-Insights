 FC Cincinnati have reached a milestone moment by winning the 2023 Supportersâ Shield, climbing from Major League Soccerâs basement to peak. The Shield â awarded annually to the team with the most regular-season points â accentuates Cincyâs transformation under head coach Pat Noonan and general manager Chris Albright, an ex-Philadelphia Union duo now in their second full season in charge. This great leap forward, mathematically sealed via a 3-2 win at Toronto FC on Saturday evening, follows three straight Wooden Spoon finishes for Cincy from 2019-21 (last place overall) upon joining MLS as an expansion team.

The Orange & Blue, who were already guaranteed to compete in the 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup, can still surpass the single-season points record that the New England Revolution (73) set in 2021. They have 65 points (19W-4L-8D record) with three games remaining in the buildup to Decision Day on Oct. 21. The protagonist in Cincyâs rise is captain and midfielder Luciano Acosta, whoâs compiled a Landon Donovan MLS MVP-caliber season. The Argentine No. 10 is one of three Designated Players alongside defensive midfielder Obinna Nwobodo and striker Aaron Boupendza; the latter was signed midseason after Brennerâs big-money transfer to Italian Serie A side Udinese. Beyond that trio, several domestic standouts â goalkeeper Roman Celentano, center back Matt Miazga and striker Brandon Vazquez â are also vital pieces. Acosta, Miazga and left wingback Ãlvaro Barreal were all 2023 MLS All-Stars. This first MLS-era trophy follows Cincy's first postseason berth in 2022, when they made the Eastern Conference Semifinals before losing to Philadelphia.
