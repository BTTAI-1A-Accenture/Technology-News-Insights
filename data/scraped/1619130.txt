The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Communications has asked local mobile network operators to review their collaboration with six foreign enterprises providing paid cross-border radio and television services in Vietnam. The six service providers include the U.S.’s Netflix, Apple, and Amazon and China’s Tencent, IQIYI, and Hunan. The review is to assess their compliance with Vietnam’s regulations and make sure that the cooperation between Vietnamese mobile carriers and cross-border service providers does not unintentionally create conditions for foreign firms to violate Vietnamese law. Foreign broadcasting service providers must have licenses to provide the services in Vietnam, the Authority of Broadcasting and Electronic Information under the Ministry of Information and Communications cited Government Decree 71 amending and supplementing some articles of Decree 06/2016/ND-CP on the management, provision, and use of radio and television services. The management and monitoring of the operations of foreign companies providing paid cross-border radio and television services in Vietnam will thereby be enhanced.  Netflix has confirmed that it will supply paid cross-border television services in Vietnam. IQIYI, Tencent, and Apple will adjust their operations to screen movies online in Vietnam, while Hunan and Amazon will not offer paid television services in the Southeast Asian country. Therefore, the Ministry of Information and Communications sought the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism’s coordination to manage the screening of movies online by Netflix, Apple, Tencent, and IQIYI. The Departments of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of all provinces and cities are required to review and reject the advertising and promotion of services of such entities if they fail to comply with Vietnam’s prevailing regulations or to obtain a license to provide paid radio and television services.
