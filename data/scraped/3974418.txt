SHERLOCK star Benedict Cumberbatch has bought an £8.1million mansion with 355 acres of land. The actor and wife Sophie Hunter agreed a deal on the country spread last May after eyeing it for two years. Sources say the Somerset estate, which has an organic farm and cider orchard, is “totally private”. The historic house has a Grade-II listed lodge built to impress King George III, who was a regular visitor in the late 1700s. Cumberbatch, 46, distantly related to Richard III, also has a Gothic–style entrance arch, library and wine cellar to show off. A source said: “It’s really lovely, secluded and peaceful, perfect for getting away from it all.  “Although the house is historic, it has all mod-cons.  “Locals in the nearby village know about the purchase. “Everyone is excited about their new neighbours.” Cumberbatch, who played Holmes in Sherlock, also has a home in London with theatre director, playwright and actress Sophie, 44. The property was sold by estate agents Savills.  The Land Registry has only recently released the documents. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF.
