They said skyrocketing premiums are putting a strain on their budget, and they believe it will push families out of the state.  Insurance Commissioner Jim Donelon, State Sen. Royce Duplessis, and State Sen. Cameron Henry were on the panel. They encouraged residents to call or email their office with solutions, saying this is one of the biggest issues their constituents are calling them about.  "It's not a fix-all. We will continue to battle this problem every session. However frustrated you are, appreciate the fact that we are equally frustrated, if not more," Henry said.  "I believe there's going to have to be a wholesale restructure of how we deal with insurance in places like Louisiana, places like Florida. It's going to require federal government intervention or some type of restructuring because the way we're doing this right now, in my opinion, is not sustainable," Duplessis said.
