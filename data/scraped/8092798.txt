Ever feel like V was under surveillance? Well... Warning: Spoilers for Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty lie ahead. One of the endings to Cyberpunk 2077’s Phantom Liberty expansion is coated in the fingerprints of one of the base game’s most enigmatic characters, and players keep finding more evidence showing just how deep his claws dig into the game’s world. Before we go any further, if you’re yet to finish the DLC and don’t want to see any potential spoilers for it, make sure you’ve heeded the warning above. Still here? Good. A lot of cybersleuths have recently been busy tracking down the various bits of extra dialogue you can easily miss if you don’t try and go rocket-surfing or play through the game’s main quest after finishing the DLC. Meanwhile, some have been digging a bit further into the presence that one of Night City’s most mysterious residents has in the ending to Phantom Liberty which sees V side with Songbird. I picked said ending during my very first playthrough of the expansion and, while this might have been because it was pretty late at night by the time I reached the spaceport in which the mission in question, dubbed ‘The Killing Moon’, is set, I don’t remember noticing that I was being watched. Though, as one player on Reddit has spotted, from the moment I turned up to meet Songbird at the start of the mission, that’s exactly what was happening. The aptly-named “suspicious homeless man” they’ve clocked in the alley where you find the ailing netrunner is the latest evidence that proves just how involved Mr Blue Eyes is in this particular conclusion to the DLC. For the uninitiated, Mr Blue Eyes pops up during the base game quest ‘Dream On’, which sees you uncover that Night City’s political spheres are under the influence of some unknown force, which players theorise could be a rogue AI, as well as during one of the main quest’s endings. Players noticed that he also shows up in person during this particular Phantom Liberty mission not long after the expansion’s release (thanks, Forbes), as you can see in the video above. It’s also been assumed that he’s likely the mystery benefactor Songbird says is responsible for funding and organising her escape to the moon. The sheer amount of other blue-eyed NPCs lurking in the background of the mission, especially this latest one to emerge, shows just how deep that organisation potentially goes, with a goon even having been dispatched to keep tabs on Songbird and you prior to your arrival at the spaceport. What this could all mean and what Blue Eyes’ true motives are remain unknown at this point, but maybe all will be revealed in Cyberpunk’s sequel. Ironically, Phantom Liberty also includes some lines which were created with the help of non-rogue (we hope) AI technology, in order to replicate the voice of a deceased actor who starred in the base game.
