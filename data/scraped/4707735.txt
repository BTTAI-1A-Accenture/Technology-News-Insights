                 CEO Benioff is also attempting to bring back executives who left to join rivals such as Amazon and Oracle. — Reuters NEW YORK: Salesforce Inc chief executive officer Marc Benioff has made several changes at the business software maker’s top ranks and is attempting to bring back executives who left to join rivals such as Amazon and Oracle, news website Insider reports, citing a memo. Miguel Milano, who moved back from Celonis, has been appointed Salesforce’s chief revenue officer, according to the Insider report, which added that Ariel Kelman, previously the chief marketing officer at Amazon Web Services and Oracle, has been named the new chief marketing officer. President and chief operating officer Brian Millham will be taking on a host of new responsibilities, including employee success and business technology, the memo said. Salesforce did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Earlier this year, Salesforce said it plans to cut jobs by 10% and close some offices, after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce amid an economic slowdown. — Reuters
