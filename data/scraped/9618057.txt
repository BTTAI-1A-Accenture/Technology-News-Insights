A H2 View subscription provides you with unparalleled insight, analysis and comment around the hydrogen economy, including: Tokamak Energy has today released the first images of its commercial fusion power plant, which aims to generate enough electricity to power 50,000 UK homes in the 2030s. Fusion power plants can be connected to a traditional turbine to produce electricity as well as provide heat for multiple industrial uses, including metalworks, water desalination or hydrogen production. They will generate a lot of power from a small amount of fuel and take up small amounts of land, compared to solar and wind farms. Tokamak claims 1kg of fusion fuel releases the same amount of energy as burning around 10 million kg of coal, with no harmful emissions. Its ST-E1 fusion pilot plant will demonstrate the capability of delivering electricity into the grid in the early 2030s and pave the way for globally deployable 500-megawatt commercial plants. They can be built next to large populations and centres of industry where power and heat is needed. ... to continue reading you must be subscribed To gain access to this article and all our other content, you will need to subscribe to H2 View.
