 Aetna offers HMO and EPO Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans in these states: Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah, Texas and Virginia. Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website Via Healthcare.com’s website There are several steps you can take to find the best medical insurance for your needs: The tables below show examples of health insurance costs for Bronze, Silver and Gold plans from the best health insurance companies in our analysis. On a tight budget? How to save money on health insurance How much you pay for health insurance depends on your age as well as the age of any additional individuals, children or adults, on your plan. The table below provides an example of how much you may pay for coverage on an unsubsidized ACA plan. All Health Insurance Marketplace, or Marketplace, health insurance plans that are compliant with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) must cover these 10 essential benefits: Specific services within these categories can vary depending on your state’s requirements. Plans can also provide adult dental or vision coverage and medical management programs, such as those that assist plan members with back pain, diabetes and weight management. Plan benefits can also vary by insurance company. It’s important to read the fine print to determine what each health insurance plan covers and excludes. If you’re getting health coverage for someone 18 or younger, dental coverage is an essential benefit under ACA-compliant health insurance plans. That means it must be available as part of a health plan or as a separate dental plan. Adult dental care is not an essential benefit, however, so your health insurance may not cover dental, depending on your plan.  Some plans include dental, meaning the premium covers both health care and dental. But if your plan doesn’t cover dental, you might be able to buy dental insurance separately through the Marketplace. If you do, you’ll have a premium for your health insurance plan and another for your dental plan. You can choose between two categories of dental insurance through the Marketplace: low and high.  Looking for dental coverage? The best dental insurance Although health insurance plans can vary, according to Shashank Agarwal, senior decision scientist for CVS Health, health insurance may not cover: Your health plan might also exclude coverage for fertility treatments, brand-new technologies or off-label drug use. “There may also be limitations or exclusions relating to pre-existing conditions, dental care, vision care and long-term care,” said Bullock. While most health insurance plans cover rehabilitative care, they might not cover developmental services, warns Adam Rosenfeld, president of Rubicon Benefits, a division of World Insurance. Although your physical therapy following knee surgery would be covered, speech therapy for your child born with developmental delays may not, he explains. Just like plan benefits can vary by coverage level and insurance company, so can policy exclusions. Comparing plan benefit details, especially what’s excluded from coverage, can help you determine which plan is best for your health care needs. There are several types of health insurance plans in the Marketplace, many of which may be offered in your area at each metal tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum). You can apply for health insurance coverage in several ways, including online, by phone, through an agent or broker or with a paper application. Where you secure health insurance will determine the exact application process.  You can get health insurance from a number of sources, including: Open enrollment for the federal health insurance exchange runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 15. However, some states have their own health insurance exchange and enrollment periods in those states can vary. Use the table below for state-based enrollment details and always check with your state for the most recent health insurance enrollment guidance.  If you need health insurance outside of the open enrollment period, you may be able to enroll under certain circumstances, such as if you experienced a major life change, like marriage or the birth of a child, have an income that qualifies for a Special Enrollment Period or if you qualify for Medicaid or CHIP.  Methodology We analyzed insurers that sell individual health insurance plans to determine the best health insurance companies. Each health insurance company was eligible for up to 100 points, based on its performance in the following key categories: 
If you’d like to dig in deeper, head over to our health insurance ratings methodology page. Via Healthcare.com's website Provider network 23,900+ physicians in 39 hospitals and 622 medical facilities. NAIC complaint level Very low Via Healthcare.com's website Provider network More than 1 million providers NAIC complaint level Low The Health Insurance Marketplace’s open enrollment period generally runs from Nov. 1 through Jan. 15 each year, but the exact enrollment period can vary by state. For instance, 2024 enrollment in California, New York, Rhode Island and Washington D.C., ends on Jan 31, while enrollment in Idaho starts on Oct. 15 and ends on Dec. 15.  If you enroll by Dec. 15, your health insurance coverage begins on Jan. 1, when your first health insurance premium payment is due. If you don’t need your health insurance coverage to start until Feb. 1, you can enroll until Jan. 15.  There are multiple reasons why health insurance is so expensive, said Shashank Agarwal, senior decision scientist for CVS Health. Administrative and medical care costs, prescription drug prices, lifestyle factors, an aging population, mandates and regulations, risk pool dynamics and complex billing and pricing impact how much each person pays for health insurance. “Drugs used to account for less than 10% of overall health care plan costs, and now it’s over 25%,” said Adam Rosenfeld, president of Rubicon Benefits, a division of World Insurance. A lack of tort reform laws and the ability to revise, renew and extend patents to keep drug prices up also factor into higher health insurance costs. Find a plan that suits your budget: Best cheap health insurance There are no federal laws that require health insurance, but California, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, D.C. require residents to declare proof of health insurance coverage on state taxes. Even if you don’t live in a state that requires proof of medical insurance coverage, most Americans should consider health insurance if they can’t afford to pay for health care out of pocket. Having health insurance can help you pay for preventative care, which can keep you happier and healthier longer.  Comparing the cost of health insurance plans and your out-of-pocket expenses to paying for care on your own can help determine if you need health insurance. The best health insurance company is Kaiser Permanente, which gets 5 stars in our rating. Aetna is also a top-scoring health insurance company in our analysis, based on cost, coverage options, NCQA quality rating and consumer complaints. There is no federal law that you have to have health insurance, but a handful of states require it.  California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C. require residents to have health insurance and will apply a state tax penalty if you don’t (except for Vermont, which does not apply a penalty). Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare have extensive networks, making it easier to get in-network health care anywhere in the country.
