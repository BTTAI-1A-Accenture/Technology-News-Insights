A driver lost control and crashed into a Philadelphia police station across the street from the site where another car ran into a cell phone store earlier in the week, news reports said. The crash happened just after 1 a.m. Friday at the 35th police district headquarters on the 5900 block of North Broad Street, near West Champlost Avenue, in the Ogontz section of the city. Authorities reported the 25-year-old driver of a Mitsubishi hit an unoccupied police vehicle and the steps to the police station. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and no arrests were made, according to 6ABC. The investigation is now active and ongoing with the Crash Investigation Division. If you can recall, earlier this week on Tuesday a driver went through a T-Mobile store across the street from the 35th district station during a police chase where the driver was speeding. The vehicle then crashed into a T-Mobile store, sending glass and metal flying. The suspect got away but after a pursuit, police eventually nabbed him and took him into custody.
