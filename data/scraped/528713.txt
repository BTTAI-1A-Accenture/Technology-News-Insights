			Trending:		 We all assume the rule “you break it, you buy it” applies to everyone. But oftentimes, the government behaves like it does not apply to them. A new lawsuit filed by a North Hollywood businessman seeks to establish that rule applies to everyone, including law enforcement. On Wednesday, NoHo Printing and Graphics owner Carlos Pena teamed up with the Institute for Justice (IJ) to file a federal lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles seeking compensation after a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) SWAT team destroyed his business in August 2022.  Carlos has owned and operated his screen-printing business for 31 years, printing shirts, hats, banners and signs for people and organizations throughout the Los Angeles area. In August 2022, Carlos was working inside his shop when he heard a commotion coming from outside, so he went to the door to see what was happening. His store was surrounded by police vehicles and a helicopter was flying overhead. Suddenly, a man came running toward Carlos, shoved him to the ground, forced his way inside Carlos’ business and locked Carlos out. The man was a fugitive fleeing the U.S. Marshals. With the man holed up inside Carlos’ shop, the Marshals and the LAPD initiated a standoff. The LAPD SWAT team fired more than 30 rounds of tear gas into the business, blasting holes through doors, windows and walls in the process. Two days later, when the smoke cleared and Carlos was allowed back into his shop, the damage was overwhelming. In addition to the holes that had been blasted in the building, the chemicals from the tear gas soiled most of his merchandise and left his printers non-functioning. All-in-all, Carlos estimates the raid caused more than $60,000 in damage, put him completely out of business until January 2023, and left him operating on a drastically smaller scale when he finally did reopen out of his own personal garage. When Carlos called his insurance company, he learned that, like many policies, his did not cover “acts of government.” Carlos then reached out to both the U.S. Marshals and the city of Los Angeles about receiving compensation. The Marshals told him they were not liable because the LAPD SWAT team was the group responsible for the destruction. Meanwhile, the city argued it was immune from compensating Carlos because its SWAT team was executing “police powers.” Pursuing a fugitive is certainly a public service, and sometimes when the government performs public services it may have to “take” or destroy private property in the process. But when that does happen, the government cannot leave the innocent, unlucky property owners holding the bill. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the government to provide “just compensation” when it takes private property for a public purpose.The good news for Carlos is that at least one other court has acknowledged the simple truth that the government must compensate victims when SWAT teams destroy their private property. In June 2022, a federal jury ruled that the city of McKinney, Texas must pay an innocent woman nearly $60,000 after a SWAT team destroyed her home pursuing a fugitive who broke into the home to hide from police. 

 The Fifth Amendment applies to all government agents, whether they have the “police powers” or not. Simply put, government agents should be held to the same standard we’re all held to when we go to a pottery shop: “you break it, you buy it.” Jeffrey Redfern is an attorney at the Institute for Justice and represents Carlos Pena in his lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. Related Articles
