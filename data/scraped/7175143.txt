The Seattle Sea Dragons’ reign of terror over the XFL has come to an end. On Sunday night, Seattle narrowly lost to the first place DC Defenders at Lumen Field by a score of 34-33. It was a game the Sea Dragons desperately needed to win. Alas, no cigar. Seattle fought valiantly after their 16-6 halftime deficit, but could not overcome the Defenders. On the Sea Dragons’ final possession, they did score a touchdown. Unfortunately, the ensuing two-point conversion was unsuccessful, as was the 4th-and-15 “onside” conversion attempt to gain one final possession. The Seattle defense that was so stout the week prior struggled to contain DC, and allowed two touchdown drives in the 4th quarter alone. Sunday was a costly defeat for the Sea Dragons, especially since the St. Louis Battlehawks won this weekend as well. Now the Battlehawks are a full game and a half ahead of Seattle. The Sea Dragons head to the Gateway to the West next week for a rematch with the Battlehawks. A win is required if they want to keep their slim playoff hopes alive.
