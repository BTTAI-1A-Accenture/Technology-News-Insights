If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Kyle Busch is first among active drivers and fifth all-time with eight NASCAR Cup Series victories at Bristol Motor Speedway, all of which came on a concrete surface. The two-time series champion posted his first win at the track on dirt last year and looks to repeat the feat when he competes in the 2023 Food City Dirt Race on Sunday. Busch recorded his 61st career series victory earlier this season at Fontana, snapping a tie with Kevin Harvick for ninth place on the all-time list. Busch is listed at +1000, while Kyle Larson is the +450 favorite in the latest 2023 Food City Dirt Race odds from Caesars Sportsbook. Tyler Reddick and Christopher Bell are +600, while Chase Briscoe rounds out the top five 2023 Food City Dirt Race contenders at +900. The Food City Dirt Race 2023 is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET. You'll want to check out the NASCAR at Bristol predictions from Micah Roberts, the legendary Vegas bookmaker who pioneered wagering on racing, before locking in any 2023 Food City Dirt Race picks.  Roberts was the first to offer expanded NASCAR betting and now hands out NASCAR winners to his followers on SportsLine. Roberts is the nation's premier NASCAR betting expert, and his top pick, Reddick, won the EchoPark Automotive Grand Prix two weeks ago at +1000 odds. He also correctly predicted Chase Elliott to win the YellaWood 500 at +1200 last October and the Jockey Made in America 250 in 2021, nailed the 2021 Coca-Cola 600 winner by hitting Larson's victory at +550 odds and was on point by targeting Elliott as the winner of the EchoPark Texas Grand Prix at +160 odds the previous week. Anyone who has followed his picks has cashed ticket after ticket. Now, Roberts has analyzed the field and odds for Sunday's NASCAR at Bristol 2023 race. He's sharing his winner and projected 2023 Toyota Owners 400 leaderboard right here. One shocker: Roberts is fading Larson, even though he is the favorite at +450. In fact, Roberts says Larson, who finished fourth in this race last year and is coming off his first victory of the season, barely even cracks the top 10. "For fun, he likes to go racing on dirt. And he wins on a bunch of those dirt tracks," Roberts told SportsLine. "But stuff happens crazier and quicker on dirt. ... I think he's overpriced." See who else to fade here. Another curveball: Roberts is high on Martin Truex Jr., who is listed at +2000 in the latest Food City Dirt Race odds. The 2017 NASCAR Cup Series champion is looking to snap a 51-race drought as his last victory came in September 2021 at Richmond. Truex failed to finish in the top 15 in the first two Cup Series dirt races at Bristol but led 105 laps and won the Truck Series dirt-track event there two years ago.  "Truex has finished 19th and 21st on the dirt at Bristol, but he was much better than those results indicate," Roberts said. "In 2021, he led 126 laps and then got a flat late in the race." See who else to back here. Roberts is high on a huge longshot who doesn't have much experience on dirt tracks but has raced on them "like he's been doing it his entire career." This driver is being underestimated by oddsmakers, and anyone who backs him could hit it big. You can only see who it is here. So who wins the 2023 Food City Dirt Race?
