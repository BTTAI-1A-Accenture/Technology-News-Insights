Firefighters in Braintree, Massachusetts, battled a multi-alarm fire Thursday night at a facility near the Weymouth Fore River and the Quincy town line. First responders were called to the area of 1 Hill Avenue, home to Clean Harbors, a company that provides environmental and industrial services.  Video from the scene showed flames had spread to multiple tractor-trailers which were parked at the facility.  "Preliminary indications are that the materials in one of the trailers self-reacted," Clean Harbors spokesperson Jim Buckley said. "The trailers contained a mixture of paints, epoxy, oil filters, solvents and similar waste materials." There were no immediate reports of injuries.  "We are asking residents in the area to stay in their homes and keep the windows closed," a message posted to the Braintree town's website said. "The Braintree Fire Department, hazmat teams and other public safety agencies are on scene and actively addressing the situation." Two hours later, officials said that the immediate threat was resolved. Hazmat teams and officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Environmental Protection responded to the scene. According to its website, Clean Harbors handles waste management, emergency spill response, industrial cleaning and maintenance and recycling services. "Water used in the fire response was contained on-site and will be removed over the course of the weekend," Buckley wrote. "Out of an abundance of caution, the company deployed containment equipment in the adjacent waterway although there is no indication of water contamination at this time."
