13 Apr 2023  Image: Techstars Founders of 12 promising start-ups building the future of Web3 will now embark on mentorship with Techstars for three months. Techstars has unveiled its latest Web3 accelerator cohort of start-ups that kicked off week one in Dublin and are now gearing up to create the “next wave of growth in the decentralised internet”. The class of 2023 includes 12 global start-ups selected from a pool of nearly 750 applicants. The founders will now receive training, mentorship and the opportunity to network with potential customers and investors over the next three months. While the programme is largely remote, the programme’s first week kicked off in-person in Dublin last week. “After a four-hour hike in Glendalough, we ran a full week of programming from the Digital Hub, which was a super space for the needs of the accelerator and to initiate relationships across the class,” Hugh McGirr, investment principal at Techstars, told SiliconRepublic.com. Week seven will be run from London in mid-May and the programme will close after investor-founder events in Toronto and New York at the end of June. “After months of preparation, interviews, data crunching and due diligence, we finally kicked off the Techstars Web3 accelerator class of 2023,” said Techstars managing director Pete Townsend, who is an ambassador for Huckletree’s Web3 co-working hub in London launched in December. “Our decision to go find 12 fantastic founding teams building in the midst of crypto winter has been totally validated.” Here are the 12 start-ups accelerating with Techstars to build the future of Web3.
