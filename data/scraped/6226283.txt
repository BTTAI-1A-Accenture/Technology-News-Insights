CMH partnered with Engage Consultancy and RDC to create the new identity that reflects its connection to the Tahltan Territory. With the changes, the brand will feature Tahltan names for each of CMH’s three facilities and include renowned Victoria-born, Vancouver-based artist and entreprenuer Alano Edzerza’s artwork, which was created for CMH in 2015. CMH General Manager Matt Weber says the new brand identity relates heavily to its location in Tahltan Territory. Weber noted his feelings about the new visual identity in a news release.

And our distinctive new logo was inspired by a detail from one of them, in combination with an abstract water form and a turbine.” Edzerza added that he was “pleased that my artwork has stood the test of time and continues to inspire.” Weber noted that the “Tahltan names given to each of our three projects will now be displayed more prominently in our communications and signage.”  viktor.elias@terracestandard.comLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
