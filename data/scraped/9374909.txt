 Information Technology Services Information Technology Services works to connect Bethel to the world, facilitating teaching and learning and helping our community utilize technology. We work in a variety of areas, from assisting customers at the Help Desk to maintaining our website and supporting applications that Bethel uses everyday.  Information Technology Services improves how Bethel uses technology by collaborating with you. We want to increase the satisfaction of faculty, staff, students, and friends of Bethel as they experience our university through technology. We want to help the university innovate efficient operations and enrich teaching and learning opportunities. ITS is led by Michael Spande, Associate Vice President.
