After an Athens Clarke-County police officer placed handcuffs on Georgia wide receiver Marcus Rosemy-Jacksaint for driving 90 miles per hour in a 45 MPH zone on May 23, he asked him if he was an athlete. “Yes sir,” he said. “What do you play?” asked the officer who pulled Rosemy-Jacksaint over in front of the McAlister’s Deli on West Broad Street in a 2020 Dodge Charger.
