Intelligent CIO Europe Providing Unparalleled Technology Intelligence  Proximus, a Belgian public company listed on the Brussels stock exchange, and Google Cloud have announced a five-year agreement to deliver sovereign cloud services in Belgium and Luxembourg. This partnership will help securely deploy sensitive, mission-critical workloads and provide next-generation digital sovereignty controls for governments, regulated enterprises and international organisations. Under this agreement, sovereign cloud services will support disconnected operations through Google Distributed Cloud Hosted, which does not require connectivity to Google Cloud to manage infrastructure, services, APIs or tooling. Google Cloud’s sovereign solutions are designed to support data, operational and software sovereignty requirements, increasing customer control and transparency for sensitive data moving to the cloud. “Data sovereignty is vital to European and international organisations as they digitise their operations and deploy the latest cloud innovations,” said Adaire Fox-Martin, President of Google Cloud Go to Market & Head of Google Ireland. “These sovereign cloud solutions will help ensure that public and private-sector organisations can advance their Digital Transformation agendas using the latest technologies – without compromising on the security and sovereignty of their data and systems.” Proximus plans to work with LuxConnect – a data centre service provider owned by the Luxembourg state – to bring these sovereign solutions to life in Belgium and Luxembourg.
