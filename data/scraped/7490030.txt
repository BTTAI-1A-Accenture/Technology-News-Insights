Android Headlines / Best Cell Phone Deals / Best Cheap Home Internet Deals for July 2024 Are you in search of affordable home internet for your new place, or do you want to switch to a cheaper provider? Look no further! We have got you covered with the best home internet deals that won’t break the bank. Home internet is one of the most essential monthly expenses as it gives us access to virtually everything. With more people working from home than ever before, having a reliable internet connection has become a necessity. Therefore, it’s crucial to get an excellent deal from your ISP or another provider available in your area. However, it’s important to note that not all ISPs are available in every area. Usually, you will be limited to two or three options, and in some places, only one provider is available. This is mostly true for rural areas. But in larger cities, you’ll likely have at least two of the following providers: Comcast, AT&T, Cox, and Verizon Fios. We’re a bit impartial to Verizon Fios, as it does offer some pretty incredible prices for its gigabit plan. Just $65 per month for gigabit speeds, and with Verizon Fios, that’s gigabit up and down. And Verizon also includes the Disney+ bundle for some plans not to mention the fact that you can get your equipment for free if you sign up. AT&T is also pretty decent but doesn’t have as many perks. It offers gigabit fiber, and it ranges from $60-$90 depending on your area. However, one perk it does offer is free HBO MAX for the life of your account. Which is a nice perk to have. As that will save you $15 per month. Comcast is available almost everywhere, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find some great perks for Comcast. It does offer up Peacock Premium for free, but only if you also add TV. However, their plans are as low as $20, depending on your area. So if you need cheap internet, it’s a great option. Cox and Wow aren’t quite as popular and don’t cover as much area as AT&T and Comcast, but they are available in some cities. Without further ado, here are the Best Cheap Home Internet Deals that are currently available. T-Mobile offers 5G Home Internet in many cities across the country for just $50 with auto-pay, or $55 without auto-pay. Like T-Mobile, Verizon also offers 5G Home Internet based on its 5G network. It is also available across much of the country. You will still want to check their site for availability. It’s as low as $35/month if you’re not a Verizon customer, there is also a $45/month plan that will get you faster speeds. Depending on your wireless plan, you could get this for $25 per month. AT&T has fiber starting as low as $35 per month for Internet 300. And it goes up to $90 for Internet 1000. This also includes autopay and your modem is free for the first year ($10/month after). And there’s no price increase after 12 months, unlike some other internet providers. It’s essential to check Verizon Fios’ coverage first, as they are only available in a handful of states. But their fiber does start at $25 per month for 300Mbps. Or you can get 500Mbps for $45 and Gigabit for $65 per month. There are different perks with each offer. There are a lot more options for Cox, starting at $50 per month for 100Mbps and going up to $109 for gigabit service. So there should be something available for everyone’s budget here. You can also bundle Cox Internet with TV and get 140+ channels with 150Mbps speeds for about $90 per month. Like Cox, Comcast also has a number of different plans that are available for you to choose from. You can get 100Mbps for around $40 per month. That’s going to be great for most people. Though if you need more, you can get gigabit for around $90 per month. Keep in mind that most plans do not include the price of the modem rental, which can be $10-$15 per month depending on the area. Wow is probably one of the more interesting ISPs out there right now. It offers some really cheap plans, but it is not available in most areas. So, definitely check coverage before you choose this ISP. But you can get 300Mbps for just $30 per month. Or go up to a Gigabit for $60 per month. There are plans in between those speeds too. WOW also promises that the price won’t go up, and there’s no data caps. Copyright ©2024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
