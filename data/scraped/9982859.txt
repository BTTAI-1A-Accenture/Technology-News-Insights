L&L Products, a global provider of industrial solutions and finished goods for the automotive industry, is expanding in the village of Romeo with supportâ¯from the Michigan Strategic Fund. The project, which includes expansive warehousing facilities and room to accommodate two-shot injection molding production processes, is expected to generate a total capital investment of approximately $25 million and create 65 advanced manufacturing jobs. The private investment is supported by a $450,000 Michigan Business Development Program performance-based grant. Michigan was chosen for the project over a competing site in South Carolina. L&L Products Inc. is a family-owned, technology-driven, B2B company with expertise in static sealing, acoustics, vibration reduction, structural reinforcements, and composite components for automotive, aerospace, commercial vehicle, and other industrial applications. The company was founded in the village of Almont (north of Romeo) in 1958. Today, L&L has more than 1,300 employees worldwide (525 in Michigan), locations in 16 countries, and nine manufacturing facilities. âWeâre really proud of L&Lâs 65-year history in Michigan,â says Tom Kleino, president of L&L Products Americas. âIt made sense to continue expanding our Romeo campus, and we look forward to providing jobs and supporting the local community with this investment.â The company has established the L&L Foundations, which provide educational scholarship to as many applicants as possible to help support the cost of attending a college, university, technical, trade, or vocational school. âThe planned expansion in Romeo will ensure that L&Lâ¯remains a major economic driver in the north end of the county,â says Mark Hackel, Macomb County executive. âThey have been a model citizen partner helping support our community in so many ways.â¯We want to thank the entire team at L&L, and look forwardâ¯to continuing our partnerships.â The village of Romeo plans to approve a 50 percent property tax abatement in support of the project. âThe timing for this news couldnât be better for the village of Romeo,â says Meagan Poznanski, president of the village of Romeo. âL&L Productsâ decision to expand their business here not only provides employment opportunities for our community, but maintains their businessâ contribution to the growth and stability of Romeoâs industrial corridor.â For information about careers with L&L, visit here.
