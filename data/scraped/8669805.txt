Natasha Sheybani, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Virginia School of Engineering, will collaborate with researchers at Children's National Hospital to study the combination of two therapies for pediatric brain cancer. Proteins left behind by COVID-19 long after initial infection can cause cortisol levels in the brain to plummet, inflame the nervous system and prime its immune cells to hyper-react when another stressor arises, according to new animal research by University of Colorado Boulder scientists. The saga of cancer treatment is marked by a relentless pursuit of effectiveness against a disease characterized by complexity and adaptability. Lexogen, a leader in RNA sequencing technologies, is thrilled to announce the launch of the RiboCop rRNA Depletion Kit for Fish, a dedicated solution to facilitate transcriptome analysis of fish species by effectively removing unwanted ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from total RNA samples. Studying cell migration is vital because it plays a crucial role in many biological processes, including immune response, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. Weill Cornell Medicine has received a five-year, $12.4 million grant from the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, for an extensive program of basic and translational research on the biology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of lymphoma. Within each of us lies an army of cells whose topmost duty is protecting against external pathogens and internal threats such as proliferating cancer cells. Study demonstrates that a novel prime/boost vaccination protocol using live-attenuated influenza vaccines effectively induces strong immune responses in pigs, offering a promising approach for future influenza vaccination strategies. Nanoparticles delivered intravenously in mice can block the allergic reactions to red meat caused by the bite of the lone star tick, new research led by the University of Michigan shows. Two studies published in the latest issue of the journal Cell by University of Pittsburgh researchers uncover how immunotherapies targeting the immune checkpoints PD1 and LAG3 work together to activate immune responses. Respiratory infections can be severe, even deadly, in some individuals, but not in others. A new study from scientists at Cincinnati Children's suggests there may be a way to further protect transplanted hearts from rejection by preparing the donor organ and the recipient with an anti-inflammatory antibody treatment before surgery occurs. Study developed a proteomic age clock using plasma proteins to accurately predict biological age and associated health risks, offering a robust tool for forecasting age-related diseases and mortality. A new study has revealed important information about how a patient's testosterone level can help protect them from severe Covid-19. People with celiac disease must navigate everyday life by avoiding gluten, a protein in wheat, rye and barley which can trigger painful symptoms in the gut, impede the absorption of nutrients and raise the risk of other serious long-term issues. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of cancer, primarily because it is usually diagnosed very late. When a person experiences an injury or infection, the body's immune system responds with inflammation to start the healing process. However, inflammation can occur in much less helpful circumstances – for example, when a person experiences psychological stress or consistently eats a poor diet high in sugars, fats, and processed foods. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted our lives, claiming nearly 7.1 million lives globally. Scientists and medical professionals have been working tirelessly to understand the virus, its transmission pathways, and effective treatments. The urgency of developing vaccines and treatments has never been greater, prompting calls for Korea to expedite its drug development efforts to match those of developed countries. Recently, a team of Korean researchers has made a breakthrough that will greatly enhance the efficiency of respiratory disease research, garnering attention. Tumor immunotherapy leverages the body's immune system to target and eradicate cancer cells, offering a crucial treatment for patients unresponsive to surgery or conventional therapies. Despite its potential, the effectiveness of immunotherapy is often hindered by T cell exhaustion within the tumor microenvironment, leading to diminished immune response and tumor progression. Based on these challenges, exploring the role of progenitor exhausted T cells (Tpex) in overcoming immune resistance is essential for advancing immunotherapeutic strategies and improving clinical outcomes. An activity pattern in certain genes responsible for building proteins known as spleen tyrosine kinases can predict which melanoma patients are likely to have severe side effects from immunotherapy designed to treat the most deadly skin cancer, a new study shows. John Yates In this interview conducted at Pittcon 2024, we spoke to Professor John Yates about capturing cardiomyocyte cell-to-cell heterogeneity via shotgun top-down proteomics. Tim Simpson Hologic’s Tim Simpson Discusses the Future of Cervical Cancer Screening. Maria Marco In this interview conducted at Pittcon 2024 in San Diego, Maria Marco discusses her research on the health benefits, safety, and waste reduction potential of fermented foods, and the microbial processes involved in their production.
