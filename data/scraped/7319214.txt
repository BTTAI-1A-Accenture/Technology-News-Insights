                 PETALING JAYA: Malaysia's 5G adoption rate is among the fastest in the world with 70.2% coverage and 5,873 sites available nationwide as of Sept 30, says Fahmi Fadzil. The Communications and Digital Minister was replying to Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani's (BN-Titiwangsa) question about the status of 5G network development. "Digital Nasional Bhd (DNB), the sole provider of the 5G network, aims to build (another 1,636 sites next year for) a total of 7,509 5G sites and 80% coverage nationwide," he said during the question-and-answer session in the Dewan Rakyat on Monday (Oct 9). When asked about the number of subscriptions received through 5G network services, Fahmi said a total of 2.49 million have been recorded with a penetration rate of 7.4%. "Six mobile service providers have offered 5G commercial plans including CelcomDigi, Maxis, Umobile, Telekom Malaysia, YTL Communications and Yodoo," he added. Fahmi also said PETRONAS launched a private 5G network to optimise its internal operations last Thursday (Oct 5), the first of its kind in Malaysia. "This ensures 5G services are maximised by companies and net sustainability and balance is achieved," he said. COMP
