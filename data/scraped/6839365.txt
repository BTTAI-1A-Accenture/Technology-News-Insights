A Birch Tree man died Friday when he fell into the Current River near Eminence. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said Jason Bollinger, 48, of Birch Tree, was in a 10-foot kayak Friday afternoon at Martin Hole, 10 miles east of Eminence. The patrol said as Bollinger traveled downstream, he fell into the water and failed to resurface. Bollinger was not wearing a lifejacket, the patrol said. Bollinger reportedly fell into the water just after 4 p.m. Friday and was later pronounced dead at the scene.
