Mythical Games pioneers mobile gaming in the Web3 era with the launch of Blankos Block Party, following the stellar success of NFL Rivals.  Mythical Games is going all in with mobile gaming by launching yet another of its web3 games on mobile devices. It is indeed a smart move to make a mobile version of its Web3 PC game Blankos Block Party. This decision comes after the company had a lot of success with its NFL Rivals game for iOS and Android. The game had a superb opening as it hit a massive download number of more than 2.5 million. The timing was crucial as NFL Rivals game came out in August when the NFL season started. It was the first Web3 game to be sold in app stores, so it made history. In an interview with GamesBeat, John Linden, the CEO of Mythical Games, said that NFL Rivals had features from both Web2 and Web3. The fact that the game didn't need cryptocurrencies or Mythical's own tokens for in-app purchases meant that it didn't have to deal with any restrictions. Mythical Games followed the rules set by Google Play and the Apple App Store. However, it still has a prominent spot in the two app stores that gamers use the most. Along with other restrictions, Google Play has strict rules that say Web3 games can't have anything to do with gambling. Apple, on the other hand, seemed to approve of the game as an experiment. They even made NFL Rivals the "game of the day," which CEO John Linden said was a big deal for the company. Mythical Games had a lot of conversations with app stores to figure out its strategy. Even though Web3 technology is built into the NFL Rivals game, the company's main goal is still to provide a "gamers-first" experience so that players can enjoy NFL Rivals without having to learn about how blockchain technology works. It's important to know that NFL Rivals can only be played on iOS and Android devices. NFL Rivals gives players the chance to get digital collectibles, improve them, and trade them with other players. On Mythical's Marketplace, you can trade and sell these digital collectibles, but you don't have to do either of these things. The blockchain marketplace is easy to get to from within the mobile game, which makes it easier for users. Items in the Market are priced in Rivals credits, and players can buy these items from app stores using virtual currency. You can also buy things on the blockchain with this virtual money. But it's important to know that credits bought inside the game can't be cashed out. Instead, they can be used to buy things inside the game. Also, players can get this in-game currency by making purchases within the app. When this happens, app stores take a 30% cut of these purchases. This step was probably very important for getting in line with the rules of both the App Store and the Google Play Store. In the background, players are given wallets to keep track of their tokens. However, it's important to remember that the Mythical token can't be traded for other cryptocurrencies. John Linden, the CEO of Mythical Games, said that he was happy with the positive feedback from the industry, which shows that they are becoming more popular. He said that they have moved on from showing that their plan could work to talking with people in the industry about the release of new games. Linden says that their strategy is working out pretty well. In terms of how they've worked with Apple and Google Play, Linden said that Apple has been less open than Google Play, but they've still talked to both of them regularly. Linden didn't know if Apple had an official policy on blockchain games at the time, but he did say that Apple closely watched some parts of Web3 but didn't worry about other parts. Mythical Games worked hard to follow the rules of the app store, and they can see everything the studio builds. Notably, Mythical Games put out a program that uses machine learning to improve a player's lineup. When this feature was added to the game, the number of second-hand sales from one player to another player increased by about four times. John Linden, the CEO of Mythical Games, brought up a key point in their talks with Apple: "50% of all players who bought something early from another player have come back to buy things in-app." This number shows Apple that the way they do things is not bad for the platform. In Blankos, players buy collectibles from each other and then go back to the in-app store to buy more. In this Web3 game, players spent more money than they usually do in free-to-play games, which was an interesting thing to notice. Linden was optimistic about the future of Web3 gaming. He said, "I think Web3 is getting close to a turning point." We are on track to add about a million new players to the game every month, which is a very good sign. Blankos Block Party, on the other hand, is only available for PC and Mac right now. But Mythical Games is currently making changes to the game based on what they've learned so far, and they plan to release it on mobile. Linden said that their plan is to make a new game that is designed for mobile first and will also work with PCs. Blankos Block Party ran into a problem where spending in-game was less than the cost of getting new players, and this cost was especially high because the game wasn't in app stores. Even though it was available on the Epic Games Store, it was Mythical Games' job to promote it, which cost a lot of money. Also, there were two different things to do in the game: shooting and racing. Their audiences didn't overlap much. By making these changes, the company hopes to do well in mobile app stores. Overall, Linden was happy with how their projects were going so far, which showed how optimistic the company was about the future. Mythical Games is a pioneering game development studio known for its foray into the emerging Web3 era of gaming. Their latest endeavor involves launching a mobile version of their Web3 PC game, Blankos Block Party, following the success of NFL Rivals. NFL Rivals is a notable mobile game developed by Mythical Games. It gained substantial popularity, boasting over 2.5 million downloads. This success can be attributed in part to its strategic release timing, coinciding with the start of the NFL season. It was particularly groundbreaking as it became the first Web3 game to be available in app stores. Web3 gaming represents a new era where blockchain technology and decentralized networks play a central role in gaming experiences. It differs from Web2 gaming by incorporating blockchain elements, enabling players to own, trade, and sell in-game assets with real-world value, often involving cryptocurrencies. John Linden is the CEO of Mythical Games. He plays a pivotal role in the company's strategic decision-making and oversees the development and deployment of their Web3 gaming titles. NFL Rivals successfully integrated elements from both Web2 and Web3 gaming. Notably, it did not require the use of cryptocurrencies or Mythical Games' proprietary tokens for in-app purchases, thereby avoiding certain restrictions and appealing to a broader player base. Yes, there were challenges. While Google Play enforced strict rules prohibiting Web3 games associated with gambling, Apple took a more experimental approach. NFL Rivals was even featured as the "game of the day" by Apple, signifying its approval for a Web3 experiment. However, Mythical Games engaged in extensive discussions with app stores to ensure compliance while maintaining a "gamers-first" experience. Mythical Games' adherence to app store rules is crucial for its games' accessibility and success. It allows the company to secure prominent positions in app stores, enabling more players to discover and download their Web3 games. Players can acquire Rivals credits through in-game purchases, primarily using virtual currency. While these credits cannot be converted into real money, they facilitate transactions within the game, making it easier for players to enhance their gaming experience. Mythical Games' CEO, John Linden, is optimistic about the future of Web3 gaming. He believes that Web3 is approaching a turning point and anticipates adding approximately one million new players to their games every month, signaling a promising future for the Web3 gaming industry. Currently available only for PC and Mac, Blankos Block Party is undergoing modifications based on lessons learned. Mythical Games plans to release a mobile version of the game, designed to cater to both mobile and PC users, in an effort to address player spending issues and enhance promotion. One of the challenges Blankos Block Party encountered was the cost of acquiring new players, which was relatively high, especially since the game was not available in app stores. Additionally, the game had two distinct gameplay elements—shooting and racing—with limited audience overlap. Mythical Games aims to address these issues in the mobile version. Mythical Games has implemented machine learning to improve player lineups. This feature significantly increased secondary sales between players, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating advanced technology in enhancing the gaming experience. No, Mythical Tokens cannot be traded for other cryptocurrencies. They are exclusive to Mythical Games' ecosystem and serve a specific purpose within the company's games. Mythical Games intends to continue exploring the potential of Web3 gaming, with a focus on creating innovative and engaging experiences that bridge the gap between blockchain technology and mainstream gaming. Their commitment to providing "gamers-first" experiences remains a central aspect of their vision for the future.
