Amazon Prime Day 2024 may be your best chance to browse and buy the retailer's range of Fire TVs, including the Fire TV Omni QLED, 4-Series and 2-Series. While Amazon's popular Fire TV Sticks and Cubes are perfect for upgrading old TVs to "smart" TVs – allowing consumers to stream content from the likes of Netflix, Prime Video and Disney+ – the company has taken things a step further with its own integrated TVs.  The Fire TVs in Amazon's own-brand range have the company's operating system built in, so there's no need to plug in an external streaming device. If you're interested in the Amazon Fire TV range and want to learn more, then you've come to the right place because here's everything you need to know about the available sets – plus more details on the latest Fire TV deals for Prime Day, a two-day sale event run by Amazon on July 16 and 17 this year. Our most recent Amazon Fire TV price check was completed on Wednesday, July 17 at 1.30pm UK time.  Amazon brought three models from the Fire TV Omni range to the UK: the flagship Fire TV Omni QLED, the mid-range Fire TV 4-Series and the budget Fire TV 2-Series. The 65" Fire TV Omni QLED, all 4-Series and both 2-Series sets started shipping in mid-April 2023, with more sizes of the Omni QLED arriving in June. Sitting at the top of Amazon's television range is its flagship Fire TV Omni QLED. This is available in four screen sizes: 43", 50", 55" and 65". Usually, prices range from £549.99 for the 43" model to £999.99 for the 65" model. Some of the TVs are currently on offer for Prime Day, so we might not see them rediscounted until the next Black Friday.  The 65" may not have altered its price this Prime Day, but fret not as all the other Omni QLED screens are available for less.  The 55" Omni QLED series 4K has seen its usual price of £749.99 slashed to £429.99, while the 50" is down to £379.99 from its RPP of 649.99. Good news if you had your eyes on the smallest in the range too, as the 43" Omni QLED has applied a 45% discount to its normal price and is available to buy for £299.99 instead of £549.99. • Amazon Fire TV 65" Omni QLED series 4K UHD smart TV: £999.99 • Amazon Fire TV 55" Omni QLED series 4K UHD smart TV: RRP £799.99, now £429.99 • Amazon Fire TV 50" Omni QLED series 4K UHD smart TV: RRP £649.99, now £379.99 • Amazon Fire TV 43" Omni QLED series 4K UHD smart TV: RRP £549.99, now £299.99 Amazon is clearly targeting living rooms with the Fire TV Omni QLED. It's available in four large screen-size options and the range boasts an impressive range of features – including a 4K Quantum Dot display, with advanced HDR thanks to Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10+ tech.

The TV is bundled with a Fire TV Alexa voice remote, which can also be purchased as a standalone item. The Omni QLED has a hands-free Alexa experience that works just like an Echo or Echo Dot, allowing you to easily find, launch and control your content or check the weather, sports and more. Additionally, these sets have a feature called Adaptive Brightness, which Amazon says "automatically optimises the brightness of films and TV programmes through a built-in sensor that detects the lighting in your room".  The Ambient Experience feature basically turns the TV set into a smart display for personal photos, Alexa widgets and more, when you're not watching programming. It's similar to Samsung's popular range of Frame televisions.  The Omni QLED Series uses its built-in presence sensors to detect when a person enters the room and switches to the Ambient Experience.  There is a note on the product listing page that advises "movement from pets, fans and other objects can turn on the TV and resume the Ambient Experience". The presence sensor settings can, of course, be tweaked if your cat or dog decides it wants to watch TV on a regular basis. The Omni QLED TV sets also come with Amazon's 30-day device return policy and a year's limited warranty. Sitting under the Omni QLED is the Fire TV 4-Series, available in three sizes (43", 50" and 55"). The Fire TV 4-Series is usually priced from £429.99 for the 43" model to £549.99 for the 55" model. However, all these TVs have also made their way into Amazon's Prime Day deals and are available with discounts of 40% or more for Prime members: • Amazon Fire TV 55", 4-series 4K UHD smart TV: RRP £549.99, now £329.99 • Amazon Fire TV 50", 4-series 4K UHD smart TV: RRP £499.99, now £299.99 • Amazon Fire TV 43", 4-series 4K UHD smart TV: RRP £429.99, now £249.99 The Fire TV 4-Series lineup combines 4K UHD resolution with HDR10 and HLG, for cinematic picture quality. It doesn't include the Ambient Experience featured on the Omni QLED, and Alexa is accessed through the Voice Remote (rather than being hands-free). The 4-Series sets have three HDMI inputs. Like the Omni QLED range, the 4-Series TVs have a year's limited warranty and the usual 30-day Amazon Device returns policy. At the cheapest end of the scale is the Fire TV 2-Series. This is available in 32" and 40" versions and is usually priced at £249.99 (for the 32" model) and £299.99 (for the 40" model).  For Prime Day, the 32" and 40" models have gone down by 44% and 40% respectively and are currently priced at £139.99 and £179.99 – the lowest price to date for either set. The Fire TV 2-Series 32" has a 720p HD resolution, while the Fire TV 2-Series 40" features full 1080p HD resolution.  Despite being the cheapest models, both 2-Series models include support for HDR 10, HLG and Dolby Digital Audio. You also get the Alexa Voice Remote, and both models have two HDMI inputs. Like Amazon's other own-brand TVs, the Fire TV 2-Series items come with a 30-day Amazon Device returns policy and a year's limited warranty.
