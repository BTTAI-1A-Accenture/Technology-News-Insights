 OKW celebrates 50 years of its Flat-Pack Case range, perfect for an expansive range of desktop and wall-mount electronics. Applications comprise medical and wellness, measurement and control, laboratory equipment and computer peripherals. Over the last half-century, the case has become the enclosure for thousands of devices. These robust housings owe their continuing popularity to the discreet, understated design – and the rugged tongue-and-groove construction, which offers basic protection against dust and water ingress, even without a seal. Development of case began at the end of the 1960s when CEO Dieter Schneider teamed up with the firm’s toolmaking, production and sales manager Erich Ettinger planning to produce a standard plastic housing that would suit an expansive range of electronics applications. Design work continued into the 1970s, and in 1975, and the case won two iF Design Awards in Hanover. Design features incorporate concealed fixing screws and the U-shaped top, which is straightforward to remove – exposing open sides that provide greater access to the electronics for inspection and maintenance. Three different tops are offered: N (low), H (high) and A (which has an optional aluminium front panel and a raised edge to protect the operating elements). It is offered in 13 sizes, from 100mm x 50mm x 25mm to 210mm x 125mm x 70mm. Two sizes provide a tilt swivel carry handle that doubles as a desk stand. All have screw pillars inside for mounting PCBs. The enclosures are moulded from ABS (UL 94 HB). The standard colour combination is an off-white (RAL 9002) top with a pebble grey (RAL 7032) bottom section. Accessories include aluminium front panels, wall suspension elements, assembly kits for wall mounting, tilt foot bars, a belt/pocket clip, snap-locks, anti-slide feet, and self-tapping screws. The company can supply the case fully customised. Services include machining, lacquering, printing legends and logos, laser marking, decor foils, special materials, and installation/assembly of accessories.
