 We picked OnDeck for its variety of business lending products and same-day funding. OnDeck offers a term loan from $5,000 to $250,000 with repayments terms of up to 24 months. You can also access a credit limit of $6,000 to $100,000 through its line of credit with a 12-month repayment term that resets after each withdrawal. Eligibility Turnaround time  You can apply and receive a decision from OnDeck on the same day. Expert’s Take OnDeck has carved a niche in the realm of alternative lending, offering expedited access to capital for businesses that may not qualify for traditional bank loans. Its big advantage is the availability of funds on the same day or next while not being affected by a hard credit pull. However, this aggressive lending practice also comes at a steep price. — Abid Salahi, co-founder and CTO, FinlyWealth Best for a Lender Comparison Site Lendio provides the best online business loan marketplace that helps business owners compare options from 75+ bank and non-bank lenders.

 American Express Business Blueprint™ is best for its American Express® Business Line of Credit (formerly Kabbage from American Express and Kabbage Funding™), which gives business owners the chance to secure funding between $2,000 to $250,000. Repayment terms include six, 12, 18 and 24 months with monthly fees of 3% to 9% for six-month loans, 6% to 18% for 12-month loans, 9% to 27% for 18-month loans and 12% to 18% for 24-month loans. Line of credit customers incur a loan fee for each month they have an outstanding balance. Total monthly fees incurred over the loan term range from 3% to 9% for six-month loans, 6% to 18% for 12-month loans, 9% to 27% for 18-month loans and 12% to 18% for 24-month loans. In addition to its line of credit, American Express Business Blueprint provides other tools beneficial to small business owners, including its own mobile app that provides comprehensive cash flow insights. All businesses are unique and are subject to approval and review. Eligibility All businesses are unique and are subject to approval and review. The required FICO score may be higher based on your relationship with American Express, credit history and other factors. Turnaround time Once application is approved, funds can take up to three business days to appear in your account, depending on your bank. Expert’s Take The American Express® Business Line of Credit allows you to qualify at a credit score of 660 FICO at the time of application*, so it’s not a great option for any business with a bad credit rating. Rather than a typical revolving line of credit, you must choose [from available terms] with varying fees. Every time you withdraw from your business line of credit, it’s treated as a separate installment loan rather than being added to existing loans. One downside to the American Express® Business Line of Credit is the time it takes to receive your cash. You’ll need to wait for your funds to be deposited within three business days, while other lenders offer same-day options. If you need your cash fast, that delay becomes a problem. — Jonathan Feniak, general counsel and head of finance, LLC Attorney BlueVine’s flexible lines of credit offer customers multiple payment structures. Loan amounts range from $5,000 to $250,000.

Bluevine offers a bank sweep program that will provide FDIC insurance to their clients for up to $3 Million.

 National Funding offers working capital small business loans from $5,000 to $500,000 with terms of four months to two years, paid daily or weekly. Borrowers can use their funds for all working capital needs, including inventory, payroll, marketing, taxes and more. National Funding also offers equipment financing up to $150,000 but applicants must have a minimum personal credit score of 575 to qualify for that financing method. Unlike most business lenders, National Funding offers early payoff discounts. Small business loan customers who repay their total remaining balance in full within the first 100 days of the contract will automatically receive a 7% discount off the total remaining balance. Equipment financing customers who repay the total remaining balance early, at any point during the term, will automatically receive a 6% discount off the total remaining balance. Eligibility Turnaround time Most loans are funded within 24 hours of approval, subject to receipt of required documentation, underwriting guidelines and processing time by your bank. Expert’s Take National Funding offers loans from $5,000 to $500,000, but two years is the maximum length for a large loan. I had a client that got excited by what he thought would be a lending source that could do $500k for five years, but the five-year loan was only offered at $100,000. A local banker made a collateralized loan for the large equipment purchase, and the client took a small short-term loan from National Funding to help with cash flow during a tough spot. — Herman Thompson, Jr., advisory board member Fundbox’s AI-powered platform offers business owners quick approvals and funding as early as the next business day.

Business owners can apply for revolving business lines of credit up to $150,000 with repayment terms of 12 or 24 weeks. Your available credit goes back up as you repay your line of credit. Eligibility Turnaround time With a business line of credit from Fundbox, you can receive your funds as soon as the next business day. Expert’s Take The approval process is quick and Fundbox is available for the credit-challenged business. Credit approvals are usually small, so this [typically] isn’t an option for larger purchases. I had a small business client that had Fundbox integrated with her Stripe dashboard, which made it convenient. — Herman Thompson, Jr., advisory board member Funding Circle offers established businesses affordable loans from $25,000 to $500,000   with no minimum annual revenue requirements.

 Funding Circle has been a direct lender specializing in small business loans since 2010. It has helped 135,000 businesses in 700 industries and lent $20.2 billion globally. We chose Funding Circle because it provides fast, affordable loans with a simple application process and funding in as little as 48 hours. Prospective borrowers have three options: business term loan, line of credit or SBA loan. Funding Circle term loans range from $25,000 to $500,000   with repayment terms from six months to five years. If you choose to apply for a business line of credit, you can access credit lines between $6,000 and $100,000. However, Funding Circle doesn’t specify its line of credit repayment terms. You can also apply for Funding Circle SBA loans, which range from $25,000 to $500,000 with terms up to 10 years. There is one main drawback of Funding Circle: There’s a one-time origination fee on each loan ranging from 3.49% to 6.99% of the approved loan amount. Eligibility Turnaround time Depending on the loan type, you can receive your funds within two days. However, SBA loan funding may take up to two weeks. Expert’s Take Funding Circle provides long-term loans that are essential for businesses planning significant investments in growth or infrastructure. The clear terms and lower interest rates compared to short-term loans make this an excellent choice for businesses with a stable financial outlook and a strategic long-term development plan. — Cache Merrill, founder and CTO, Zibtek Biz2Credit offers term loans up to $500,000, working capital financing up to $2 million and commercial real estate loans up to $6 million.

It only takes a few minutes to apply. Biz2Credit can connect business owners with revenue-based financing Up to $2M+ and term loans up to $1 million. Revenue-based financing payments are flexible based on business performance, with a right to reconcile against actual business receipts while term loans are repaid through weekly, bimonthly or monthly payments over the course of 12 to 36 months. Biz2Credit also offers interest-only CRE loans from Up to $2M+ with terms between 12 and 36 months; payments are due monthly. In the event that Biz2Credit cannot provide a financial product, it may present third-party options to qualified prospective borrowers. However, Biz2Credit confirms that “in the vast majority of cases, [it] will make a financing decision without referral to any external party.” Eligibility Eligibility varies based on the financing option you choose. Term loan Revenue-based financing Turnaround time Biz2Credit does not disclose the turnaround time for its financing options. Expert’s Take Similar to Funding Circle, Biz2Credit emerges as a more balanced alternative and functions as a platform to offer a wide range of loans. Due to the more thorough underwriting process, the qualification requirements are more restrictive than other business lenders and funding may not be as quick. — Abid Salahi, co-founder and CTO, FinlyWealth 
 Consider these tips when comparing working capital loans: A working capital loan is financing a business can use to pay for day-to-day operations. This may include covering payroll, making debt payments, restocking inventory and staying current on rent. Working capital loans are typically offered by traditional banks, credit unions and online lenders. Annual percentage rates (APRs) may be lower than for long-term business loans but can still range anywhere from 3% up to 99%. That said, qualification requirements also may be less stringent than for long-term business loans, especially through online lenders. Overall, working capital loans are ideal for seasonal businesses and other operations that need short-term access to funds. Working capital loans are designed to help businesses pay for payroll, rent and other everyday business expenses. These are typically short-term loans that can help you manage your cash flow. Loans are generally issued as a lump sum and repaid with interest. However, there are other types of working capital loans—like business lines of credit—that you can use to access on an as-needed basis. A working capital loan may be helpful to business owners who are struggling to cover the day-to-day operational costs or need to finance temporary expenses for inventory, payroll or supplies. Keep in mind, however, owners shouldn’t use working capital loans to cover long-term expenses like expanding a business or financing expensive equipment. Some situations where a business owner should consider a working capital loan include when: Working capital loans can help business owners fill gaps in funding, make up for seasonal fluctuations in revenue and cover payroll costs. What’s more, business owners can choose from several types of working capital loans to meet these varied needs, including term loans, lines of credit, SBA loans and invoice factoring. A term loan is a type of financing extended by a bank, online lender or other financial institution that must be repaid over a set period of time—usually anywhere from a few months to 25 years. Loan amounts typically span from $2,000 to $500,000, and interest rates can range from 6% to 99%. Related: Best Small Business Loans Business lines of credit let borrowers draw against a set amount of money on an as-needed basis. Instead of receiving money as a lump sum, a business owner can access the line of credit during the draw period, which usually lasts up to five years. Credit limits generally range from $2,000 to $250,000, and APRs extend anywhere from 10% to 99%. SBA loans are backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration and are intended to help small business owners start, maintain and grow their businesses. There are a number of SBA loan programs intended for different purposes, circumstances and applicant qualifications—each with its own loan amounts, terms and rates. Popular SBA loan programs for working capital include: Invoice factoring is the process of selling a business’ invoices to a third-party invoice factoring company for a fee in exchange for a portion of the outstanding balances—generally around 85% to 95% of the total value. Once the invoices are sold, the factoring company is responsible for collections. The business receives the remainder of the funds minus any fees once the factoring company collects the invoices. Invoice factoring enables small businesses to get cash quickly without qualifying for a traditional loan and wading through a lengthy loan application process. If your business processes a large number of credit card transactions, a merchant cash advance may be a good financing option. With this type of working capital loan, a lender allows you to borrow money against a portion of your future sales.  The lender will charge you a fee, known as a factor rate, that you’ll then pay in addition to the loan amount with credit card transactions. These loans can be expensive, but they have less strict borrowing requirements compared to other financing options and can be funded quickly. The process for getting a working capital loan depends largely on the type of loan and the lender. However, there are a few steps you’re likely to encounter when applying for such a loan. Follow these general steps to get a working capital loan: 1. Evaluate your borrowing needs. If you suspect your business may benefit from a working capital loan, spend some time evaluating how much you need to borrow and for how long. Consider how much you can afford to make in payments each month and whether you need a lump-sum cash infusion or a line of credit you can access on an as-needed basis. 2. Check your business and personal credit scores. If your business has its own credit profile, lenders will evaluate both your business and personal credit scores. Before you apply, check your scores to evaluate your approval odds. It’s necessary to have a personal FICO Score of at least 530 to qualify for a working capital loan. However, a score of 600 or higher will qualify you for better rates and terms. 3. Research and compare lenders. Once you know how much you need to borrow and whether you’re likely to qualify, research lenders with loan amounts and qualification requirements that fit your needs. Compare banks, credit unions and online lenders based on available interest rates, repayment terms and fees. Then, spend some time reading customer reviews to evaluate each lender’s reputation. 4. Gather required documentation. Required documents may vary by lender. However, most financial institutions require business loan applicants to provide information about existing business loans and submit at least 12 months of personal and business bank statements, plus tax returns for a minimum of two years. You also may need to provide a detailed business plan—especially if you own a startup. 5. Submit a formal loan application. When your documentation is ready, submit a formal loan application through the lender’s website or at a branch. Procedures vary, but most lenders contact the prospective borrower via phone or email to request any additional information before processing the application, making a loan offer and sending it to underwriting. Many lenders also let you check your application status online. A working capital loan may not be the best option for you and your business. There are alternative financing options that you can consider.  We reviewed 19 popular lenders based on 16 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the nine best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category: Within each major category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms and applicable fees. We also looked at minimum credit score and time in business requirements and the geographic availability of the lender. Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online applications, prequalification options and mobile apps. Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion.

 ¹The required FICO score may be higher based on your relationship with American Express, credit history, and other factors. Working loans can be a good idea depending on your business and its needs. If you need to finance temporary expenses on a short-term basis, working capital loans can be a good fit for your business, especially if you don’t meet the requirements for traditional, long-term loans. Nonetheless, long-term loans often come with lower interest rates, making them a cheaper option if your business qualifies. It is possible to get a working capital loan with a FICO Score of just 530, but it may prove more difficult than for more creditworthy borrowers. That said, borrowers with bad credit typically have better approval odds through online lenders than traditional banks and credit unions. Business owners with access to valuable collateral also may qualify for financing more easily than those limited to unsecured loans. To qualify for a working capital loan through an online lender, business owners should have a personal credit score of at least 530—though a score of at least 600 is most competitive, especially for traditional banks and lenders. Lenders also look at how long an applicant has been in business, as well as the business’ financial records and business plan. This often means applicants must provide at least 12 months of personal and business bank statements and at least two years of tax returns as part of the application process. Interest rates on working capital loans vary based on the type of financing, the lender and the borrower’s personal and business credit profiles. In general, though, rates can range anywhere from 3% to 99%, depending on the lender, loan terms and applicant qualifications.
