[Mose Sammy, Standard]  The fill rate at Kemsa before Kenya Kwanza took over, according to the CS, ranged between 40 and 50 per cent. "This has gradually increased to 70 per cent and is headed to 100 per cent in the next six months," the CS said. The second pillar, according to the CS, is on human resources for health. "You can have all the equipment and a perfect building, but if you don't have health workers, it doesn't work. We shall also be discussing how best we can have motivated health workers and how we manage them," said the Health CS.






She said the newly inaugurated Health Advisory Council will help revamp human resources in the health sector. Other pillars are digitalisation and Social Health Insurance, which will enable each Kenyan to access quality healthcare without suffering financial loss. The government has pumped Sh141.2 billion into the Ministry of Health, with at least Sh18.4 billion going into UHC. During the conference that has brought together health experts and stakeholders, Gachagua emphasised the importance of community health promoters in boosting healthcare. "I wish to commend the community health promoters who have been engaged for this assignment. You are our heroes. We cannot pay you enough for the splendid work you are already undertaking," Gachagua said, adding; "Once again, we count on your utmost dedication to deliver to Kenyans, the promise of UHC."






The government allocated less than five per cent of its budget to health. However, Gachagua said plans are underway to meet and exceed the minimum target of 15 per cent of the national budget for the health sector as per the Abuja Declaration. The Abuja Declaration sought to secure a commitment of at least 15 per cent of the national budget for the health sector even though this target has proven elusive for many countries. Further, the DP said President Ruto's administration is keen on promoting preventive healthcare at the grassroots, in partnership with counties. He said this will be boosted by the ongoing reforms at the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). Quality healthcare, the Deputy President said, is expensive for most families, with a larger percentage sinking into abject poverty due to failure to raise funds to seek care. Data has revealed that only 26 per cent of Kenyans have some form of health insurance.



  
"When a serious medical condition strikes, poverty is inevitable for most families. Poverty strips off one's dignity. This in turn slows development," he said. Under the proposed Social Health Insurance bill, which will change the National Health Insurance Fund to the Social Health Authority, every Kenyan is expected to contribute to the kitty.
