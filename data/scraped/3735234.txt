If you run a retail, hospitality, or service business, you know how important a point of sale (POS) system is. A POS system is more than just a cash register or a payment terminal. It's a software solution that helps you manage your inventory, sales, customers, employees, and more. But with so many options and features available, how do you choose the best POS software for your needs? In this article, we'll explore some of the key features and functions that POS software users expect and need, and how they can improve your POS software usability.
 
One of the most essential features of a POS software is inventory management. This allows you to track your stock levels, costs, and margins in real time, and automate your ordering and replenishment processes. A good inventory management feature should also let you create and manage product variants, bundles, and modifiers, as well as generate reports and alerts on your inventory performance. With a robust inventory management feature, you can optimize your inventory turnover, reduce waste and shrinkage, and increase your profits.

            POS systems streamline business operations by:

- Processing sales (adding items, discounts, taxes)
- Tracking inventory (levels, alerts, reorders)
- Managing customers (data, history, loyalty)
- Accepting various payments (cash, cards, wallets)
- Generating reports (sales, inventory, customers)
- Managing employees (accounts, hours, permissions)
- Providing security (data protection, access control)
- Integrating with other software (accounting, marketing)

This helps businesses improve efficiency, gain insights, and make better decisions.

            Inventory management is the foundation of all POS software and this makes this a critical component of any POS (Point of Sale) software system, where managing a wide range of products effectively is key to success.

A POS system with advanced inventory management capabilities not only helps in maintaining efficient operations but also supports strategic decision-making regarding product range, pricing, and promotions. Investing in a POS system that offers comprehensive and flexible inventory management features is a smart move for any business aiming to enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and boost profitability. This not only helps in day-to-day management but also provides strategic insights for long-term business planning.

            In large systems, such as Tier 1 retail chains, inventory management and POS functionalities are typically separated into distinct applications. This separation arises from the complexity of inventory management in large systems and the specialized focus required by the companies developing these applications. POS functionalities often demand developers and specialists with different skill sets compared to those needed for inventory management.

In smaller environments, such as Tier 3, solutions are usually integrated, with inventory management being part of the POS application. This integration simplifies the system, making it more manageable for smaller operations. 
Another important feature of a POS software is sales and marketing. This allows you to process transactions quickly and securely, accept multiple payment methods, and issue receipts and invoices. A good sales and marketing feature should also let you create and manage loyalty programs, gift cards, coupons, and discounts, as well as collect and analyze customer data and feedback. With a powerful sales and marketing feature, you can boost your customer retention, satisfaction, and referrals, and grow your revenue and market share.

            Sales functions and related functionalities are the core of the POS system. When it comes to marketing elements, it’s important to differentiate between the execution and management of retail marketing strategies. 

Execution includes tasks such as handling discounts, coupons, customer loyalty elements like collecting points and rewards etc. The management of these functions,for example features like customer segmentation and business intelligence (BI), are often managed by separate solutions dedicated to these specific tasks. There should be clear separation between this two worlds. 
A third key feature of a POS software is employee management. This allows you to schedule, track, and pay your staff, and assign them roles and permissions. A good employee management feature should also let you monitor and evaluate their performance, productivity, and sales, as well as communicate with them via messages and notifications. With an effective employee management feature, you can improve your staff engagement, motivation, and accountability, and reduce your labor costs and turnover.

            For POS solutions serving Tier 1 and Tier 2 retailers, employee management is only partially integrated into the POS system. Functionalities such as (POS) user management and cash management are included in the POS, while other aspects are typically handled by separate applications dedicated to employee management. This doesn't refer to HR functions but rather to shift management and planning. 
A fourth essential feature of a POS software is reporting and analytics. This allows you to access and visualize your data on your sales, inventory, customers, employees, and more, and generate insights and recommendations. A good reporting and analytics feature should also let you customize and export your reports, as well as integrate with other tools and platforms. With a comprehensive reporting and analytics feature, you can make informed and data-driven decisions, and identify and leverage your strengths and opportunities.

            In the area of reporting, we need to differentiate between reports needed for the daily operation of stores and those required for general management and analytics. The first type, such as tax-related reports mandated by authorities (fiscal law), is relevant only for store operations. The second type involves performance analysis, customer insights, accounting, BI, and so on. These reports handle much more data and are significantly more complex. Therefore, it makes sense to separate them from the POS system and use specialized applications for this purpose. 
A fifth important feature of a POS software is integration and compatibility. This allows you to connect your POS software with other systems and devices that you use in your business, such as accounting, e-commerce, CRM, ERP, and more. A good integration and compatibility feature should also let you sync your data across multiple locations, channels, and platforms, as well as update your software automatically and securely. With a seamless integration and compatibility feature, you can streamline your workflows, enhance your customer experience, and expand your reach and capabilities.

            From my perspective, the integration aspects of a POS solution are the most crucial. There are two main reasons for this:

1. Versatility in Sales Concepts
The POS system must support various sales concepts, requiring seamless integration with different hardware and software.

2. Retail Operations Front End
The POS system serves as the front end of retail operations. Given the multiple back-end systems for each business area, the POS must integrate seamlessly with all of them. 
A sixth key feature of a POS software is user experience and support. This allows you to use your POS software easily and intuitively, and access help and guidance when you need it. A good user experience and support feature should also let you customize your interface, settings, and preferences, as well as provide you with training, documentation, and feedback options. With a positive user experience and support feature, you can increase your POS software usability, efficiency, and reliability, and avoid errors and issues.

            Beginning with the most basic of functions, POS software must offer users the capability to promptly and effortlessly correct errors, including the ability to perform line item and transaction voids. 

For operational efficiencies, users need autonomy to execute tasks such as price overrides and discount applications. Yet, these features should be governed by role-specific permissions with enforced minimum and maximum limits. 

Additionally, the functionality to suspend and later resume transactions is critical, coupled with tracking to maintain oversight on the frequency of cancelled suspended transactions for loss prevention purposes.
