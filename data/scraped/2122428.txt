Energean PLC signed a letter of award with  TechnipFMC for an integrated front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for  delivery of a full-field subsea architecture design for Katlan gas field in  License 12, offshore Israel. The  award follows a five-well East Mediterranean exploration campaign across a  multi-block area that discovered about 68 billion cu m of natural gas, the  company said. In  May, the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure granted official recognition of  the Olympus area natural gas discovery, permitting Energean to apply for a deed  of possession, to submit a development plan, and with Israeli Government  approval, begin development as a producing gas field. At that time, Energean  renamed the area Katlan. In  an April 2023 fact sheet, the company said a development concept was being  finalized. Options under consideration include additional sales to  Israel and exports to Egypt and/or to Cyprus.  The final contract is expected to be completed  in September and the FEED study is expected to be completed by December 2023,  supporting the broader Katlan development program, the company said.
