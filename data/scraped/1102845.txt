Millions of Android users have been exposed to spyware-laden versions of popular messaging apps Telegram and Signal, discovered on the Google Play Store by cybersecurity researchers. These malicious apps, dubbed "Evil Telegram" by Kaspersky researchers, were designed to compromise Android devices and harvest sensitive user information.  



 The spyware-infected apps claimed to offer faster performance compared to the official versions by utilizing a distributed network of global data centers, a lure to attract users. Superficially, these fake apps closely resembled the authentic Telegram, complete with a localized interface, creating the illusion of legitimacy. However, upon closer examination, researchers identified a critical distinction: these counterfeit versions contained an additional module that continuously monitored activities within the messenger application, funnelling substantial amounts of data to a command-and-control server operated by the spyware creators. The spyware was capable of capturing and transmitting a wide range of sensitive data, including user names, IDs, contacts, phone numbers, and chat messages. This unauthorized data collection posed a significant threat to user privacy and security. Despite the apparent similarities to the official versions, these rogue apps were, in reality, modified replicas of the legitimate apps. This subtle difference allowed them to bypass Google Play moderators' scrutiny and gain access to millions of downloads before Google intervened and removed them.

Users are advised to verify the legitimacy of apps, read reviews, and be wary of unofficial versions that promise enhanced performance or additional features, as these may conceal malicious intent.
