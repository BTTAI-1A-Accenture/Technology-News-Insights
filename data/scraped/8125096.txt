The 600-year-old riverside site’s history touches the Tuders, the Civil War and an old naval hospital and college, and these tours tell the gruesome tale of the people who lived, worked – and met their gristly ends through misadventure, bungled high wires acts and anarchistic incompetence– at the Old Royal Naval College throughout the centuries.

Time: 12.30pm & 2.30pm
 
Tickets: £15
 
Address: Old Royal Naval College, Greenwich SE10 9NN

  This supper club, created by the Dinner Ladies, is a creative gastronomical exploration of the seven deadly sins, with each course exploring one of the sins. The dinner pops up at Core Clapton, which will be appropriately transformed into a gothic dining room, lit by candlelight and dressed up with sinful embellishments. Feast on the drama of it all, as well as truffle croquettes, langoustine ceviche, and miso and champagne chowder and one hell of a cocktail menu. Dress up is encouraged.
