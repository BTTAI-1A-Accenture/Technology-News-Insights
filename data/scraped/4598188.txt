   Date (MENAFN) Qatar's favorable government policies and advanced tech infrastructure present a $75 billion investment opportunity in the cleantech industry by 2030, according to a report by Qatar's Investment Promotion Agency. The report highlights Qatar's sustainability initiatives, abundant natural resources, and early-mover advantage in green hydrogen production as factors that position the gas-rich nation as an emerging leader in the cleantech industry. Qatar is well-positioned to take advantage of hydrogen production, which is essential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors, given its abundant solar energy resources.

The report also notes QatarEnergy's announcement to establish the world's largest blue ammonia plant, scheduled to open by 2026, to produce 1.2 million tons annually. The $1 billion plant is projected to support Qatar's efforts to develop carbon capture and storage facilities to isolate as much as 11 million tons of carbon dioxide annually by 2035. QatarEnergy has also launched the Sustainability Strategy, an energy initiative aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of its liquified natural gas facilities by 35 percent by 2030.

Qatar is making great efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, preserve land, and enhance biodiversity to improve indoor air quality in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization. These efforts are embodied in the construction of Lusail City, the leading sustainable city in the country, as well as the development of a network of metro lines powered by green energy. Qatar also hosted the first-of-its-kind carbon-neutral FIFA World Cup in 2022 by using solar-powered stadiums as well as cooling and lighting technology.

With its abundant solar energy resources and commitment to sustainability, Qatar is well-positioned to drive the growth of the cleantech industry in the Middle East and Africa. The country's early-mover advantage in green hydrogen production and QatarEnergy's establishment of the world's largest blue ammonia plant further solidify its position as an emerging leader in the industry. Qatar's efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, preserve land, and enhance biodiversity demonstrate its commitment to sustainability and improving indoor air quality. The development of Lusail City and a network of metro lines powered by green energy are just a few examples of Qatar's efforts to promote sustainable development.MENAFN14052023000045014228ID1106239311 MENAFN14052023000045014228ID1106239311 MENAFN14052023000045014228ID1106239311
