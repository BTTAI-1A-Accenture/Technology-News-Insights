  Market Development  
Fusion bonded epoxy coatings are categorised as thermoset powder coatings that offer resistance to corrosive substances, corrosive soils, extreme temperatures, and hydrocarbons.
The oil & gas industry plays a significant role in shaping the overall steel pipeline industry. This would further demand protective coatings such as FBE.
To gain a strong market position, leading manufacturers are employing different organic and inorganic approaches. Also, the shift from chemical formulations to green formulations is a major strategic approach from the manufacturer side.
Furthermore, manufacturers are making consistent investments in R&D and expansion of production capacity to meet the increasing demand. Easy application with less time during the process is one of the major concerns that market players are trying to address.
 
  Key Takeaways from Market Study     The global FBE coatings market is expected to expand at CAGR of 5.2% and reach US$ 3.7 billion by the end of 2032.   The market's growth rate was 3.5% CAGR for the period of 2017-2021.   Under application, steel pipelines lead the market and are valued at US$ 135.6 million in 2022.   East Asia dominated the global market with 23.5% market share in 2021.   The oil & gas sector is likely to hold 38.6% market share in 2022.   Based on region, demand for FBE coatings is expected to increase at CAGRs of 4.3% and 4%, respectively, in MEA and South Asia & Oceania.     Drivers
