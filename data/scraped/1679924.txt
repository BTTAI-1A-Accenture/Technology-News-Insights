 King Charles is set to travel to Kenya later this year, his first major trip to a Commonwealth country since becoming monarch. The visit will likely be an emotional one for the King as Kenya is where the late Queen was when she found out about her own father's death in 1952. The visit will also take place shortly after the first anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death. Queen Camilla will also join her husband on the trip. The King is also due to visit France next month, a rescheduled event that was originally taking place back in March.

News of the King's visits comes after it has been made aware that the King will spend the first anniversary of his mother's death "quietly and privately". As reported by the Mirror, Palace officials have said that there are "no plans" scheduled to hold any public or private family gatherings.
