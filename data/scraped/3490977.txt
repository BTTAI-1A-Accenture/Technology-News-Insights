 Despite macroeconomic challenges, the technology industry is set for solid growth in the long term, driven by robust demand for advanced technologies and increasing IT spending. While investing in tech stock, Cisco (CSCO) and Extreme Networks (EXTR) could be worth it now, fundamentally weak BlackBerry (BB) might be best avoided in 2023. Keep reading. The Fed's aggressive rate hikes have led to a significant sell-off in technology stocks. Yet, the industry is well-positioned to benefit in the long run, thanks to continuous innovation and the demand for digital transformation across industries. Investors looking to invest in tech stocks could consider buying shares of Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and Extreme Networks, Inc. (EXTR). However, considering the lingering macroeconomic headwinds, I think it is best to steer clear of fundamentally weak BlackBerry Limited (BB) now. The IT sector is transforming with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). AI is transforming traditional IT operations, making them smarter, more time-efficient, and cost-effective. AI has proven to be a valuable tool in quality assurance, service management, and process automation, and AIOps provide a better and more productive approach to managing IT operations. According to the International Data Corporation's (IDC) Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Spending Guide, global spending on artificial intelligence (AI), which includes software, hardware, and services for AI-centric systems, will grow at a 27% CAGR between 2022 and 2026, reaching $300 billion in 2026. Furthermore, the global information technology market is expected to grow at a 10.1% CAGR to reach $1.64 trillion by 2028. Investors' interest in tech stocks is evident from the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW) 5.9% returns over the past three months. However, as recession concerns persist as interest rate hikes are expected to continue amid the still high inflation and a tight labor market, fundamentally weak tech stocks might find it difficult to sustain gains.
