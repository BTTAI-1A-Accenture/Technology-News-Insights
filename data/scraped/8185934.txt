MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- The Big East has named Marquette University's Tyler Kolek Player of the Year and Shaka Smart Coach of the Year.  According to the Associated Press, Kolek and Smart led No. 6 Marquette to a school-record 17 conference wins and its highest national ranking since 1978. A news release from the Big East says, Kolek -- who was named All-BIG EAST First Team on Sunday -- is the fourth player in school history to claim league player of the year accolades.  He joins Jim McIlvaine (1993-94, Great Midwest Conference), Dwyane Wade (2002-03, Conference USA) and Jae Crowder (2011-12, BIG EAST).  Kolek is the first player since Providence's Kris Dunn in 2014-15 (shared with Villanova's Ryan Arcidiacono) to earn the accolade after not receiving preseason recognition at the league's annual media day. The Big East says Smart, who is in his 14th season as head coach, was honored for the first time in his career as the league's top coach.  He was a unanimous selection by his coaching peers after guiding MU to the regular season title following its ninth-place selection in the preseason poll.  Kevin O'Neill (GMC - 1992-93 and 1993-94) and Tom Crean (C-USA – 2001-02, 2002-03) are the only Marquette coaches to previously claim a conference award. The Golden Eagles headed to New York this week, with another chance to make team history. MU won the outright Big East regular season title for the first time and its the top-seed in the conference tournament.  Your 2023 @BIGEASTMBB Coach of the Year, @CoachShakaSmart! #MUBB | #WeAreMarquettepic.twitter.com/eO5ksz6kLr People are people through other people.
