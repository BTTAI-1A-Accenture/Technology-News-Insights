The University of Lincoln hosted a transformative event, titled “Creating Employable Graduates: A Sector Panel Talk on Developing Graduates for the Future”. The event, opened by the esteemed Vice-Chancellor, Professor Neal Juster, saw a distinguished panel of experts sharing invaluable insights, and took place at the British Council’s headquarters in New Delhi, India.
Drawing on key themes from the fourth edition of the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report, the panel discussion delved into the crux of employability skills. Mr. Ashok Swaminathan and Mr. Ashish Dwivedi highlighted the growing significance of advanced technical skills, such as AI, Cloud Computing, and Data Analytics.
The Vice-Chancellor of University of Lincoln, Neal Juster said, “University of Lincoln has strong relationships with many industries.” Providing the example of the health services, he added “that University of Lincoln has a number of allied health courses working together with National Health Services (NHS) to produce and provide graduates, adding to not just Lincolnshire, but the entirety of UK. A notable number of Pharmacists were created with the introduction of several new courses. With the help of this, the University of Lincoln is successfully creating 60-70 Pharmacists each year.”
Kapil Dua, CEO and Co-founder of Sannams4 Group, emphasized the importance of commercial awareness, competitor analysis, and a positive attitude toward acquiring new skills. A quote from him resonated deeply with the audience, “AI will not replace managers; it will replace managers that do not use AI.” The subsequent discussion focused on the advantages of an overseas degree compared to one obtained in India. Industry experts unanimously agreed that an international degree enhances an applicant’s adaptability and independent thinking, providing a substantial edge in the job market.
A notable addition to the discussion was made by Deeksha Terri, an alumna of the University of Lincoln and a senior sub-editor at the Indian Express. She underlined the diminishing relevance of educational qualifications and stressed the vital role of hands-on experience and adaptability in the contemporary job market. This led to a thought-provoking discussion, where Jamie Arrowsmith from UUKi pointed out that critical thinking and the ability to conduct independent research are equally pivotal in certain job roles.
The key takeaways included the importance of soft skills in the work place, future-proofing university curriculums, and examples of industry to academia collaborations.
Deeksha, an international student herself, highlighted the life skills nurtured by overseas education, further enhancing employability. The panel also deliberated on what academic institutions can do to enhance graduate success rates, proposing: – Increased industrial liaisons for internships and placements, Periodic skill development sessions to improve CV and interview skills, Development of a robust alumni network, and Implementation of incubator and accelerator programs.
The discussion also lauded India’s commendable efforts to promote employment and entrepreneurial initiatives, such as Skill India and Make In India. The session concluded on a positive note, acknowledging that apart from AI and computing, other sectors such as global logistics, creative industries, and fintech offer promising career avenues.
India, as a nation, is progressing in the global perspective, with its students heading in the right direction to attain the necessary skills for enhanced employability.
