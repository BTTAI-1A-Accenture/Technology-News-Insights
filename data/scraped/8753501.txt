 The Aromajoin Aroma Shooter is a groundbreaking device seemingly plucked straight from the realms of Ernest Cline's "Ready Player One" or the Star Trek Holodeck. As the buzz around the Metaverse and virtual reality (VR) intensifies, companies are striving to enhance the authenticity of the virtual world. Aromajoin has been at the forefront of this, releasing a series of devices aimed at integrating one of the last unexplored senses in VR: smell. With an Aromajoin device, users can immerse themselves in a virtual world or film, experiencing not just the visuals and sounds, but also the scents associated with the on-screen environment. Whether you're watching a cooking show and smelling delicious food, or engrossed in a nature documentary surrounded by the scent of fresh rain or soil, Aromajin enhances the sensory experience. The latest addition to its product range is a wearable vest: the Aromajoin Aroma Shooter. This innovative device, worn like a vest, houses multiple scent cartridges. As users navigate a compatible VR system, the vest can emit corresponding scents to match the on-screen environment. The Aroma Shooter employs a non-spraying system, ensuring users aren't subjected to a direct aerosol blast. Instead, they'll gradually begin to perceive the scents associated with their virtual surroundings. It's not at all necessary for going online, but for the absolute optimum online experience, this new gadget will get users deeper into a Matrix-esque experience, further blurring the lines between the virtual and the real. 
 The Covid-19 pandemic marked a turning point in modern history, affecting everything, including technology. Dyson has introduced a unique creation that seems to come straight out of a science fiction movie. The Dyson Zone Air Purifying Headphones are both stylish and functional. They're an impressive set of noise-canceling headphones that are built with eight active noise-canceling microphones to help filter sounds, so all you can hear is your music. The headphones are brawny and comfortable but with built-in filter tech, they are heavier than most headsets. They come with a sturdy carrying case that houses both the headphones and a detachable filter element. Dyson's unusual air-purifying headphones incorporate two types of filters. The first is an electrostatic filter, which can intercept most allergens and particulates as small as 0.1 microns. Given that most allergen particles range in size from one to 30 microns, the Zone is capable of eliminating the vast majority of allergens when operating at full power. The second is an activated charcoal filter that helps capture fumes and other vapors like nitrogen dioxide. Nothing actually touches the user's face when the filter is activated. Instead, it uses a continuous air system, like a CPAP machine, to deliver clean air directly to the user's breathing pathways. This design allows users to breathe filtered air without the discomfort of a mask. Additionally, the filter features an integrated app that can monitor the air quality in your immediate surroundings in real-time. 
 It may seem a little odd, but one of the best sources of health information you have available gets flushed down the toilet daily. The Withings U-Scan, a hands-free home urinalysis device, offers an innovative and surprisingly effective source of health information. This device, installed in your toilet bowl like a cleaning pod, utilizes interchangeable sensor pods to analyze your urine for various health indicators. The data is then seamlessly synced to a dedicated app, eliminating the need for manual readings. The U-Scan provides valuable insights into your health status. It can assess a range of factors, including real-time hydration and fitness data, and subsequently provide comprehensive health recommendations based on these findings. For women, the device also includes a sensor designed to monitor menstrual cycles and offer advice based on hormonal balance. Withings is even contemplating the development of a commercial version for hospital use, highlighting the device's capabilities. Designed for convenience, the U-Scan is automatically cleaned with each toilet flush. Its battery life is an impressive three months, reducing the need for frequent removal and recharging. This device represents a significant advancement in home health technology, providing critical health insights from an unexpected source. 
 One of the coolest scenes in movie history is in "Aliens" where Ellen Ripley gets into a wearable exoskeleton and battles the queen alien. This iconic scene, once a figment of science fiction, is closer to reality in 2023. While the U.S. government may have just revealed the existence of aliens, the real news is German Bionic's new practical, wearable exoskeleton. German Bionic's Apogee is a wearable device that can help save workers' joints and backs. It helps them move, bend, and lift large objects with proper form to get work done faster while protecting their health. In 2022 alone, over a million ergonomic injuries, including herniated discs, torn ligaments, overexertion, sprains, and tears, occurred in workplaces. The Apogee hopes to significantly reduce these numbers by alleviating physical strain and optimizing user performance. The Apogee can help users lift with proper form which can help prevent back injuries. In addition, the exoskeleton can also monitor the user's health data to ensure they are using best safety practices. Finally, when it comes to lift capacity the Apogee increases the user carrying capacity by approximately 60lbs. Wearable exoskeletons have been in development for years, but the Apogee is not prohibitively bulky. The Apogee is compact in comparison and has several different attachments and harness sizes to accommodate various sizes so companies won't have to buy specific-sized exoskeletons for different-sized people. This makes the Apogee a versatile and cost-effective solution in the realm of wearable technology. 
 eBikes and scooters are a fantastic way to get around cities for a commute or just for fun. They have popped up in almost every major city and laws and regulations are only now just catching up to them after a sharp spike in injuries. Despite a top speed of only around 25mph, eBikes can pose serious risks to riders, potentially resulting in severe injuries or even fatalities in the event of a crash. Bosch, a leading eBike manufacturer, turned to existing technology for a solution. Just revealed in 2023, Bosch has put the same anti-lock brake system (ABS) that is used in cars and motorbikes on its bikes. The incorporation of ABS significantly enhances rider safety. ABS prevents the wheels from locking up and forcing your vehicle to skid. Without an ABS system, your wheels will most likely lock and your vehicle will skid forward until coming to a stop either through the brakes or hitting an obstacle. Once the brakes lock, control becomes nearly impossible. However, ABS allows riders to apply the brakes fully while retaining the ability to steer their vehicle, potentially avoiding a collision. While not a new technology, using ABS in eBikes is a pioneering move. Safety technology is always an exciting field that significantly impacts consumers. After all, most drivers were hesitant to buy cars with seatbelts when first released, so it's exciting to see positive hype over a new safety feature. 
 If you're a "Transformers" superfan, you'll remember the epic moment when the Dino Bots, led by the mighty Grimlock, first stomped onto the scene. Well, Robosen is bringing that thrill back to life in 2023 with a fully operational Grimlock Robot. This is a far cry from the dancing robots you see at your local toy store. Robosen's Grimlock is outrageously overengineered for a toy. It comes fully equipped to transform from a dinosaur to a walking transformer automatically and it can walk and move in both forms. In addition, it comes with its own proprietary software so users can program its fully articulated limbs to make moves in any way that they want. This allows for a high degree of customization, as the Grimlock Robot can be reprogrammed to perform a high degree of desired actions. Adding to its impressive features, the Grimlock Robot is fully voice-activated and can be programmed with a variety of voice commands. In a nod to the franchise's fans, Robosen enlisted Gregg Berger, the original voice actor for Grimlock, to record over 150 new lines for the robot to recite. This is not just a toy, but a sophisticated piece of technology. With its advanced functionality and undeniable cool factor, it carries a correspondingly higher price tag. The Robosen Grimlock Robot is available at a retail price of approximately $1,500. 
 In this modern age where we're always surrounded by technology, it's no surprise that even our trusty old pens are getting a digital makeover. Meet the Nuwa Pen. At first glance, it looks like any other pen, but it's actually loaded with cameras and powered by super-smart artificial intelligence (AI). At its core, the Nuwa Pen functions like a traditional writing instrument, allowing users to draw, write, and do anything a normal pen can do.

The Sound Burger is a portable vinyl record player that looks like an oversized hair straightener. It opens up like a clip where users can place a vinyl record. It's extremely compact compared to any other record player on the market, and the sound quality is worthy of Audio-Technica. The newest version released in 2023 comes equipped with a Bluetooth connection to allow users to play from any Bluetooth speaker system or headphones. If you're a vinyl collector looking for a unique and high-quality record player, the Sound Burger is worth a look. 
 AR glasses have been around for a while. If you were following tech news in 2012 you may remember a really hyped-up promo for Google Glass. However, after they were unveiled, the glasses failed to gain enough popularity to get much traction. Simply put, they were big and goofy-looking and looked like a bad cosplay of Universal Soldier. However, 2023 could mark the resurgence of AR glasses. After years of technological advancements and design improvements, today's AR glasses bear little resemblance to their predecessors. They no longer look like safety goggles with a laser pointer attached, but instead resemble and function as regular eyewear. Lumus AR Lenses are a fresh approach to augmented reality. The lenses utilize a dual-mirror reflection system to generate images for the user while maintaining lens transparency. This innovative feature can bring any AR-compatible content to life. One of the most practical applications of this technology is for navigation and GPS. If you're navigating an unfamiliar city, the glasses can display real-time directions on the lens. It's a cool feature and the tech world is only just scratching the surface on what AR can do. The combination of style and functionality will determine whether these AR glasses are well received and only time will tell. 
 In 2022, the U.S. FDA removed restrictions on hearing aids. Instead of going to a specialist, patients can simply go to their local pharmacy and purchase a set of over-the-counter hearing aids. JLab is a pioneering tech company that has introduced such over-the-counter hearing aids. Typically, prescription hearing aids range from $1,000 to $6,000 in price. However, JLab's over-the-counter hearing aid, unveiled at the 2023 Consumer Electronic Show, will be incredibly affordable, retailing at just $99. This price point is particularly promising for individuals with hearing impairments who may not have insurance coverage. The device looks like a sleek wireless earbud that fits snugly into the ear. It can then filter and amplify noise and sound to the user. They also work like any other headphones and can be connected via Bluetooth to any other compatible system. In addition, JLab is currently working on creating a customizable fit version that will be even more secure in the user's ear. Each device also comes with a 2-year warranty. This is a game changer in the tech and medical world and can potentially change people's lives for the better.
