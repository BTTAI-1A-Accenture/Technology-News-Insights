 Forbes Advisor evaluated more than a dozen time clock software to pick the best ones. All the apps were evaluated on these criteria: Featured Partners 1 OnPay Yes Yes $40 per month + $6 per user 1 OnPay On OnPay's Website 2 SurePayroll Yes Yes $29.99/mo plus $5 per employee 2 SurePayroll On SurePayroll's Website 3 Gusto Yes Yes $40 per month plus $6 per user 3 Gusto On Gusto's Website 4 Rippling Yes Yes $35/month plus $8 PEPM 4 Rippling On Rippling's Website 5 Justworks Yes Yes $50/month + $8/user 5 Justworks On Justworks' Website All-time clock software provides basic features, such as clock in/out, time of tracking, administrative control and scheduling. It is the additional features that make one software more suitable than others for your organization. These are some additional factors that you should look at before picking the best software option for you. A time clock software tracks employee hours accurately. But what after that? The most important crucial use of timesheet data is to calculate payroll correctly every pay cycle. Entering timesheet data manually can introduce human errors and is time-consuming as well. When looking for a Time clock software, consider which integrates with the payroll system you are already using (or plan to use). It can be a lot to ask your employees to take out their laptops or log into their desktops for punching time, whether they need those devices for work or not. It is much more convenient and quicker to provide mobile access to the time clock software for both employees and their managers. But all time clock software doesn’t provide mobile access in all their plans. Be careful to check plans for mobile access features. If your employees need to be in different places for doing their work, it is crucial that the time clock software has GPS and geofencing capabilities. This will enable you to track the location from where they are clocking in and even assign locations beforehand. This helps you optimize labor costs by paying employees only for the hours worked. They cannot clock in time while sitting in their homes. For businesses that work in shifts, employee scheduling is a must-have feature with time clock software. Some apps will send out notifications and even alert the employees if they do not clock in when their shift is scheduled to start. Scheduling shifts and break times can help you be compliant with labor laws as well as prevent unauthorized clock-ins. Some apps also allow employees to request time off or sick days so that the managers can plan accordingly. Tracking employee hours can provide useful insights into project progress. Time clock software is often part of a suite of tools that also includes project management features, such as tracking job progress, task assignment, creating and managing schedules and project reports. Project management tools over and above time clock software also enable you to estimate proposed project time requirements and labor costs.

If you operate in an industry with specialized time clock needs, look for software that is designed specifically for you. Time clock software is an advantage for both employees and employers. Some benefits of time using time clock software include: According to Forbes Advisor’s evaluation of more than a dozen time clock software choices, Time Doctor is the best overall app for clocking in and out.
