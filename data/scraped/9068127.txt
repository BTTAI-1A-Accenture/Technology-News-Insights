TikTok truly is a black hole of wellness hacks. I have spent too much time on the app checking out weird food trends and watching “girl dinner” videos. The latest TikTok trend taking over my FYP is all about bee pollen. And according to TikTok, there are some pretty wild benefits of bee pollen. I was scrolling through my FYP as usual when I came across a viral video posted by a user by the name of @imtaylorreynolds talking about the benefits of bee pollen, specifically talking about how taking bee pollen regularly made her breasts grow. WTF? Of course, I was intrigued to learn more about bee pollen and how this could be. I watched another video posted by a user by the name of @lifebylaurenralph, discussing the overall benefits of bee pollen and why she recommends taking it.  The few videos I watched convinced me to buy bee pollen and take it on a regular basis. But, before I purchased it, I wanted to speak to a nutritionist about all of the bee pollen myths circulating on TikTok and also get a general idea of the benefits of taking bee pollen. So I spoke to nutritionist Michelle Blum, founder of NutrishMish, about bee pollen, the overall benefits, and if those myths are really true.  Replying to @qualeeerika Here’s the benefits of bee pollen!

I was curious if implementing bee pollen into my everyday vitamin regimen would be of benefit to me, and thankfully, Blum has some answers. “Bee pollen contains a ton of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. It is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and has antiviral properties as well,” Blum tells Her Campus. “People add it to smoothies, shakes, or salads. It has definitely earned its title as a superfood.” In addition to bee pollen containing lots of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, it’s great for your immune system. “Bee pollen is also thought to boost the immune system and is considered antibacterial as well as antiviral,” Blum says.  If you struggle with symptoms related to menopause, implementing bee pollen might be a good idea. “Studies also suggest it helps with symptoms related to menopause, such as hot flashes — this is also where the potential increase in breast size comes in,” Blum tells Her Campus.  bee pollen review (i wore yellow for the occasion) #beepollen #review  The biggest question I had for Blum was the relation between bee pollen and an increase in breast size. Blum said the answer to this is two-fold. “There have been no studies to confirm this, however, it’s only because it doesn’t seem as though studies have ever really been conducted,” Blum tells Her Campus.  “Many women do report an increase in breast size after taking bee pollen, and it makes sense, for the same reason it helps reduce menopausal symptoms,” Blum tells Her Campus. “Bee pollen has something called phytoestrogen compounds. This means it can fit into estrogen receptors in the breast and activate them, which could stimulate breast tissue. Whether you notice a difference or not will depend on your current hormone makeup, so some women might and some might not.”  Now that I know bee pollen has the ability to increase breast tissue for some, I was curious if it had any other benefits to women’s health and wellness. Blum states that taking bee pollen could have beneficial effects on women’s health. “Bee pollen does contain B vitamins, which play a key role in reproductive health, and can also possibly help with PMS and menopausal symptoms as well,” Blum tells Her Campus. “This all depends on a woman’s current hormonal status, so always check with your doctor before starting any vitamins or supplements.” Turns out the myths are somewhat true. Bee pollen is something I will definitely be adding into my daily vitamins and supplements!  Blum advises readers to know that just like with any supplement, it is always a good idea to check with your doctor. Bee pollen is considered safe overall, but there could be risk of allergic reaction, or interaction with other medications, so for that reason, always check with your doctor.
