Convergence, the latest League of Legends spinoff, finally has a release date – and it’s coming out relatively soon. On Tuesday, Riot Games and developer Double Stallion announced that Convergence: A League of Legends Story will release on May 23, 2023, for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store.  The premise for this one is rather interesting – you’ll play as Ekko, a fan-favorite League of Legends champion, where time manipulation is vital to successfully navigating mind-bending 2D levels. You can check out snippets of new gameplay in the latest Convergence: A League of Legends Story trailer below. Apparently, there’ll be a significant emphasis on storytelling in Convergence, which shouldn’t come as a surprise given how Riot Games has been fleshing out the League of Legends universe with stuff like the Emmy Award-Winning Arcane – though it’s a shame that Season 2 isn’t releasing in 2023. Convergence is only the latest in a long line of League of Legends spinoff games. There’s also Mageseeker, Hextech Mayhem, and Ruined King – all of which are already out. As for the future, Riot is looking to shake up fighting games with Project L, though there’s still no release date information on that one. Written by Kyle Campbell on behalf of GLHF.
