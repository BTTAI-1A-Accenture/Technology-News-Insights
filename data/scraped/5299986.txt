Like many of us, Rossella Rago has taken cooking lessons from her grandmother. Her grandmother is such a wealth of culinary knowledge that Rago hosts a show with her called "Cooking With Nonna" on Instagram and YouTube.  And earlier this year, Rago released her a cookbook featuring 130 recipes for Italian comfort food that stemmed from her time living with her grandmother.  One recipe that impressed and delighted us from "Cooking with Nonna: Sunday Dinners with La Famiglia" is "Italian Meatball Cookies," which Rago says are "a chocolatey spiced cookie that recall the Italian American cookie trays of yesteryear." Her version is meant to look even more meatball-ish with a red glaze and white nonpareils.  Here's grandma's treasured recipe:This Christmas cookie has been a family favorite for 60 years For the picture-perfect sugar cookie:Try this royal icing recipe Makes: About two dozen cookies Ingredients for the cookies: Ingredients for the glaze: Instructions to make the cookies: Instructions to make the glaze: Nonna’s Tip: If you love the look of these cookies but aren’t a fan of spice, you can leave out or adjust the spice level to your liking. The chocolate flavor of the cookies is lovely on its own! Copyrighted material, property of Harper Horizon.
