They couldn’t bear the temptation. A mama black bear and her cub were caught on camera helping themselves to some Krispy Kreme doughnuts during a delivery to a military base in Anchorage, Alaska. The animals raided a van at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson after the driver left the door open when he stopped at the Express store, KTUU reported. “You could hear them breaking open the packages,” store manager Shelly Deano told the outlet. “We were trying to beat on the van but they just kept eating all the doughnuts. “They ate 20 packages of the doughnut holes and I believe six packages of the three-pack chocolate doughnuts,” she added. Deano snapped a few pictures of the raid. “I said, ‘He’s in the van!’ and then the little cub followed and went inside the van and they just started eating the doughnuts,” she said, adding that she called base security personnel, who blasted sirens to shoo the bears. Candice Sargeant, a local Krispy Kreme general manager, said she was shocked when she learned about the brazen bear bandits. “There’s no way that bears are in the back of the van. You’d think doughnuts and bears, and then I was like, ‘OK, how do we solve this?’” she told the station. Sargeant said her team has learned a lesson from the incident. “We’ll definitely be learning to slide up our ramp, close the doors, to ensure that bears don’t get back in there again,” she told KTUU with a laugh.
