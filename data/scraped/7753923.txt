	In an age where technology intertwines with every aspect of our lives, it takes an exceptional innovator to stand out from the crowd. Indian born AI scientist, Somdip Dey, recognized by many for his ground-breaking work in the tech industry, is such an individual. This industry stalwart, known for his roles at tech giants like Samsung and his ventures into solving global challenges, has embarked on a fascinating new journey - a venture into the world of music, using AI as his instrument of choice. 
	When you mention the name Somdip Dey to someone familiar with the tech world, they might first think of his acclaimed tech startup, Nosh Technologies. An initiative aimed at curbing food wastage using advanced AI, Nosh Technologies showcases Dey's knack for employing cutting-edge technology to address global issues. Yet, in recent times, a new epithet has been added to his name, that of 'InteliDey', his music production alias. 
	InteliDey is not your typical music producer. He doesn't strum a guitar or play the piano. Instead, he uses algorithms and neural networks to churn out melodies. The capability of InteliDey's technology is vast: it can adapt to various musical styles and even innovate by creating entirely novel genres. For the sceptics who doubt the soul or authenticity of AI- generated music, Dey's work serves as a testament to the harmony of technology and art. 
	Music, like any form of art, has always been considered a medium of human expression. The idea that a machine, devoid of emotions, can create music that resonates with human emotions might seem counterintuitive. But InteliDey’s music asks listeners to reassess such preconceived notions. Dey's assertion is compelling: AI can democratize music production. Through AI, he envisions a future where everyone, irrespective of their music proficiency, can compose top-notch tracks. 
	Not just an artistic endeavour, Dey’s venture into AI music also seeks to address some pressing challenges that artists face today. With the digital age ushering in new modes of music consumption, artists often grapple with generating sustainable revenue. In addressing this, Dey has explored innovative avenues, such as incorporating NFTs into music, thereby ensuring musicians can reap the financial benefits they deserve. 
	The recognition of Dey's ingenuity isn't confined to niche tech circles. Prestigious publications like TechCrunch, Entrepreneur, South China Morning Post, Business Insider, and Forbes have spotlighted his ground-breaking work in technology. Further attesting to his prowess, he's earned the distinction of being named an "MIT Innovator Under 35 in AI/Robotics" by the MIT Technology Review in Europe. His remarkable contributions have also garnered recognition at National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU)’s 2023 India UK Achievers Honours, including being named an 'Outstanding Achiever’, sharing the accolade with noted personalities such as Parineeti Chopra, Raghav Chadha, and Adar Poonawalla. 
	2023 marked a significant milestone for InteliDey: the release of his debut tech house album, "Future Retro Love" Comprising 12 fusion melodic tech house tracks, this album is no ordinary collection of beats and rhythms. Each track, spun from the threads of AI, weaves together elements from the mystical Celtic culture and juxtaposes them with futuristic melodic tech house beats. This blend of the old with the new, tradition with modernity, organic with digital, makes "Future Retro Love" an album of contrasts that yet harmonize beautifully, much like Dey’s own journey from tech to music. 
	However, as much as he's a tech whiz and musical maverick, Dey's commitment to societal betterment is equally admirable. His contributions to the Nosh app, developed alongside Indian computer engineer Suman Saha, is a testament to his dedication. This app harnesses AI to tackle food wastage and subsequently, reduce carbon emissions. Dey's conviction is that AI is more than just codes and algorithms. For him, it's a tool to usher in positive changes, to address some of the pressing challenges humanity faces. 
	In conclusion, Somdip Dey or InteliDey is not just a name but a symbol of the confluence of art, technology, and societal responsibility. His journey from the corridors of Samsung and Nosh Technologies to the dance floors reverberating with "Future Retro Love" exemplifies the boundless potential of AI. It serves as an inspiration and a reminder: technology, when used with creativity and vision, can redefine boundaries and craft a future we had only dreamt of.
