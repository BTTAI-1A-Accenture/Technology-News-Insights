Suspect taken into custody in Massachusetts A man is in custody in connection with the shooting death of his mother, which happened at her home in a rural area of New Hampshire. James Coe, 20, was arrested in Revere, Massachusetts, on Wednesday and charged with being a fugitive from justice, according to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. Authorities said a warrant was issued for Coe earlier in the day, charging him with second-degree murder for causing the death of his mother, 59-year-old Denise Damato-Coe, by shooting her with a rifle at her Danville home on Thursday, Aug. 3. Damato-Coe's body was found dead inside her home late Thursday evening by Danville police officers who responded to a 911 call for help. An autopsy performed by Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jennie Duval on Friday determined the cause of Damato-Coe's death was multiple gunshot wounds and the manner of her death was homicide, according to authorities. The attorney general's office said Coe was also charged with falsifying physical evidence for knowingly altering, concealing and removing the rival used to commit the murder. Coe is currently being held without bail and is set to be arraigned in Chelsea District Court in the near future. That arraignment will be followed by extradition proceedings to New Hampshire, according to authorities.
