Egnyte has expanded its office in Reading to meet increasing demand. The firm, which offers a secure IT platform for content collaboration and governance, has taken on more space at the Pinnacle in a move it says will help attract talent in the region while meeting increasing demand for its data security and governance solutions. The company also has an office in Poznań, Poland, as part of its European operations. “This office expansion is critical as the needs of our employees continue to evolve,” said Ben Saville, Head of EMEA at Egnyte.

The space will support plans to expand the company’s EMEA channel and vertical market strategy, including Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). “As one of the fastest growing economies in the UK, Reading was a natural fit to base Egnyte’s EMEA operations,” added Saville. “The centrality of the office itself is very convenient as it is located near a variety of shops and restaurants, in addition to new development.” Stephen Emerson is the Managing Editor of The Business Magazine and is responsible for the publication's print publications and online properties including the newly launched Biz News websites in Hampshire and Dorset.   Stephen has been a journalist for  20 years and has worked at local, regional and national publications and led a team which made The Scotsman website one of the fastest growing news sites in the UK with over eight million monthly users.   He has a keen interest in technology, property and corporate finance and telling the stories of the people behind the successful firms in these sectors.
