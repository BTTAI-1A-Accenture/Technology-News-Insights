 Global specialty insurer Markel Australia (Markel) has appointed Stephen Rogers as the new head of Queensland. The appointment is part of Markel's goal to serve the Australian market with a high-quality local presence. Rogers joined Markel from AXA XL, where he was a casualty manager who led the liability construction practice. With over two decades of experience in the Australian insurance sector, Rogers has casualty expertise that aligns with Markel's focus on liability insurance and underwriting and has a successful track record for producing longer-term liability insurance solutions for clients in the construction and resources industries. Brisbane-based Rogers will report to Melbourne-based managing director Rory Morison, with the company's offices in Brisbane and Melbourne under their leadership. Morison said that Rogers’ expertise will be crucial to expanding Markel's footprint and offering tailored insurance across Queensland.  “[Rogers] brings deep sector knowledge across construction and resources and will be able to provide solutions for sustainable long-term coverage and local partnerships,” Morison said. “With the establishment of a strong and proven team of underwriting leaders in the Australian market, we are able to step up support for local clients and brokers, delivering the next phase in Markel's international expansion. “I look forward to working with Steve and having his support as we build an empowered underwriting offering in the market. This approach, combined with Markel's commitment to building a collaborative and entrepreneurial culture, positions us for continued success in Australia.” Last month, Markel Group announced its expansion into Australia with the opening of three offices.
