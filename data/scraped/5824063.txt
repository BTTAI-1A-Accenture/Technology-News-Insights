At one point one of the most dominant champions in MMA, Max Holloway is currently on the outside looking in. The “Blessed” one is 0-3 against UFC featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski and is trying to fight back to contender status. If he beats rising star Arnold Allen on April 15, Holloway may get his wish.  Holloway faces Allen inside the T-Mobile Center in Kansa City, and it airs on ESPN+.  The 31-year-old Holloway turned pro in 2010. Joining the UFC in 2012, he is 19-7 with the promotion and won the featherweight title in 2017. Losing the title against Volkanovski in 2019, he lost two more times against the Aussie in 2020 and 2022. "Never say never,” Holloway told ESPN about a fourth fight with Volkanovski via MMA Junkie. “A lot of people are like, ‘It’s hard to get a fourth with him – there’s a lot of things that need to happen.’ I’m like, you could tell me whatever it is, I’m not even supposed to be here. I was never, ever supposed to be a UFC champion at any point in my career, supposedly. So at the end of the day, don’t count it out.” MORE: Sign up to watch UFC Kansas City: Holloway vs. Allen on ESPN+ Turning pro in 2012, Allen joined the UFC in 2015.
