Season series: Arizona leads 1-0 Arizona hit 3 home runs en route to a 6-2 triumph in Thursday’s series lid-lifter. The win snapped a 3-game road losing streak for the Diamondbacks.

Cubs 4, Diamondbacks 3 The Chicago Cubs have hit the Moneyline in 18 of their last 25 games at home (+8.80 Units, 25% ROI). Arizona is just 9-19 on the road in the 2nd half. Chicago has been bashing right-handed pitching of late (.825 OPS in 2nd half), and Taillon’s home numbers are sullied by a .365 batting average on balls in play. He’s a fly-baller helped by a breeze favoring pitchers in the forecast. Leveraging FanDuel Sportsbook for the best odds here, BET THE CUBS (+102). The Cubs’ end of this action is drowning in juice. PASS. There is some Under shading to the prognostication for this one, but the public is all over it. Keep an eye on FanDuel’s O/U if a 7.5 stays listed and gets to -115, that mix would have some minimal value. Otherwise, PASS.
