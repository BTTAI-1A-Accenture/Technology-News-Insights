MACK HANSEN 6An injury doubt beforehand, it was a big blow to lose the wing dangerman after only 53 minutes. GARRY RINGROSE 5Poor defensively and failed to have much of an influence on the attacking side. BUNDEE AKI 8Another try for the reel and toiled hard defensively. Devastated to be going home. JAMES LOWE 7Industrious display but had to do most of his work in defence. JOHNNY SEXTON 7Bows out with his dream finish unfulfilled. Will be annoyed to miss second-half penalty. JAMISON GIBSON-PARK 7Did well to snaffle his try before half-time but withdrawn early. ANDREW PORTER 6Tough night for the scrum and for the loosehead particularly. Coughed up penalties. DAN SHEEHAN 5Lineout malfunctioned and at fault with van der Flier for second All Blacks try. Disappointing. TADHG FURLONG 7Poured everything into his 53 minutes. Solid in scrum and 14 tackles. TADHG BEIRNE 7Put in the hard yards once more with 17 tackles. One of Ireland's best players in France. IAIN HENDERSON 5Failed to exert himself on the lineout and the game in James Ryan's absence. PETER O'MAHONY 6Didn't have the big moments he used to on the big occasion. JOSH VAN DER FLIER 6Came up with 17 tackles in an hour before tiredness took hold. CAELAN DORIS 5One big turnover but, once again, knows he could have done better on the big stage. FINLAY BEALHAM 6 (for Furlong 53) JIMMY O'BRIEN 7 (for Hansen 56) JOE MCCARTHY 7 (for Henderson 59) JACK CONAN 6 (for van der Flier 59) CONOR MURRAY 7 (for Gibson-Park 62) RONAN KELLEHER 7 (for Sheehan 64) DAVE KILCOYNE 6 (for Porter 76) MAN OF THE MATCH  Sam Cane (NZ) Just edges Beauden Barrett's clever kicking game due to his immense defensive work. Inspirational from the All Blacks captain. Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.
