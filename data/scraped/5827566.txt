Shanghai, China, October 18, 2023 — FedEx Express, a subsidiary of FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) and one of the world’s largest express transportation companies, has announced the launch of FedEx Ship ManagerTM Lite (FSM Lite), a new mobile shipping solution in Mainland China. This innovative offering is designed to provide local customers with faster and more convenient paperless shipping services. As a mobile shipping solution, FSM Lite enables ad hoc account shippers and non-account shippers to effortlessly input shipping information on their smart devices and generate a shipment reference QR code without the need to create or log in to a FedEx account. This QR code can be presented by customers, simplifying the process of dropping off shipments at FedEx stations or scheduling courier pickups. This streamlined process reduces the necessity for customers to print waybills or commercial invoices, leading to a notable reduction in paper consumption. In addition, FSM Lite integrates the FedEx online export declaration tool iClear, which allows customers in Mainland China to electronically submit trade data, offering them a smoother preparation process for customs clearance for low-value outbound shipments (Category C shipments). With FSM Lite, customers can simply input their Category C shipment details during order placement, ensuring a seamless and efficient clearance by simultaneously completing both shipment creation and export declaration processes. “The launch of FSM Lite demonstrates the company’s commitment to leveraging digital technology to enhance logistics efficiency. It also empowers our local customers to expand their global reach,” said Eddy Chan, Senior Vice President of FedEx Express and President of FedEx China. “The innovative integration of FSM Lite and iClear simplifies the shipping and export declaration process, significantly enhancing ease of use and export efficiency for our customers. Moreover, this reinforces our mission to connect the world responsibly and resourcefully through reduced use of paper in the shipping process.” FedEx continues to drive its digital transformation, aiming to improve shipping experiences for customers worldwide. In September, FedEx introduced a new automated e-commerce capability in FedEx Ship Manager™, enabling businesses to easily create shipments and paperwork from their online orders in a few simple steps. This enhancement is designed to assist e-commerce merchants across the AMEA region in efficiently managing their shipments online.
