Her father offered her advice she will never forget. She was down, depressed and didn't know how she would get through the holiday season in 2014.  Laura Timbario-Quering, who was an elementary school teacher on Chicago's South Side, had been pregnant. She lost the baby and couldn't imagine what pain Christmas would bring. Her father told her, "Maybe, if you give to others ..." Giving, John Timbario said, just might make her feel better. He had raised her in an atmosphere where volunteering and giving were a regular part of their lives. So she started a Secret Santa giveaway, and found out what she knew all along: Her father was right.
