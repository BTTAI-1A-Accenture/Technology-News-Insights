NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MSCI Inc. (NYSE: MSCI), a leading provider of mission-critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 66% of The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”) for $697 million in cash. Burgiss is a Hoboken, New Jersey-based market-leading provider of data, analytics, and technology solutions for investors in private assets. Since its initial investment in January 2020, MSCI will have invested an aggregate of $913 million to acquire all of Burgiss.

  
With over 35 years of expertise in alternative investments, Burgiss offers private asset data, analytics, and software applications, including leading research-quality performance data that dates back to 1978. The Burgiss dataset covers over 13,000 private asset funds around the world, representing $15 trillion in cumulative investments across private equity, private real estate, private debt, infrastructure, and natural resources in 195 countries. Burgiss serves approximately 1,000 clients – limited partners, general partners, and financial intermediaries – in 40 countries with 650+ employees across the U.S., Europe, Asia Pacific, and South Africa.

 
Burgiss’ leadership across all private asset classes complements MSCI’s own leading position in private real estate, which includes Real Capital Analytics, acquired in September 2021. MSCI currently offers private real estate data and analytics covering over one million properties representing more than $45 trillion in transactions and portfolio assets in over 170 countries. The acquisition of Burgiss will provide MSCI with comprehensive data and deep expertise in all private assets, enabling investors to evaluate fundamental information, measure and compare performance, understand exposures, manage risk, and conduct robust analytics. MSCI will also enable investors to compare performance and risk across both private and public asset classes, which will facilitate more efficient asset allocations.

 
This acquisition will also expand MSCI’s robust suite of multi-asset class technology solutions with the industry leading Burgiss Caissa Platform, developed exclusively for institutional investors and providing a comprehensive view of the drivers of performance and risk in both public and private investments in total portfolios.

 
Henry Fernandez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, MSCI, said: “The acquisition of Burgiss marks a transformational milestone for MSCI and reinforces our commitment to driving innovation and transparency across the global private asset investment landscape. By combining Burgiss' comprehensive private asset data and analytics with MSCI’s expertise in research, analytics, data and technology for investments across public asset classes, we are aiming to redefine total portfolio investing and build solutions that can help investors manage their complex portfolios and make better informed decisions.

 
“Burgiss will help us expand one of our key strategic growth opportunities and generate substantial value for our shareholders over time. I am confident that our pre-existing partnership with Burgiss will support our successful integration of this new business,” he added.

 
Jim Kocis, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Burgiss, commented: “The combination with MSCI marks a significant landmark event in Burgiss’ journey. In this next phase, our combined capabilities are poised to create even more powerful solutions that can help better navigate and drive innovation across private assets.”

 
MSCI anticipates funding the purchase consideration from existing liquidity sources. Burgiss is expected to generate over $90 million of revenue in 2023 with an EBITDA margin and operating income margin in the mid-teens. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Burgiss’ financial results will be presented as part of MSCI’s All Other – Private Assets reportable segment.

 
MSCI's senior management will host a conference call to review this transaction on Monday, August 14, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
