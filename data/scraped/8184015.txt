The investigation concerns whether Avid and its board of directors violated the federal securities laws and/or breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by failing to, among other things: (1) obtain the best possible consideration for Avid shareholders; (2) determine whether STG is underpaying for Avid; and (3) disclose all material information necessary for Avid shareholders to adequately assess and value the merger consideration. On behalf of Avid shareholders, Halper Sadeh LLC may seek increased consideration for shareholders, additional disclosures and information concerning the proposed transaction, or other relief and benefits.
