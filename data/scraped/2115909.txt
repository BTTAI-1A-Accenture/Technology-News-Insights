An all-star cast of screen industry heavyweights are heading west to inspire and educate the next generation of Australian filmmakers. The producer of hit TV satire South Park, Debbie Liebling, and the director of Australian film The Dry, Robert Connolly, are among those travelling to the CinefestOZ film festival this month. They will be joined in WA by Alison Hurbert-Burns from Binge, Katherine Brown from Stan and Daniel Schultz from Ludo Studios, which produces the global hit Bluey, as they share their expert knowledge. "Our guests have all achieved significant success within the screen industry and we are fortunate that they are available to share their time and knowledge as part of our program," CinefestOZ chief executive Cassandra Jordan said. "The Industry Program also provides interstate and international delegates the opportunity to meet our local filmmakers and scope the destination for potential future film locations and productions." A two-day program including presentations, panel talks and workshops will focus on learning from experiences and projects of respected industry leaders. Ms Liebling is an influential producer and studio executive who helped create hit films like Bridesmaids, Pitch Perfect and TED. In addition to helping develop South Park, she is also a former president of production at Universal Pictures. Mr Connolly is one of Australia's most acclaimed and best-known filmmakers with an international career spanning 30 years. His films also include the box office hit Paper Planes with Sam Worthington, Balibo starring Oscar Isaac and Anthony LaPaglia and The Turning with Cate Blanchett and Rose Byrne. He also directed the Emmy-nominated book adaptation The Slap. More than a dozen studio producers and executives will also attend to work with about 100 film industry delegates. The 16th annual CinefestOZ Film Festival runs from August 29 to September 3 in Busselton.
