FOOTBALL fans hilariously claimed Erling Haaland suffered a "software glitch" as Manchester City booked their place in the Champions League semi-finals. Pep Guardiola's side drew 1-1 with Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday evening, clinching a 4-1 aggregate victory. And Haaland, who missed a first-half penalty, helped himself to his 48th goal of the season after the break following Dayot Upamecano's crucial slip. But the pair were involved in an incident earlier on in the game when Haaland was brought down by the French defender as he went through on goal. Upamecano was shown a red card by Clement Turpin for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. However, the offside flag then went up - a decision which was confirmed by VAR. And Turpin then wiped out Upamecano's dismissal as his blushes were temporarily spared. But before the red card had been rescinded, the cameras caught Haaland celebrating in a rather bizarre manner. He swiftly pumped his fist in an aggressive way while rapidly turning his head. And fans jokingly claimed Haaland - who has often been compared to a robot for his freakish goalscoring ability - had suffered a "glitch".

Update required ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜­." And a fourth responded: "Hahaha downloaded software updates mid-game." Haaland's 48 goals in 41 games could fire Man City to a treble this season. They sit four points behind Arsenal in the Premier League table, but have a game in hand and face the Gunners at the Etihad on Wednesday. In the Champions League, they will face holders Real Madrid in the semi-finals. But before that they take on Championship side Sheffield United in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley on Saturday.
