 Related Stories Ramp, a New York City financial tech company, is the No. 1 buzziest startup by growth and demand, according to LinkedIn's latest report on the top startups in the U.S. Liquid Death jumped to the No. 2 top startup of the year from No. 25 last year, in part after leveraging a cameo from drummer Travis Barker in an ad campaign. And rounding out the top 3 is Whatnot, the livestream shopping platform currently hiring several six-figures roles across product and security functions. LinkedIn's latest report recognizes the 50 young U.S companies growing quickly based on four factors: employment growth (percentage of headcount increase), engagement (how many non-employees are viewing the startup on LinkedIn), job interest (the rate at which people are viewing and applying to jobs there) and attraction of top talent (how many employees the startup has recruited away from LinkedIn Top Companies). Retailers, health startups and tech companies leveraging artificial intelligence dominate the list. Overall, nearly one-third, 30%, of this year's top startups were founded in 2020, and many address gaps that the pandemic revealed, such as access to mental health resources and other forms of health care. Many of the early-stage businesses are hiring for roles in engineering, product and design, analytics, sales and marketing, operations, customer service and security — many of which command six-figure salaries. Remote roles make up more than half of the available jobs at the top startups, says Dan Roth, LinkedIn's editor in chief.
