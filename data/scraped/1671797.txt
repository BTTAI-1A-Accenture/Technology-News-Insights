Fan-favorite Boston Celtics big man Tacko Fall’s journey to the U.S. and the NBA is a riveting tale. The Senegalese center nearly had his basketball career end before it started thanks to unscrupulous handlers. Fall recently made a guest appearance on Jeff Teague’s “Club 520” podcast. He talked about his first impressions of the United States at the age of 16, noting the size and scale of everything from the cars to the sports to the expectations some had for him on the basketball court. He reflects on his initial struggles and homesickness but highlights how his move to Florida for high school marked a turning point in his basketball development. To hear about his time on the AAU circuit and how he eventually committed to playing college basketball for the University of Central Florida (UCF) in the lead-up to joining the Celtics after going undrafted, check out the clip embedded below.
