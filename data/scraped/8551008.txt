The Knicks jumped out to a 12-4 lead over the Cavaliers to open Game 2 — and that’s about as good it went for them on Tuesday night. They’ll head back to New York with a series split, but any potentially lingering momentum from the opener dissipated on the heels of a 107-90 loss. It’s not that the Knicks had no answers for Darius Garland, who posted a game-high 32 points, it’s that they didn’t have any answers at all. They struggled from deep, hitting just seven of their 29 three-point attempts and making just 29 of their 79s shot on the night. Josh Hart, the Game 1 hero, didn’t appear hobbled by the sprained ankle he sustained in the opener, but scored just five points and was an abysmal -29 in 26:47 off the bench. Things were marginally better for the likes of Jalen Brunson — who scored 20 on 5 of 17 shooting, despite being 1 of 8 beyond the arc — and Julius Randle, who struggled to find consistency in a 22-point effort. The Knicks will have a few days to figure out where it all went wrong before they return to action for Game 3 at the Garden on Friday.
