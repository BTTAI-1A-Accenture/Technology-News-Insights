The sector ended the year with record gains, soaring 58% as of December 30, compared with a roughly 20% decline in the S&P 500. According to Dow Jones Market Data, this was the first time ever for the energy sector to emerge as a solo winner of the S&P 500 calendar year. Moreover, it was the benchmark’s only sector that did not decline during the year. One of the main factors that contributed to the solid performance of the energy sector last year was the rising oil and gas prices. Analysts are expecting the trend to continue this year as well. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York, talked to Fox Business about the energy industry’s outlook for 2023. He asserted that many geo-political tensions could still keep the oil and gas prices elevated this year. He further mentioned that though fluctuating market conditions could not reveal a clear picture, the energy sector is still in a good shape amid a slow global economy. The outperformance of the energy industry is driving investors toward the sector as energy companies have steadily raised their dividends over the last 12 months, as reported by Wall Street Journal. The report also mentioned that these payouts would still hold an effect even if the economy enters a recession. In addition to this, investors also tend to focus on companies that have strong free cash flow generation. According to a report by Fidelity, free cash flow yields in the energy industry were at their all-time high relative to the broader market at the end of 2022. Moreover, many energy companies have significantly reduced their debts over the past two years and are now returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), and Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) are some popular energy companies that pay dividends to shareholders.
