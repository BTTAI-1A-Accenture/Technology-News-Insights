 T-Swift was serving some serious spring fashion inspo this week, and now we NEED to upgrade our closets. 🦋👖 If you buy something from the links on this page, we may earn a commission. Why Trust Us? Taylor Swift has long been a fashion icon, but considering how good all of her Eras Tour outfits have been lately, we don't blame the internet for freaking out over her latest look: a chic pair of light-wash jeans with a crystal-crusted butterfly cutout on the thigh. The jeans in question are nearly $700 and are already sold out, though, and that's where we come in! We scoured the internet to bring you some Y2K-inspired butterfly-bedecked jeans, including a more affordable version of the butterfly cutout jeans, a similar pair from the makers of Tay’s sold-out jeans, and a couple of other light-wash jeans with butterfly detailing. If you’re wondering why Taylor’s butterfly jeans are so buzzy right now, it’s probably because of two things: 1) they’re super cute and on-trend, and 2) she and her longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn recently broke up, which has many media outlets speculating that these jeans with their butterfly motif might signify her “rebirth” post-breakup, since that’s what butterflies typically symbolize (you know, metamorphosis and all). Luckily, you have plenty of options to shop if the Midnights singer now has you convinced that you NEED a pair of butterfly jeans. Not to mention, all of these jeans will make for a super-cute springtime addition to your — and/or your favorite Swiftie's — wardrobe.  Like Taylor Swift herself, ripped jeans never go out of style. This baggy pair from Amazon incorporates rips and some distressed detailing along the front of the jeans, along with butterflies and drawings of sparkles to bring a feminine element to this otherwise edgy, Y2K-inspired pair.  For a seriously similar version of the jeans Taylor was spotted wearing earlier this week, add this pair to cart. Not only are they way more affordable than her pair, but these also have a loose fit, are a light wash, and have a sparkly butterfly cutout. If you want these, we’d recommend fluttering to them quick! Cutouts not your style? No worries. Try this boho, light-wash pair with butterfly patches stitched onto the right ankle and up on the side of the left thigh instead. And even better, you can get these for 30% off right now. For a subtle rendition, go for these light-wash boyfriend jeans. There are white butterflies stamped all over them for a super-cute spring print you can dress up or down. Not to mention, you can snag these for 30% off! We hear you — these aren’t butterfly jeans. But they are from the same company that made Taylor’s now-famous butterfly cutout pair, and these also have a cutout on the thigh. And better yet, these aren’t sold out (at least, not yet).  Plus, the flower has gold mussel shells acting as flower petals, making them totally appropriate for both spring and summer.
