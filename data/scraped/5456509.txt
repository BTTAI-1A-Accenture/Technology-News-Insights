 Where will free agent running back Dalvin Cook land? The oddsmakers view three teams as the clear favorites. The New England Patriots (+150) are the most likely team to sign Cook, according to DraftKings Sportsbook. The teams with the next-best odds are the Miami Dolphins (+200) and New York Jets (+400). After that, three teams — the Washington Commanders, Denver Broncos and Dallas Cowboys — are tied with the fourth-best odds (+1500). Here’s a look at the ten teams with the best odds to sign Cook, via DraftKings: Patriots: +150
Dolphins +200
Jets: +400
Commanders: +1500
Broncos: +1500
Cowboys: +1500
Giants: +1800
Raiders: +1800
Bills: +1800
Bears: +2000 Based on those odds, it seems that Las Vegas views the Patriots, Dolphins and Jets as the clear favorites to sign the veteran running back. The Broncos are part of the conversation, but they don’t appear to be true contenders. With Javonte Williams working his way back from a knee injury, Denver’s top fallback option at running back is Samaje Perine. With limited salary cap space available, the Broncos might be content to go into the season with Williams and Perine as their top two RBs.
