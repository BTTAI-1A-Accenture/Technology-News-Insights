The Magpies previously confirmed the duo had been offered new deals, and the announcement was made on social media on Sunday afternoon. Newcastle's first-team squad reported for their first day of pre-season on Sunday, with their first friendly against Gateshead FC less than a week later. News of the contract extension was released with a picture of head coach Eddie Howe standing besides both players at the club's training ground. It is the second extension Karius has agreed since signing an initial short-term deal on Tyneside last September. The former Liverpool number one's appearance in the Carabao Cup final defeat to Manchester United is still the 30-year-old's only appearance for the club to date. Karius' new deal follows Newcastle's decision to trigger an extension in Mark Gillespie's contract, meaning the club currently have five senior goalkeepers on their books. The recent announcement will cast further doubt over the futures of both Martin Dubravka and Karl Darlow, with the latter said to be interesting a number of Championship sides.
