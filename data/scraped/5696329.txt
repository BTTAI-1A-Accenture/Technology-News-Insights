					Covering the business and politics of space				 TAMPA, Fla. — CAES Space Systems, a supplier of radiation-hardened electronics, rebranded as Frontgrade Technologies Jan. 10 after being sold to private equity firm Veritas Capital.





Veritas announced plans to buy the company in October for an undisclosed sum from CAES, the former electronics unit of British defense and aerospace contractor Cobham.





Frontgrade comprises all the space-related assets that were part of CAES, which continues to serve a mix of other commercial and defense markets. 





Advent International, the private equity firm that recently announced $6.4 billion plans to buy satellite maker and imagery provider Maxar Technologies, bought CAES in 2020 for about $5 billion.





Both Maxar and Frontgrade are based in Colorado.





Veritas sees opportunities to expand Frontgrade’s business in the U.S. national security market as a standalone company.


Recent programs in Frontgrade’s more than 60 years of flight heritage include Dubai’s Rashid Rover, which is on its way to the moon as part of the HAKUTO-R lunar exploration program.





Frontgrade provided a microprocessor that will be used to control four cameras onboard the Rashid Rover after it reaches the lunar surface.





The company also provides electronic solutions for defense, healthcare, and industrial applications.
