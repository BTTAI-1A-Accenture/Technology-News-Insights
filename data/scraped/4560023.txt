In a large bowl, beat the eggs for about 3 minutes. Gradually add sugar, then beat for 2 minutes or until mixture becomes thick and lemon colored. Beat in pumpkin and vanilla. Combine flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl; fold into pumpkin mixture. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Bake at 375 for 10-15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched, being careful not to over bake. Cool for 5 minutes. Turn pan upside down onto a linen kitchen towel dusted with 1 Tablespoon of powdered sugar. Peel off waxed paper. Roll up cake in the towel, starting with one of the short sides. Cool completely, seam side down. To make filling: In a small bowl, mix cream cheese, margarine or butter, the Cup of powdered sugar and vanilla until light and fluffy. Unroll cooled cake: spread filling evenly over cake until about 1/2 inch from the edges. Roll up again, putting the end seam at the bottom.  Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. I serve this with a little whipped cream that I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to. Makes about 12 slices.
