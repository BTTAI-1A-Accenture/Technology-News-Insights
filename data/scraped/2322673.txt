FOLLOW DEVELOPING TELECOMS  Cloudera, a data company with a focus on enterprise AI, has announced a collaboration with a leading Indian fintech platform, PhonePe. PhonePe has selected the Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) to achieve greater operational efficiencies and for higher scalability, agility, flexibility, and reliability. CDP will help PhonePe to shift some of its workloads to the cloud, with the rest of the workloads remaining on-premises. As a growing fintech company, one of PhonePe’s key business requirements is managing the scale of its data cluster on a monolithic infrastructure. For this, PhonePe needs to transition to a hybrid data platform. Cloudera introduced CDP as a way of offering a unified data solution that, it says, seamlessly integrates data management and analytics on-premises and in cloud environments. Cloudera’s shared data experience (SDX) feature will ensure that the CDP is secured by design and will further enable PhonePe to access the data irrespective of its location, without compromise. Cloudera says CDP’s flexibility will empower PhonePe to achieve its various business needs through flexible workload migration. It will also give the company an enhanced layer of support by helping PhonePe in a seamless transition to use of CDP and related subscription-based support services, allowing PhonePe to focus more on continued innovation of its data architecture. Mayank Baid, Regional Vice President, India, Cloudera explains: “Our hybrid data platform includes an observability solution that offers maximum workload visibility, enables predictability of the workloads, and further minimises the operational overheads.”
