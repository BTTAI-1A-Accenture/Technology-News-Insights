Android Headlines / Tech News / Audio / RedMagic intros see-through earbuds with global availability RedMagic has introduced its very own see-through earbuds which will be available to purchase globally. These earbuds are called the RedMagic Cyberbuds DAO truly wireless earbuds. Many of you will immediately make a comparison to Nothing’s earbuds, mainly due to the see-through design. Well, RedMagic is well-known for releasing gaming smartphones, and it tends to offer phones with see-through backplates. So… this is right in the company’s wheelhouse. In any case, these earbuds have a cylindric-shaped stem, and the stem is see-through, not the rest of the earbuds. The case has a transparent top too, and it looks quite interesting. The earbuds themselves come with RGB effects, and Qualcomm’s latest S5 chip. Bluetooth 5.3 is supported here, while the Cyberbuds DAO earbuds deliver a minimal 28ms delay when used with the matching dongle. You can also use the Goper application in order to manage various other functions of these earbuds. You can mess around with codec formats, audio EQ modes, game modes, lighting effects, and more. RedMagic used wool paper/LCP film for diaphragm material here. Copper-clad aluminum has been used for the voice coil, while the earbuds offer active noise cancellation up to 48dB. Each of the earbuds has a battery capacity of 35mAh, while the charging case includes a 350mAh battery. That case also has a Type-C port on it, for charging purposes. The company says it’ll take you about 40 minutes to charge the earbuds fully. The case, on the other hand, can be charged to 100% in 50 minutes. The case does support wireless charging as well, though it’s noticeably slower than wired charging. The RedMagic Cyberbuds DAO earphones support AAC, SBC, LE Audio, LHDC 5.0, and aptX codecs. They also include touch strips on them, for touch controls, and function buttons are also a part of the offering. You will also find a knob button on the case itself. RedMagic’s latest earbuds are priced at €229 ($251), and will be available to purchase starting tomorrow, August 2. You’ll be able to get them from redmagic.gg and some retailers in Europe, the UK; Singapore, and Mexico. They’re coming to Mexico in September, though. Copyright ©2023 Android Headlines.
