Seahawks.com Senior Reporter The Seahawks came out of Friday night's mock game at Lumen Field getting a lot of work in, in front of an enthusiastic crowd, but there were also a couple of injuries coming out of the scrimmage. Rookie running back Kenny McIntoshï»¿, who has been one of the bright spots early in camp, "sprained his knee somewhat," Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. The injury happened when McIntosh was pulled down awkwardly on a tackle, and while he walked off under his own power, he was checked out by athletic trainers and finished his evening with an ice pack on his knee. Undrafted rookie Andrew Whitaker also left with a knee injury, and in both cases the severity will not be known until more tests can be done. "We'll see how those guys come out of the tests when we check them out tomorrow," Carroll said. Tyler Lockett didn't participate in the mock game, but Carroll said there isn't any real injury concern with the veteran receiver. "He's OK," Carroll said. "He just has a little bit of tightness in something, and we just wanted to make sure to take him. He's doing great, he has had a great camp so far. He's has as good a camp as we've seen in the last, I don't know, five or six years or something like that. He's in great shape and all of that, and we just want to keep him on that trajectory. He's doing great." Asked a follow-up about Lockett, Carroll reiterated, "He's OK, he's fine, we wanted to give him a break." Receiver Dareke Young also didn't participate Friday, and his status is not yet clear going forward. "We're working on that one to figure that one out," Carroll said. "He's got a little something going on in his groin, hip kind of stuff, so that's kind of that sports hernia area that we're looking at to make sure we diagnose it well and take care of him. Right now, we don't have a decisive plan whether he needs any work. Right now, we're going to rest him and see if he can bounce back." Running back ï»¿Zach Charbonnetï»¿, who returned to practice Thursday after missing a few days with a shoulder injury, took part in warmups but did not take part in the scrimmage portion of the practice. Carroll said the rookie will be a full-go when the team returns to work Sunday. In other running back injury news, Carroll said ï»¿Kenneth Walker IIIï»¿, who has been out with a groin injury, "is not going to be out for a long time. He's going to be OK." Carroll also said running back ï»¿DeeJay Dallasï»¿ had a sore ankle after getting tripped in practice Friday, but he was able to participate in the mock game, albeit with a limited work load.
