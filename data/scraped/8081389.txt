Summary Pfizer Inc. (PFE) receives CDC endorsement for its maternal RSV vaccine, Abrysvo, with a potential revenue of $2 billion, marking a pivotal advancement in healthcare and highlighting Pfizers commitment to innovation and public health.   Introduction New York, NY  In a groundbreaking development in the world of healthcare, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) recently received a significant nod from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for its maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, Abrysvo.    This milestone approval has sent ripples of excitement through the pharmaceutical industry, as it offers the promise of safeguarding infants from a leading cause of hospitalization. Daniel Leitner, an expert from HalderBay, has explained the news and its possible impact on Pfizer shares.   In an 11-to-1 vote, the CDC advisory committee endorsed the seasonal administration of Pfizers maternal RSV vaccine to pregnant individuals during the 32nd to 36th weeks of gestation. This crucial recommendation, ratified by CDC director Dr. Mandy Cohen, underscores the urgency and significance of this preventative measure.   RSV, which affects the respiratory system, poses a considerable threat to infants and older adults. The virus is responsible for hospitalizing a substantial number of children under the age of 5 each year, ranging from 58,000 to 80,000 cases, as reported by the CDC. Among those at a higher risk are premature infants and children with compromised immune systems.   The maternal vaccine, Abrysvo, represents a groundbreaking step in the fight against RSV. Having secured the approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just last month, Abrysvo is engineered to provide infants with protection during the crucial first six months of life. Dr. Luis Jodar, Pfizers Chief Medical Officer for Vaccines Medical Development, hailed the CDC committees recommendation as a testament to the transformative potential of vaccines. He stated, The committees recommendation reinforces the wide-ranging impact vaccines can have, including helping protect infants immediately at birth from the potentially severe and life-threatening complications that can develop from RSV. Pfizers Abrysvo comes with a price of $295 per dose, positioning it as a valuable tool in the arsenal against RSV.   Previously, the CDC had suggested nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody developed jointly by AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) and Sanofi (SNY), for infants under eight months of age entering their first RSV season. However, Pfizers Abrysvo now offers a compelling alternative.   In most cases, babies typically require protection from either the monoclonal antibody or the maternal vaccine, but not both, according to the CDC. Nonetheless, there may be situations where nirsevimab is preferred, especially for infants born within 15 days after maternal immunization.   A spokesperson for Sanofi pointed out that nirsevimab, marketed as Beyfortus, remains the sole choice for infants born outside of the RSV season. It provides protection directly to infants, extending through 5 months, and continues to be recognized for its clinical efficacy and safety.   Pfizers Abrysvo, in addition to its role in maternal immunization, was earlier approved for safeguarding older adults from RSV. The company envisions peak revenues of approximately $2 billion stemming from Abrysvos applications across both demographics. This development underscores Pfizers commitment to public health and its dedication to creating innovative solutions that address critical healthcare challenges.
