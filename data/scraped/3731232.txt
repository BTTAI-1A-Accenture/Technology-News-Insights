Thanks to Microsoft's US$10 billion investment in OpenAI, it's safe to say that the investment is paying off as ChatGPT is slowly becoming a household name for maximising efficiency and making once impossible tasks possible. Suppose you're keen to get on the AI bandwagon but don't want to participate in the overcrowded trade of buying into Microsoft. In that case, don't fret -- our guide to investing in artificial intelligence stocks besides Microsoft will inform you about alternative top AI companies that rival the ChatGPT giant. From the up-and-coming Google Bard to foreign competitors like Alibaba, here are our picks for the biggest and best AI stocks to add to your artificial intelligence stocks watchlist. As initially coined by Stanford Professor John McCarthy in 1955, Artificial Intelligence is defined as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. This is done with the eventual goal of getting devices to perform complex and cognitive tasks. Contrary to popular belief, the world's fascination with artificial intelligence dates back to 1950 with the introduction of the Turing test and Alan Turing's famous "Can Machines think?" question. Such introspection helped shape the foundations of artificial intelligence and its philosophy. Fast forward to today, and we once again see artificial intelligence take centre stage in the rapidly progressing world of technology. This is thanks to OpenAI's public showings of its AI technology that showcase the prowess of machine learning. These include dominating human opponents in DOTA 2 in 2017 and releasing ChatGPT to the public in 2022. Now that we know how AI came to be let's move on to understand its importance in today's tech industry. According to an industry analysis report by Grand View Research, the global AI market size is expected to reach US$733.7 billion by 2027, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. Given OpenAI's established lead in the sector, it's likely that Microsoft is the crowd favourite for pocketing the lion's share of the growth. However, investors may want to take note of the dangers when participating in a crowded trade. For example, if OpenAI revealed that its learned language model is flawed during a public demonstration like what happened with Google's Bard, it could lead to a significant dip in share prices as everyone rushes to exit their positions. Ultimately, it's why investors are always encouraged to stay diversified, especially in an emerging sector full of unknowns. Fortunately, for those keen on investing in artificial intelligence, plenty of other big names in the AI sector could be just as lucrative. Here are some of the top AI companies ranked according to their market capitalisation as of 7th August 2023.
