 As of the second quarter of 2023, Apple TV+ had 6% of the U.S. streaming services market, according to JustWatch, an international streaming guide. That’s the same as it had in the first quarter.
                   Prime Video continues to hold down the streaming crown in the U.S. with a 1% lead over global giant, Netflix. They have 21% and 20% market share, respectively. The newly rebranded Max (formerly HBO Max) has 15% market share. Disney+ has 13%. Hulu has 11% and Paramount has 7%.
