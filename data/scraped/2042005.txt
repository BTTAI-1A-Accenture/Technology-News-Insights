An Instagram post on Miss Ukraine’s page said: “The “Warrior of Light” costume symbolizes our nation’s fight against darkness. Like Archangel Michael, who defends Ukraine with a sword, it protects us. “Viktoriia has a weapon in her hands, her body is covered in armour, and simultaneously, she carries light through the darkness that came to our peaceful lands with the aggressor.” It added: “The monolithic jumpsuit symbolises armour and wraps Victoria like a second skin. “The white dress consists of a stylization of a vyshyvanka with puffy sleeves and a skirt with more than 10 meters of fabric. “The headwear is decorated with spikelets, which are traditional in Ukraine. “Symbolic wings are burned in battle, framed in blue and gold armor in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, and decorated with various mirror ornaments, opened for the decisive action. “The costume was created in Ukraine in four months in extreme conditions, to the sound of sirens, without electricity, and by candlelight.”     A post shared by МІС УКРАЇНА ВСЕСВІТ (@missukraine_universe)  New York Senator Wants Casinos To Be Licensed In 2023 Value And Benefits Of The Sports Industry Can Be Fun For Everyone
