As fire officials say the kind of fires they fight today bring unique challenges, firefighters were given free health screenings Saturday in Albany. [anvplayer video=”5152196″ station=”998132″] Providers were screening for a number of cancers including: bladder, kidney, prostate, and thyroid, thanks to Saint Peter’s Health Partners. Many chemicals that firefighters encounter are known or suspected to cause cancer – which the CDC says is a leading cause of death among firefighters. The station representative that can assist any person with disabilities with issues related to the content of the public file is Brittany Moroukian. She can be contacted at bmoroukian@wnyt.com or 518-207-4761. This website is not intended for users located within the European Economic Area.
