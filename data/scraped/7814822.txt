 Whether business owners and entrepreneurs own a big grocery store, a small neighborhood convenience store, or an entire chain of stores, commercial freezers serve as vital elements in presenting and serving products to their customers. According to industry leader Ancaster Food Equipment, efficient freezers are critical to success and keep customers coming back knowing they can trust businesses to sell quality food. This is where Ancaster Food Equipment comes into the picture. Anchored on the understanding that product customization is the key to serving a diverse customer base, the company offers a wide range of unique requirements that its clients need.  For example, upright glass door display freezers are some of the most popular products in Ancaster's lineup of commercial freezers. An excellent choice for grocery stores, pet stores, convenience stores, and ice cream shops, these commercial freezers brilliantly and dependably display the products to increase impulse purchases.  Meanwhile, stainless steel door commercial freezers are an excellent choice for businesses that need to store goods out of customers' view or for storage in back-of-house applications. These commercial restaurant freezers are commonly used in kitchens and retail storage locations. Ancaster also offers a variety of ice cream freezers available in various brands and sizes. These ice cream freezers are designed for full-service establishments. The most popular freezer models hold six, eight, or ten tubs of ice cream, but the company can help clients find smaller or larger models depending on their needs. An industry leader for decades, Ancaster Food Equipment has spent so much time mastering the art of refurbishing commercial refrigerators, display coolers and restaurant freezers. Starting from humble beginnings to a 40,000-square-foot warehouse, its team of experts understands the importance of reliable and affordable commercial refrigeration solutions to meet its customers' needs. The company also offers a lineup of portable sinks with hot water that have become increasingly popular in recent years. Ancaster Food Equipment offers the same warranty that customers would receive if they buy a new cooler or freezer elsewhere. Every refurbished unit comes with a standard seven-year warranty on the new compressor and a two-year warranty on all the parts and services. Ultimately, what Ancaster Food Equipment offers its customers is a high-quality product, fully refurbished to ensure it is in perfect working order, upgraded to their specifications, and warrantied to match the original equipment manufacturer (OEM.)
