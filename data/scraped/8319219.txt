The FOS released data for the first half of 2023, which also highlighted a surge in building and motor insurance complaints, reaching a five-year high. This was partly attributed to insurers' delays in settling claims. Complaints regarding mortgages and home finance also saw a slight increase compared to the last six months of 2022. Customers who are unable to reach a resolution with their financial firms can escalate their complaints to the ombudsman service. In total, the FOS received 93,114 complaints between January 1 and June 30, 2023, marking an increase from the 79,921 complaints lodged in the last six months of 2022.
