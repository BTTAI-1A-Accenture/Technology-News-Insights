The incident allegedly took place on flight number AA292, which took off from New York at 9.16 pm on Friday and landed after 14 hours and 26 minutes of flying at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport here at 10.12 pm on Saturday. Who is the accused? The accused is a student in a US university. He was in a state of inebriation and urinated while he was asleep.
