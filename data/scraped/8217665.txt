The RTÉ Archives is a treasure representing the Ireland of a different era. There is much to enjoy in it, including this film of an interview with a postman looks back on his 30 years of service in the Moate area. See the video on the RTÉ website here. The following is from the RTÉ website: For 30 years Billy Power cycled the roads, delivering post to homes in the Moate area. Every day he left Moate post office at 8.30am on route for Mount Temple, and returned to Moate seven hours later. Of all the years cycling a bicycle, the only problem Billy ever encountered on his route was the occasional dog who tried to bite him. A confirmed bachelor, he joked that he never married because, “I was probably more afraid of women than dogs”. Billy never felt the need for a wife and was well able to look after himself. Looking back over his lengthy career, he would do it all again and would not change a thing. With a parting shot to the chairman of An Post, Billy handed over his hat and mailbag, “You can give that to Feargal Quinn with my compliments.” This episode of ‘Evening Extra’ was broadcast on January 27, 1988. The reporter is Shay Healy.
