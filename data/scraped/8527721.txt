 There are many considerations to take into account when choosing an online bookkeeping service. These include: Forbes Advisor analyzed 13 online bookkeeping services and considered 15 metrics such as price, features, customer service, ease of use, integrations and service level. We also looked at real customer experiences to determine if their expectations were met based on what each company promised. After assigning a weighted score to each category, we formulated rankings for each company. For pricing, we considered whether a service offers a free trial or a free version of its software as well as the affordability of its lowest and highest price tiers. Those that had pricing that we considered to be in the affordable or moderate range fared better in our rankings while companies that offer upfront pricing received higher ratings than those that did not disclose it immediately. Pricing accounted for 10% of our weighted scoring. We broke features down into two separate categories: general features and additional features. For general features, we considered these to be elements that the software should offer and we weighted them by whether they were part of the paid plan or were available as an add-on. These general features include providing a dedicated bookkeeper, offering bank reconciliation and offering tools, such as invoicing, payroll, bill pay and financial statements. For additional features, these were elements that fell into the “nice-to-have” category that not all software providers offered, either as part of their regular plan or as a paid add-on. These included offering mobile apps and software integrations. Both kinds of features combined to account for 60% of our total score. Based on our market research and customer reviews on popular third-party review sites, we also ranked additional criteria, such as ease of use, detailed or standout features, popularity and value for the price, ranking these on a graded scale from excellent to terrible. Together, these criteria make up 30% of the total score. If you want your business to save time and money, then you should consider hiring a bookkeeping service. A bookkeeping service can help you stay organized and on top of your finances. A small business can likely do all its own bookkeeping using accounting software. Many of the operations are automated in the software, making it easy to get accurate debits and credits entered. The cost of bookkeeping services can vary depending on the size of your business and the features you need. Some bookkeeping services charge a monthly fee while others charge by the hour. You can find services for as little as $20 per month while others run thousands per month. Bookkeeping is an essential part of running a small business. Even if you aren’t planning on growing any time soon, you need to have a sense of how much money is coming in vs. what is going out. On top of that, you need the data used in bookkeeping to file your taxes accurately. Some bookkeeping services can provide a full suite of bookkeeping, accounting and tax services. Others may only offer bookkeeping services. Examples include bookkeeping journal entries, bookkeeping ledger, bookkeeping reconciliation and bookkeeping trial balance. The main difference between bookkeeping and accounting is that bookkeeping focuses on recording financial transactions while accounting focuses on interpreting, classifying and reporting those transactions.
