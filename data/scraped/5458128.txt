Ohio experienced 20 healthcare data breaches in 2022NSL CLEVELAND, Ohio - Ohio experienced 20 healthcare data breaches in 2022, which affected more than 275,000 Ohioans, according to an analysis by Drata of Department of Health and Human Services data. Healthcare organizations are among the most targeted businesses for data due to how much sensitive patient information is available. Hospitals, home health agencies, and other institutions store patients’ phone numbers, Social Security numbers, addresses, and other data that a hacker could use to pose as a patient and open new credit cards or bank accounts in their name. Sometimes a single cyberattack can impact hospitals across multiple states, like when hackers targeted CommonSpirit Health in October 2022. Often, patient information is served up to a worldwide market to steal someone else’s identity. In 2022, roughly 44% of all reported identity theft was due to fraudulent credit card accounts being opened, according to Federal Trade Commission. In either case, The HITECH Act, signed into federal law in 2009, requires companies to report breaches of protected health information affecting 500 or more people to HHS. Most data breaches at healthcare companies happen through hacking and IT incidents, including in Ohio.
