Each four-golfer group will compete in a round-robin format over the first three days before the group winners advance to the knockout phase for the final two days of action. Scheffler, the World No. 1, is the 7-1 favorite in the latest 2023 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play odds at Caesars Sportsbook. He is expected to advance from a group that includes Tom Kim, Alex Noren and Davis Riley. The first WGC-Match Play tee times come at 10:20 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Jon Rahm (10-1) and Rory McIlroy (12-1) are both expected to be 2023 WGC-Dell Technologies contenders this week. McIlroy is facing Keegan Bradley, Denny McCarthy and Scott Stallings in his group in the 2023 WGC-Dell Technologies field. Before locking in your 2023 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine. SportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up over $8,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament. McClure's model predicted Jon Rahm to finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions, the American Express and the Genesis Invitational. The model also included J.T. Poston in its best bets to win the 2022 John Deere Classic. That bet hit at +5500, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned almost $1,100. At the 2022 Masters, McClure's model was all over Scottie Scheffler's first career major championship victory heading into the weekend. In addition, McClure's best bets included Collin Morikawa winning outright at the 2021 Open Championship, even though he was listed as a massive 40-1 longshot. The model was also all over Rahm's (10-1) first career major championship victory at the 2021 U.S. Open. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the weekend, but the model still projected him as the winner. This same model has also nailed a whopping eight majors entering the weekend. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns. Now that the 2023 WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play field is locked, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard. One major surprise the model is calling for at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play 2023: McIlroy, a 23-time PGA Tour champion and one of the top favorites, wins his group but isn't a solid value to win it all. McIlroy opened his 2022-23 season with a victory at the CJ Cup in October, but he's struggled mightily in recent weeks.  In fact, McIlroy has finished T-29 or worse in three of his last four starts on the PGA Tour, which includes a missed cut at the Players Championship earlier this month. He's also struggled at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play in recent years, finishing T-28 or worse in three of his last four starts at this event. McIlroy enters this week's event ranked 139th in greens in regulation percentage (64.81%), 140th in putting average (1.776) and 173rd in strokes gained: putting (-.429). He's not a strong pick to win it all and there are far better values to win it all in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play 2023 field. Another surprise: Tony Finau, a 22-1 longshot, wins his group and then makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. Finau should be able to advance out of a group that includes Kurt Kitayama, Adrian Meronk and Christiaan Bezuidenhout, which will set him up to make a charge this weekend. He missed the cut at the World Wide Technology Championship at Mayakoba, but he has finished in the top 25 in every tournament since then. Finau won the Cadence Bank Houston Open and came in ninth place at the Farmers Insurance Open. He ranks inside the top 10 on the PGA Tour in scoring average and birdie average, making him a solid wagering option at Austin Country Club. See who else to pick here.  The model is also targeting several surprising group winners who will then go on to compete for the title, including a pair of longshots higher than 20-1. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's PGA picks here. So who will win the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play 2023? And which longshots stun the golfing world?
