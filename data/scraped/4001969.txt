The city said this will bring 30 jobs to the city. The Economic Development Corp. in Broken Arrow said this move should bring in $13.9 million in economic impact. The city announced Thursday that Alfa Laval is moving its manufacturing of air-cooled heat exchangers to its existing plant in Broken Arrow. Jennifer Conway with the Broken Arrow Economic Development Corporation said well-paying jobs like this help fuel the city. "Well you can't build a strong community if no one has a good paying job, and as an economic developer we believe that is the foundation for a strong community," she said. She said Broken Arrow is the perfect spot to provide Alfa Laval's machinery throughout the country. "Oklahoma has proven time and time again that it's a great location, because of our central location, we can get to Texas and the ports, but you can also go all around the United States," she said. She said there are 300 manufacturers in Broken Arrow, and this area provides a qualified work force that companies like Alfa Laval need. "It's incredibly important to work hard to take care of your businesses, giving them the resources to grow, to attract them here, and Alfa Laval is that perfect story," she said. Conway said there will be other announcements soon including Alfa Laval and other manufacturers.
