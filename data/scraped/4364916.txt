Japan's National Daily Since 1922 March 29, 2023 (Mainichi Japan) Japanese version 
    IWAKURA, Aichi -- Visitors to one of Japan's top cherry blossom-viewing spots in this central Japan city were treated to a dual spectacle as an annual washing of "koinobori" carp streamers took place here on March 28.
 
    The carp streamers were being prepared for use ahead of Children's Day, a national holiday on May 5. Work begins during winter, and washing glue off the freshly dyed streamers is one of the last steps. The site on the Gojo River where the washing takes place is listed in the "100 famous cherry blossom spots" by the Japan Cherry Blossom Association.
 
    As pink petals from the blooming trees overhead floated on the river's surface, Hiroaki Matsuura, the 52-year-old craftsman at the Nakashimaya banner shop, carefully scraped off the glue that borders the streamers' designs, using a brush to clean them. 
 
    While this year's Iwakura Cherry Blossom Festival was canceled to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, people coming to see the cherry blossoms were happily surprised to see them in a dual spectacle with the streamers.
 
    Matsuura said, "I'm happy I could work while the cherry blossoms were in full bloom." Looking ahead to their use on Children's Day, he added his hopes that children grow up healthily and in a relaxed way, like one of the large carp streamers.
