Android Headlines / Android News / Android Tablets / Amazon accidentally leaks Pixel Tablet specs, release date & price Amazon has spilled the beans on the Google Pixel Tablet days before the official launch. The new tablet is slated to debut this Wednesday, April 10, during the Google I/O conference. But the e-commerce biggie jumped the gun to list the product on its Japanese website prematurely. It has since removed the listing, but not before the internet could get a grasp of the device’s detailed specs, release date, and local pricing structure. The briefly-online Pixel Tablet page on Amazon Japan (via) confirmed that the device features a 10.95-inch LCD screen with a 2560×1600 pixels resolution and 500 nits of peak brightness. It supports USI 2.0 stylus. Under the hood is Google‘s second-gen custom processor Tensor G2, which also powers the Pixel 7 lineup. The company has paired the SoC with 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB/256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. The tablet seemingly doesn’t take in a MicroSD card for expandable storage. The Pixel Tablet has two cameras in total, one each on the front and back. Both are 8MP sensors that can capture 1080p videos at 30fps (frames per second). Google will include features like Eraser Magic and Photo Unblur here. The table also boasts three microphones, a quad-speaker setup, a USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 1 port, and a 4-pin accessory connector. Connectivity options will include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and Ultrawide Band (UWB), while the batlet should boot to Android 13. The whole package is fueled by a 27 Wh battery that gives you “up to 12 hours of video streaming.” The now-deleted Amazon listing for the Pixel Tablet mentioned a June 20 release date for the tablet, at least in Japan. It’s unclear if Google will bring the device to the market earlier in other regions. It isn’t looking likely, though. There haven’t been as many leaks about the new tablet as the Pixel 7a, which will debut on the same day (April 10) and is expected to go on sale next week. Wednesday’s event will also bring the Pixel Fold, Google’s first-ever foldable smartphone. While we wait for the official confirmation about Pixel Tablet’s release date, the Amazon listing revealed that the tablet will cost ¥79,800 (roughly $591) for the 128GB storage option. It may cost slightly more in some other markets, though. An earlier leak quoted a price of €600-650 (roughly $660 to $720). The tablet will come with a charging and speaker dock in most markets if not all. It will be available in two colors — Porcelain with a beige rear panel and white bezels and Hazel in a green and black combination. Stay tuned for the official launch in a couple of days.
