The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox.  The community and the country have rallied around a Kansas City, Missouri, 16-year-old after he was shot in what police say was a case of a wrong address. Ralph Yarl was sent to pick up his siblings Thursday night at a home off Northeast 115th Terrace in northern Kansas City, police said. But, Ralph accidentally went to the wrong address, one located along Northeast 115th Street.  Police said after he knocked at the door, Yarl was shot. Social media rumors began and protests were built after police said the homeowner believed to have shot Yarl was initially released from custody without being charged.  Yarl's family has since hired two high-profile civil rights attorneys to take the case. Here's what we know, and what we don't know, about this shooting.  The superintendent for the North Kansas City School District called 16-year-old Yarl "an excellent student and talented musician" in an email sent to district parents Monday. Yarl is a student at Staley High School, and his younger siblings also attend an elementary school in the district. Yarl was sent to pick those siblings up from a friend's house, family members said, Thursday night when he was shot.  "I share in the shock and disbelief of this horrific incident. No child nor family should ever experience such violence," said Superintendent Dr. Daniel Clemens in the email.  In a GoFundMe, Yarl's aunt, Dr. Faith Spoonmore, said Yarl mistakenly went to the wrong house — just one block away.  Spoonmore said Yarl pulled into the driveway and rang the doorbell — that's when he was shot. "The man in the home opened the door, looked my nephew in the eye, and shot him in the head," Spoonmore said in the GoFundMe. "My nephew fell to the ground, and the man shot him again. Ralph was then able to get up and run to the neighbor's house, looking for help." Spoonmore added that Yarl had to run to three different homes before someone agreed to help him — but only after he was told to lie on the ground with his hands up.  "Ralph P. Yarl is a fantastic kid, and I am not just saying this because he is my nephew. He truly is," Spoonmore said.  Yarl was rushed to an area hospital in critical condition. He was released from the hospital days later. Spoonmore said in an update on the GoFundMe that while Yarl is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally.  The Clay County Prosecutor’s Office filed charges Monday evening against 84-year-old Andrew Lester in the shooting. This is what Lester told police in the statement he provided immediately following the shooting.  The stretch of time between the incident and the charges sparked protests across the metro area. Kansas City police Chief Stacey Graves said in a news conference Sunday that the investigation into this case remains active. Police said investigators were hoping to speak with Yarl himself about what led up to the shooting. With a victim statement, Graves said the case could be turned over to the prosecutor's office. "A person can be held up for 24 hours for investigation of a felony, at which time they're required by Missouri law to be charged or released," Graves said. "The vast majority of cases to include violent crime involve the suspect being released pending further investigation. In this case, the prosecutor requires more information from investigators. That would take more than 24 hours to compile." Graves said the department responded, processed the scene and recovered the firearm immediately after the shooting. The  Clay County, Missouri Prosecutor's Office said the office did not receive a criminal referral from police in this case until early Monday afternoon. "We understand how frustrating this has been, but we can assure the public that the system is working," A spokesperson for the Clay County's Prosecutors Office said Monday. "As with any serious case submitted to our office, we will approach this case in an objective and impartial manner. We ask the public to trust the system to achieve a just result." Lester's whereabouts were unknown at the time charges were announced in the case.  He surrendered himself to the Clay County Detention Center Tuesday afternoon and was released a short time later after posting bond.  Just before 4 p.m. on April 17, the Kansas City Police Department said it submitted a case file to the Clay County Prosecutor's Office for consideration of charges in the shooting.  The Clay County Prosecutor’s Office filed charges shortly thereafter against Andrew Lester in the shooting of Ralph Yarl. Lester is charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. If convicted, he could spend life in prison. A probable cause document released shortly after charges were filed details police reports of the incident.  The document said Lester told police he picked up his gun before responding to the door. Lester told authorities he believed someone was attempting to break inside his house. Lester provided written consent to search his residence. An officer observed the front storm glass door broken with blood on the front porch. The officer also observed blood on the driveway, cameras on the south and east side of residence, and blood in the street in front of a nearby house. Lester said it was "the last thing he wanted to do" but was "scared to death" because of Yarl's size and his age. The probable cause states Lester believes he was protecting himself, but later expressed concern for the victim. Lester appeared in court for an arraignment on Wednesday, April 19. His attorney entered a "not guilty" plea to two felony counts. Lester's next court date isn't scheduled until June 1. He remains out on bond.  Yarl's family has retained nationally renowned civil rights and personal injury attorneys Ben Crump and Lee Merritt in this case. Crump is perhaps best known for handling cases in the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and more.  Ben Crump Law released this statement about the case: "There is no excuse for the release of this armed and dangerous suspect after admitting to shooting an unarmed, non-threatening, and defenseless teenager that rang his doorbell. We demand swift action from Clay County prosecutors and law enforcement to identify, arrest, and prosecute to the full extent of the law the man responsible for this horrendous and unjustifiable shooting." Ben Crump Law and many community members say race may be the catalyst behind this case. The email from Crump Law said Yarl, a Black teen, "was shot twice in the head and arm by an unidentified white male assailant." When asked if she believed the shooting was racially motivated, Graves said she was aware of the racial component of the case, but the information the department had as of Sunday doesn't point to race. "The information that we have now, it does not say that it's racially motivated," Graves said in the Sunday news conference. "But, as a chief of police, I do recognize the racial component of this case. I do recognize and understand the community's concern and the community's response to this particular incident." Mayor Quinton Lucas also addressed race and this case saying, "The question related to racial dynamics as it relates to this case, is some of the discussion that's occurring now. Part of the reason I think you see the department here and speaking is one to make clear and prevent ways, different from the past, that is understood." Lucas went on to say he knew there were people who have concerns, and that those concerns were not being "dismissed, marginalized, or diminished in any way." Crump said Sunday that it is "inescapable not to acknowledge the racial dynamics at play." Hate crime charges are handled at a federal level, meaning the FBI would have to become involved.  Lee Merritt, the other attorney obtained as part of the contract with Ben Crump Law, tweeted Monday that he wants to clarify two things concerning the shooting of Yarl, first that the suspect involved was not detained for 24 hours. "He was released in under two hours after providing a statement to police," Merrit said in the tweet. Merritt also said officers took a statement from Yarl in his hospital bed Friday, though Graves said they hoped for a statement from the teen so a case could be forwarded to prosecutors.  Merritt said Yarl was released from the hospital and remains under the care of his doctors at home.  In the GoFundMe, Yarl's aunt said that while he is doing well physically, he has a long road ahead mentally and emotionally. Less than a week after he was shot, family members say Yarl is at home and walking around. He has a traumatic brain injury that will require additional therapy. They said if the bullet had gone just a fraction of an inch in a different direction, Yarl likely would not have survived.  The GoFundMe raising money for Yarl's care and attorney fees surpassed $2 million in less than 48 hours.  The case has spilled into the national conversation as well, garnering comments from celebrities and even Vice President Kamala Harris.
