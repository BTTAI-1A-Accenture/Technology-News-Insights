 At UNB you will enjoy learning from cutting-edge expert Computer Scientists in a long-standing program; the Faculty of Computer Science (FCS) at the UNB’s Fredericton Campus was the first computer science faculty in Canada. Our students enjoy working and collaborating with top faculty who are nationally and internationally renowned in their field. Our recent graduates have gone on to work at companies such as IBM, Ciena, Alcatel-Lucent and Ernst & Young, as well as to careers in academia. Research students take some courses, but primarily focus on original research. Potential supervision for research students includes the following areas: We have a growing number of full-time research faculty in Fredericton including a Canada Research Chair in Cybersecurity. The Faculty has more than 20 laboratories, used for research and instruction in many areas of computer science, and we also have one Research Centre: the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies – Atlantic, and two Institutes: Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity & Research Institute in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RIDSAI). Researchers in the Department of Computer Science at the Saint John campus also participate in the UNB CS graduate programs. At present the total research funding for the Faculty of Computer Science is approximately $10 million from NSERC, CFI, AIF, NBIF and other sources.
