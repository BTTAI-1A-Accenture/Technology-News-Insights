The biggest news went down Saturday, as the Rangers acquired veteran ace Max Scherzer as the Mets decided to pivot to selling. Days later, New York shipped Justin Verlander to Houston.  Before the Scherzer deal, the Angels took two of the best trade candidates off the market on Wednesday night. First, the Angels decided to keep two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani at the deadline, and then they showed their commitment to buying around Ohtani by trading for White Sox starter Lucas Giolito. The Dodgers also revamped, adding Lance Lynn, Joe Kelly, Amed Rosario, Kiké Hernández and others. Here are all the moves leading up to the 6 p.m. deadline Tuesday. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.
