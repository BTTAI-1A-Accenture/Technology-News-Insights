We have good news and bad news for Sex Education fans. The good news is Netflix just dropped the season four trailer. The bad news is the teaser confirmed that the upcoming installment will be the show’s last. (Womp, womp.) Today, Netflix released an official trailer for Sex Education season four, and it confirmed that there are plenty more laughs and awkward encounters to come before the session ends. The trailer reveals that the story will pick up where the third season concludes, with the staff and students transferring to Cavendish Sixth Form College after Moordale Secondary closes its doors. Unfortunately, very little has changed—especially for Otis Milburn (Asa Butterfield). “I just wanted to let you know a little bit about myself. I spend a lot of my free time thinking about sex,” Otis tells the horrified students. “Thinking about sex comes very naturally, because I learned everything I know about sex from my mom.” Talk about a first impression. Several familiar faces will reprise their roles in Sex Education season four, including Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Chinenye Ezeudu, Kedar Williams-Sterling, Dua Saleh, Aimee Lou Wood, Connor Swindells and Emma Mackey. The new season will also include appearances by Jodie Turner-Smith (Queen & Slim) and Dan Levy (Schitt’s Creek), along with newcomers Felix Mufti, Anthony Lexa, Alexandra James, Reda Elazouar, Bella Maclean and Imani Yahshua. The fourth—and final—season of Sex Education will hit Netflix on September 21. *Sets calendar reminder* Want Netflix's top shows sent right to your inbox? Click here.
