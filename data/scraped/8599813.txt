Updated: May 2, 2024 eBay is an e-commerce platform, at first only providing customer-to-customer auction services, expanding into business-to-consumer shortly afterwards. In the 2000’s, eBay went on a spending spree that saw it taking ownership of PayPal, Skype and Stubhub, although it has since relinquished ownership of all three businesses. It is one of the few success stories of the dot-com bubble, which eBay fought through after going public in September 1998. By 2001, it was considered the world’s largest e-commerce website, and a year later it purchased payment service PayPal for $1.5 billion. In the early 2000s, purchasing items over the web from random strangers was not common. Before eBay and PayPal, scams were frequent and there wasn’t much in the way of assurances that the item would arrive and if it did, that it would match the description provided.- Advertisement -Maximize Your Ad Reach with ASTRADHarness the power of ASTRAD to optimize your campaigns and drive real results.

In eBay’s case, the review system for sellers and buyers prevented enabled both sides to feel secure in their transaction, while PayPal prevented fraud. PayPal was the first in what would be a great expansion of eBay’s footprint. In the next five years, it spent $1.7 billion on acquisitions for classified advertising platforms, $2.6 billion for Skype and $310 for Stubhub. This conglomeration of digital assets made eBay a larger company, but by 2010, several investors and division leaders saw eBay’s ownership of Skype, PayPal and other services as detrimental to both parties. Add to that Amazon had taken eBay’s title as largest e-commerce platform away and was generating three times as much revenue by 2010, and eBay’s spending spree had lost its luster. eBay would sell Skype to a private equity group, which would then sell it to Microsoft in 2011. In 2014, eBay announced it would spin-out PayPal, which had become larger than eBay. At the time of writing, PayPal is valued at over five times eBay in market cap. Since the PayPal split, eBay has been focused on growing advertising revenue and maintaining its base of customers, which are primarily based in the US and UK.
