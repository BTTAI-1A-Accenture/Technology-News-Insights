Starting October 8, 2024, the American Express Cobalt’s earn rate on travel purchases will decrease from 2 Membership Rewards (MR) points per dollar spent to 1 MR point per dollar spent.

Despite this change, the Amex Cobalt remains a strong contender for everyday spending in Canada, particularly due to its impressive 5 points per dollar earn rate on groceries, dining and drinks.

Card details Our editors apply their credit card expertise and knowledge of Canadians’ financial goals to come up with selection criteria that matches the needs of the intended cardholder. For travel credit cards, your return on spending is a key consideration, because it represents the value of the points you are earning with every purchase. We consider annual fees and eligibility criteria (for student cards), perks and insurance (for premium cards) and other factors, specific to the category. The addition of links from affiliate partners has no bearing on the results. Read more about our selection process and about how MoneySense makes money. The best travel credit card will depend on your needs, travel habits and how you intend to use the card. The American Express Cobalt, for example, is our pick for the best overall travel rewards credit card because you have the ability to earn rewards at a high rate across everyday purchases. The Scotia Gold Amex is a close second, because of its high earn rates and strong insurance package.   The most common types of travel points programs are consistent or chart-based. With consistent rewards programs, the value of the points is always the same. For example, BMO Ascend World Elite users earn BMO Rewards points, for which 150 points equals $1 in travel rewards. Point values in chart-based programs depend on variables like the destination, ticket price and time of travel. Points redemption for the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite are based on Aeroplan’s dynamic redemption chart. Consistent points programs are ideal if you want a simple redemption process. Chart-based programs are more complex, but potentially more valuable. Some credit cards offer you the ability to earn rewards on everyday purchases and other purchase categories, which can be redeemed towards a wide variety of things, including travel. This means you are not necessarily limited to booking through certain airlines when redeeming your points on flights. You may also be able to transfer your credit card points to an airline rewards program, such as with the American Express Cobalt. Some travel credit cards offer rewards with specific airlines where your points’ redemption values may vary, such as the TD Aeroplan Visa Infinite card. When you accumulate enough points, you can book a flight or vacation package with affiliated airlines like WestJet or Air Canada. Keep in mind though that the value of your points can depend on the date of your flight and your destination.  Hotel rewards credit cards offer you the ability to redeem your points towards a hotel stay, and to earn points when you book at affiliated hotels like Marriott or Delta, or earn perks such as room upgrades or free breakfasts when you book eligible hotel stays. If you frequently book hotels for work or travel, consider a hotel rewards credit card like the Marriott Bonvoy American Express. Some important features to look out for in travel credit cards, besides points value and your booking redemption options (flights, hotels, cars), include:  Whether the card charges you foreign transaction fees while you are abroad, on top of regular exchange rates. These fees can be as high as an added 2.5% on every purchase. Not all travel reward programs are created equal. So how do you choose the right one for you?  First, it’s important to understand that travel rewards programs can be broken down into two basic types: Consistent and chart-based. It’s worth noting that in rare cases, like the American Express Membership Rewards Program, you might get to choose to redeem points for travel based on either a consistent system or as a chart-based system. Many of the big banks offer consistent points travel reward programs. They’re aimed at people who want to operate within a simple program that has an easy-to-understand redemption process; people who dislike complicated programs will appreciate these. Chart-based programs can be considerably more complicated—but also potentially more valuable. Since the number of points needed to redeem for a flight isn’t consistent, using the rewards chart strategically can help you stretch the value of your points and net a higher return when flying on certain routes, or even when booking premium seats or business class. These programs are more popular with personal finance enthusiasts and left-brain thinkers. Aeroplan’s chart system uses Miles to measure the minimum point redemptions. For shorter flights within North America, you’d need at least 6,000-22,500 points for an Economy flight, 35,000-70,000 points for North America and Atlantic zones, and so on.  Air Miles does not have a set flight chart. The number of Air Miles Dream miles needed for a free flight varies significantly as pricing is based on demand and what carrier and class you select. On average, 1 Air Mile point is worth 12.1 cents in travel rewards. Premium Avion cardholders need at least 15,000 points for a flight within or near your province or territory, at least 35,000 points for a flight within North America, 65,000 points for a flight to Europe and 100,000 points for other destinations around the globe.  Using the American Express Fixed Points Program, you’d need at least 15,000 points for a short flight within North America, 20,000 points for a flight from a Canadian province or territory to a nearby U.S. State, 40,000 points for a longer North American route, 50,000 points for a vacation destination and at least 60,000 points for Europe or 100,000 points for other continents.  1 point is worth 1 cent. For a $300 airline ticket, you’d need 300,000 Scene points.  You can redeem your points for a statement credit towards flights. 1 BMO Rewards point is worth 0.7 of a cent in travel rewards. You need a minimum of 200 points for a redemption through Expedia for TD. 1 TD Rewards point is worth 0.5 cents in travel rewards.  You can redeem a minimum of 10,000 points for a $100 statement credit on travel.  Some travel rewards points expire after a certain period of inactivity, while others do not. For example, Aeroplan points expire after 18 months of inactivity, and Marriott Bonvoy points expire after 24 months, while WestJet dollars generally do not expire, unless they were earned during certain promotions or other circumstances. To avoid having your points expire, you can book hotels with your points, buy products through the loyalty program’s store, transfer points from another program or to a family member, in some cases, and more.
