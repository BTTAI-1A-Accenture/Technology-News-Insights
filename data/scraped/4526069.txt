The collaboration will extend to Oncoshot’s strategic contract research organisation and pharmaceutical partners. Together, they will focus on recruiting participants for upcoming studies scheduled to begin in Q1 2024.  “This collaboration marks a significant step in Oncoshot’s vision of creating a cancer cohort discovery platform and upcoming national-level clinical trials ecosystems and hospitals globally,” said Oncoshot CEO Dr Huren Sivaraj. Central to this partnership is the cost-free infrastructure designed to facilitate the real-time exchange of aggregated insights. This ground-breaking initiative is set to synergise their complementary strengths to enhance various clinical trial aspects throughout Japan, including feasibility assessments, participant screening, and enrolment. Japan is currently ranked as the third-largest pharmaceutical market worldwide. Notably, around 70% of clinical trials executed in Japan struggle to achieve their target patient enrolment within the designated timeframe. Buzzreach CEO Mr Takateru Inokawa added: “We believe this partnership will positively impact clinical trials in Japan. Our shared commitment to innovation and data-driven approaches will benefit all stakeholders in healthcare research.” Together, they will support end-to-end data-driven clinical trial delivery, leveraging their respective strengths.
