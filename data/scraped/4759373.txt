In ranking the best HR analytics software we reviewed dozens of different types of analytics software. We settled on the choices in this list because of the wide range of needs that businesses have. We considered a number of items and those that performed pretty well across the board were chosen to be included in this list. Here are some examples of the things that we covered. For pricing, we considered the cost per user per month for each paid plan, minimum user requirements, introductory pricing, the availability of free trials, free trial length and money-back guarantees. Pricing accounts for 10% of our total score. We analyzed each HR analytics software based on key features such as reporting and analytics, and core features such as applicant tracking, benefits administration, time and attendance tracking, payroll, leave management, learning management tools, e-signatures, reviews and employee feedback. These key features make up 30% of our score. In addition to the key features, we also devoted 20% of our score to whether or not the services included unique features that could make a difference for certain businesses and use cases, such as shift scheduling, engagement tools, tax functionality, PTO requests and approvals, and custom branding. We also looked at customer reviews to determine if user experience matches marketing promises. We considered each provider’s average rating and how many reviews each had and weighed them at 10%. We also added our expert opinion based on first-hand experience using these different HR analytics software across several different use cases. This includes factors such as ease of use, value for price, the quality of its features and popularity. This accounts for 30% of the total score. The best HR analytics software is going to be software that is data-driven and easy to customize. This will allow you to get the most out of your data and enable you to get real information that you can take action on for your employees. There are several things you can look for when choosing the best HR analytics software for your business. First, it’s important to consider the variety of features and types of analytics that can be measured with the software. If you’re looking for data on your whole people function you don’t want a software that just tracks recruiting metrics. That wouldn’t give you a full understanding of what’s happening with your employees. Next, it’s important to find software that has a flat cost you can afford. You don’t want to be charged for running data queries or adopt an analytics platform that costs a lot because it was built to track more in-depth data for developers. You want something that specializes in HR analytics so that you can find the right cost for your budget. Finally, you want to look for something that is easy to use. Navigating data and getting the right answers from it can be difficult enough without having to worry about frustrations in navigating the software itself. You want something that is intuitive and can be learned very quickly so that you can customize reporting and get the answers you need. There are many different types of benefits from using HR analytics software. Some are very apparent as you’re able to get answers to your questions while others are indirectly beneficial to your business. Here are some of the most common benefits associated with a business starting to track employee data through an HR analytics software: Featured Partners 1 Justworks Yes Yes $50/month + $8/user 1 Justworks On Justworks' Website 2 SurePayroll Yes Yes $29.99/mo plus $5 per employee 2 SurePayroll On SurePayroll's Website 3 OnPay Yes Yes $40 per month + $6 per user 3 OnPay On OnPay's Website 4 Rippling Yes Yes $35 per month + $8 per user 4 Rippling On Rippling's Website 5 Gusto Yes Yes $40 per month plus $6 per user 5 Gusto On Gusto's Website HR teams use a variety of analytics tools. Many HR apps come with their own built-in analytics that vary pretty widely. Many teams end up finding their own analytics solution that specializes in helping HR teams perform better and get a more in-depth look at the people side of the business. The best HR analytics software options are what most businesses use if they are wanting to get serious about the HR side of their business. The HR team uses data analytics to identify how well they’re performing, where applicants are dropping off in the recruiting process, how many employees participate in company events and so much more. It enables your business to measure the impact of the HR team and how your people efforts directly impact the overall business performance. HR analytics software can give you a better understanding of your business and the employees of that business. It can help you make more informed decisions, identify skill gaps and better recruit and retain high-performing employees. Without an analytics solution, you’re generally acting on a gut feeling instead of making decisions based on real data. As with most types of software, the best analytics software programs offer many levels of security. When choosing this type of software, you want to look for security features that include documentation that shows frequent security updates and patches, intrusion detection, the monitoring of user activities, data encryption, privacy protection and two-factor authentication (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA).
