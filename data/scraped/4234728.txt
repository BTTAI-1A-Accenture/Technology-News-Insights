There’s truly nothing better than jumping into bed with a new pair of the best bed sheets (freshly cleaned, of course). It’s finding the right set for you, that can be the challenge. “The right set of sheets sets the stage for your entire sleeping experience,” said Dennis Chan, director of retail products for Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.  “When choosing your bedding, investing in durability, design, and feel makes all the difference,” Chan told The Post. “Superior bedding will feel great against your skin and will withstand the test of time by maintaining quality night after night. Sheets should also complement your personal style. The bed is the centerpiece of your room after all!” In an effort to help you find the perfect set of sheets, we sifted through the Internet to find the most well-loved and reviewed options on the market. Whether you’re looking for something in sateen like the Luxe Sateen Sheet from Brooklinen or prefer something cooling and sustainable, like the Buffy Eucalyptus Sheets, we’ve found the sets and brands that have you and your mattress covered.

Reviews: 22,000+ Brooklinen’s bestselling Luxe Sheets have quite literally taken over the internet since the brand released the set in April 2014 — and the review count certainly proves that! They come in over a dozen different colors and patterns and the set includes a flat sheet, two pillowcases, one fitted sheet, and a duvet with side ties. In terms of comfort, the sheets are made of 480 thread count long-staple cotton, which means they’re soft and cool. They also have a glossy, almost silky sheen, giving them a more luxurious look. I love how they’re available in a variety of colors, and that a duvet cover is also included. Many other customers agree, too.  Editor’s Note: “The Luxe Core Sheet Set looks clean and is so comfortable to sink into at night,” said Victoria Giardina, Content Strategist and Commerce Journalist on The Post’s Shopping team. ” For hot and cool sleepers alike, I would say the Luxe Core Sheet Set is a great, light, and airy option. I like to sleep with a million and one blankets and shorts, practically all year round, and Brooklinen delivers an exceptional, sound sleep. So much so, it’s a struggle to leave bed some mornings.” Reviews: 80+ If a high thread count is a necessity for you, you can’t go wrong with this option from Avocado Green Mattress. The Superfine Suvin Sheets are made exclusively from GOTS organic certified Indian suvin cotton, one of the world’s rarest extra-long-staple cotton varieties.  They offer 1,000 thread counts per inch, a lavishly soft feel that improves with each wash. Consider this your eco-friendly, luxury option. The sheets are not prone to overheating and are incredibly strong because of the high thread count. Their durability is tangible, plus they are just pretty. Each has a sheen, according to the site, but we only notice it with the sheets in grey. Not a deal breaker if you like the gloss of sateen sheets. However, since these are suvin and not sateen, this may be a point of contention. Editor’s Note: “I’ve been a not-so-secret admirer of Avocado Green Mattress for as long as I’ve been writing for The Post,” said Giardina. “Its commitment to sustainability is second to none, and that’s reflected within its Organic Superfine Suvin Cotton Sheets. These sheets offer a glamorous 1,000 thread count with a feel that’s right on the money. Its lustrous and lavish finish makes all the difference, speaking on behalf of hot sleepers everywhere.” Reviews: 3,800+ The Buffy Eucalyptus sheets are another well-loved set of sheets on the Internet. They’re 100% sustainable, cool, breathable, and gentle on the skin. They come in 20 different colors (when they’re not sold out!) and made with super-soft, 300 single-ply thread count sateen weave fabric woven from TENCEL™ lyocell fibers — that absorbs moisture more efficiently than conventional cotton, keeping your skin feeling cool and dry throughout the night. Editor’s Note: “After testing out Buffy sheets, I discovered that eucalyptus is even softer than cotton,” said Commerce Writer and Reporter, Miska Salemann. “These sheets have a cloud-like texture, just rub it between your hands and you will definitely be able to tell the difference. Also worth noting: I have noticed that these sheets stay cleaner and smell much fresher than some others I’ve tried. I have a furry dog and rarely notice his hair sticking to these sheets. They come out of the wash looking brand-new. As far as sustainably-produced sheets go, it’s hard to find a better set.” Reviews: 6,000+ Cozy Earth’s Bamboo Sheet Set is made of 100% premium viscose from bamboo. Featuring an oversized fit and gentle drape, the temperature-regulating sheets are uniquely soft and only get softer with every wash. Like many people, I like to reach for sustainable options when I can, and bamboo is definitely like. Many reviews rave about the softness of this sheet set using words like “butter” and “cloud-like” to describe them. In fact, 97% of folks who’ve purchased on Cozy Earth would recommend them. Best of all, because the sheets are available in Split King, they could work for an adjustable bed! Available in 16 colors. Editor’s Note: “I immediately loved the silky-smooth texture of these sheets — and after sleeping on them for several months, I can attest that they did in fact only get softer over time,” noted Hannah Southwick, Page Six Commerce Writer and Reporter. “Perhaps more importantly, though, the breathable bamboo knit has kept me from overheating on hot nights (something traditional cotton bedding has never accomplished, in my experience). While I historically haven’t splurged as much in the bedding department, this luxe-feeling fabric has me questioning how I ever lived without it.” Reviews: 8,000+ These bestselling sheets from Luxome are nothing to sleep on. Naturally moisture-wicking and silky smooth, they feel amazing after a long hard day. They have extra deep pockets and extra corner bands to keep them from slipping off the mattress. What I like best about the sheets is how they feel. They’re softer than cotton, have a gorgeous sheen, and a high-quality feel that makes the sleep experience better.  Editor’s Note: “I’m a hot sleeper, and have tested out several fabrics in search of a cooler night’s sleep. Luxome’s sheets are 100% Viscose from Bamboo — rather than a cheap blend — and this makes all the difference in keeping the fabric cool and breathable,” explained Meaghan Roche, Senior Commerce SEO Manager. “When I put the fresh sheets on my bed, I was delighted to find the extra-deep pockets making it so easy to make the bed, and the flat sheet seemed extra long and wide, even on my king bed — anyone sleeping alongside a partner knows this is a major plus. The bamboo fabric is designed to be naturally thermal-regulating, which is a blessing for hot sleepers. The silky, cool-to-the-touch feel helps me fall asleep and stay asleep. Every night I look forward to getting into bed and having another great night’s sleep thanks to these sheets.” Reviews: 300,000+ Amazon is always a good place to find new bedding, especially bed sheets. This set from Amazon Basics has amazing reviews and is soft and light. My favorite part is that the set is under $50. It also comes in lots of different colors and is easy to care for. “I was skeptical about these sheets because of the price point. It seems impossible to find any sheet set under $20 that is comfortable to sleep on,” pointed out Salemann. “However, I went ahead and tried these out and have never looked back. They came out of the wash without any fuzz, feeling smooth and soft to the touch. I’ve even noticed my skin is breaking out less with these sheets – probably because the microfiber is super gentle. My favorite part about them is how lightweight they are compared to some other brands I’ve tried. I don’t like to feel weighed down when I am sleeping, so these are perfect for me.” Pros: Cons: Reviews: N/A We’ve all been there. Some days, you want to check into a hotel and wrap yourselves up in designer, hotel-quality sheets. These whimsical sheets from Pottery Barn’s LoveShackFancy collection provide the same look and feel. Between the classic, embroidered detailing and a 200-thread count — every night will feel like a vacation. Editor’s Note: “From an aesthetic point-of-view, it’s hard to find anything that tops embroidered sheets,” said Salemann. “I love all the details on this set, from the soft ivory foundation to crisp scalloped edges, and elegant tonal embroidery, which is offered in blue, lavender, and pink. This pop of piping adds just a bit of character to your bedding set without taking all the attention away from your other decor — making layering that much easier. The fit is also excellent. You’ll find elastic around the entire internal edge of the fitted sheet which wraps closely around the mattress. I’m yet to see a wrinkle. The pillowcase also features a flap to hold the pillow in place, so you don’t have to worry about it scrunching up on one side or the other. In terms of feel, these aren’t too different from other cotton sheets you’ll find in the 200-count range, they’re dry and exceptionally breathable — but the main selling point here is certainly the design. It’s rare to find sheets that look like they belong in a hotel. These do. “ Reviews: 2700+  Quince’s viscose sheets are crafted from organic bamboo, which is one of the planet’s most resource-efficient materials. They don’t just boast that luxury silky feel, but also keep you cool in the summer months. The material does lend a small amount of shine, for that hotel-quality look. Editor’s Note: “They’re under $100, which, in my opinion, is reasonable. More importantly (and impressively), they’re high quality,” shared Commerce Updates Editor, Holly J. Coley. “They’re silky smooth, cool to the touch, and naturally hypoallergenic, which I love because I have sensitive skin. I love the glossy sheen they have to them, which makes them look far more expensive than they actually are. Although they’re prone to wrinkling, I love them, especially during the hotter months. And when I think about them also being organic…insert mind blown emoji,” Coley concluded. Reviews: 30+ Magic Linen (a brand loved by Meghan Markle) is known for its white linen sheets, and according to reviews — you definitely don’t want to miss out on them!  Customers are saying: “These linen sheets are everything I hoped for and more,” said a reviewer. “They are beautiful in texture and appearance, and [they’re] husband and cat-approved too!” “My sister encouraged me to try linen sheets for the best sleep. I was so used to soft cotton and satin that linen sounded less than appealing. [Boy], was I wrong!” said another reviewer. “My husband and I love these sheets — they are soft, warm, and light (yes, both). We will never go back to cotton.”  Reviews: 40,000+ Saatva’s organic cotton sheets are an incredible option that will make getting out of bed even harder — but who said that’s a bad thing, right?  They’re made of 100% GOTS-certified organic cotton that’s silky-soft and features a 300 thread count sateen weave that gets softer with every wash. Customers are saying: “I’m by no means an experienced sheet “buyer”, but I will say this: Saatva sheets are an excellent addition to our bed. They are soft to the touch, and help keep us cool,” said one reviewer. “I generally sleep cool, but my fiance sleeps hot, and these sheets work well for both of us. Not much more to say other than I’m very glad I spent the extra money…definitely worth every penny. And the packaging was incredible! This was truly a luxury experience.” Reviews: N/A Woven from premium extra-long staple cotton, in a 400-thread count, single ply, sateen weave, these white sheets will feel beautifully smooth and silky against your skin. Its simple yet classic hem gives it crisp and clean lines for a timeless look for your bedroom.  Personally, I love the classic look and feel of these bedsheets. Let’s be real, how can you go wrong with long staple cotton? However, I do want to note that the return policy is on the stringent side. You’ll have 30 days to return, and the sheets can’t be washed or used. Given that most defects are discovered after doing those two things, the policy is on the pointless side. Still, the bedding is lovely and we don’t see much reason for returning other than you’ve ordered the wrong size. Customer are saying: N/A Reviews: 338,000+ For a quality and budget-friendly option that will keep you cool at night, consider the bestselling Mellanni sheet set that has more than 300,000 reviews on Amazon. They come in 40 colors and cost less than $40 for a queen size. What more could you ask for?  Although these are a frugal person’s dream, the sheets offer a wealth of desirable traits, including being moisture-wicking. stain resistant and quick drying. I would have loved a set in college when I didn’t have much time to deal with laundry or maintaining the look of my bedding. They are on the thin side, which is not a great thing. However, the price makes up for it.  Customers are saying: “I bought these in 2017 and have loved them ever since and after many washes,” said a reviewer from March 2023. “They did not start to pill until about year five and hold up very well. I recently purchased a [luxury set of sheets from another brand] for $400 wanting to splurge. Long story short I am returning them because these ones are really so much softer and overall better for $35!!”  Reviews: 5,000+ Parachute’s Percale Venice Sheets are another option that is well-reviewed. They’re crafted in Portugal from 100% premium, certified long-staple Egyptian cotton, which is lightweight and durable with a crisp finish that ages well. Although some dislike the crumply sound percale sheets make, I don’t mind it, and neither do many others. In an odd way, it adds to the “fresh” feeling these naturally cooling sheets have. They also feel lovely against the skin, as one reviewer pointed out. They said, “Terrific. Study soft fabric. Great size with elastic that holds the sheet in place. Love them.”  Customers are saying: “O really do like these sheets. This is my second set. The fabric is smooth and soft to the touch without the crinkly paper sound of some percales. Yes, there is some minor wrinkling but I remove them from the dryer while still damp and either put them directly on the bed or fold them for later use. I’m a hot sleeper and these do help much more than sateen sheets.” Reviews: 1000+ The Citizenry’s supremely soft, French linen sheets are breathable, durable, and have that perfectly imperfect look we love. Designed in a muted, mix-and-match palette and finished with eyelet detailing, each piece is stonewashed to give you the softest feel you’ll ever touch. Customers are saying: “I got a full bedding set with the sand gingham sheets/pillowcases and the olive duvet with extra pillowcases. These are truly divine. So soft, so luxurious feeling. I love sleeping on them every night!” said one reviewer.  Reviews: N/A When it comes to quality and looks, the Boll & Branch Signature Botanical Sheet Set is the way to go. These sheets not only look good but they feel good, too. They’re buttery, breathable, and get softer with every wash. It starts with the highest quality threads sourced from the finest long-staple 100% organic cotton on earth. Each thread is then luxuriously woven to ensure these sheets feel incredible for years to come. Customers are saying: “The hype is real. I thought maybe it was just the Instagram influencers I follow that talked about how great these sheets are but no, it’s true. They are worth every penny,” said one reviewer.  Reviews: 50+ For those looking for that signature T-shirt-softness on the regular, Tuft & Needle’s jersey sheets are ones you don’t want to miss out on. Made with 100% organic cotton, this low-maintenance, breathable bedding was designed to wick moisture away, prevent pilling, and not wrinkle.  Customers are saying: “This fabric is stretchy, breathable, and just all around perfect for my bed! I’ll definitely be getting another set!” said a reviewer.  Reviews: 600+ If you’ve splurged on an adjustable bed, we know you’re serious about your sleep quality. Hundreds of people think the percale weave of this bed sheet is dreamy, and I agree with them. It’s crisp and soft, having a similar feel to hotel sheets. I also like that it comes in lot of color options, because just plain white gets boring. Although some customers report wrinkles and issues with the fit, the overall feedback is positive. The sheets have a long side and short tags, as well as 360-degree elastic to prevent the edges from slipping off. As long as your mattress is up to 15 inches, you should be good. One reviewer loved the sheets so much, that she was planning to order them for her child’s birthday. Customers are saying: “Love my OneBed Queen size sheet set. I absolutely love the quality of the sheets. They’re nice, thick, and soft. It was very easy to fix my bed in 1 minute. I’m ordering another one for my daughter’s birthday.” Reviews: N/A Like everything from West Elm, these bed sheets don’t have any reviews attached. However, they are a bestseller, which tells us something. Made from sustainable botanical fibers, they have an ultra-silky feel without feeling flimsy. More absorbent than cotton and fair trade certified, this is a good option for those who run hot or like eco-friendly, luxurious feeling sheets. Customers are saying: N/A Reviews: 20+ Don’t let the lack of reviews fool you. The silk anything from LilySilk is good! And if you’re someone who cares about your hair or doesn’t like overheating in the nighttime, you may want to invest in these nice silk sheets. Naturally thermoregulating and hypoallergenic, sleeping on these is like being on the coolest, smoothest cloud. Or, something like that. The sheets are seamless, too, and come in some really gorgeous colors, including lavender, dark teal, and taupe. Customers are saying: “I am beyond obsessed with these sheets… How great is it that they offer different “qualities” (persay) of silk? If you are a beginner like me (I’ve had two silk pillow cases from other brands and that was all I’ve ever knew) … and you’re just starting to branch out into the silk world? Getting 19 momme over the 22 or 25 is definitely the way to go. You can test out the waters without spending double.,. I’ve heard silk dyes really well so if you’re choosing a color it’ll be very opaque and beautiful.. true to color (for whatever color you pick). Could only say great things.” According to Sun, textile expert and founder of Crane & Canopy there are a variety of materials that make quality bed sheets. Sun recommends to “opt for the highest-quality sheets within your price range but don’t break the bank, or worry too much about ultra-high thread counts. A higher thread count is not necessarily better!”  “The ideal thread count is typically 300 to 430 and for a premium material like 100% cotton, this will provide the best quality, feel and durability for the price. Choose natural fibers and avoid polyester and polyester-cotton. “The ideal thread count is typically 300 to 430,” explains Sun. “For a premium material like 100% cotton, this will provide the best quality, feel and durability for the price. Choose natural fibers and avoid polyester and polyester-cotton.” Although thread count is important, it shouldn’t be the only determining factor. Weave and finishing should also be considered, as well as design features that help the sheet to fit snuggly against the mattress.  To have a better understanding of thread counts, here is what each range means: Figuring out the best sheets for you will be entirely dependent on your specific needs. Also consider the time of year you’ll be enjoying the bedding. For example, sheets with a high thread count are heavier and best for colder months but not for summer. Also consider if you’re a hot sleeper or not. For those who run warm, it’s advisable to purchase sheets made of silk, bamboo or a cotton with a lower thread count.  For hot sleepers, we love a few different sheet sets, including the Bamboo Sheets from Cozy Earth ($272). They’re not flimsy but are still very breathable. Reviewers rave about their softness, plus they come in variety of colors and sizes.  Another brand we like for its cooling sheets is Luxome. Specifically, the Luxury Sheet Set ($145) which is made from 100% viscose derived from bamboo. Besides being naturally thermoregulating and moisture-wicking, the sheets have an almost silky texture that feels incredible! For something that works all year long, we look to Brooklinen. Its Luxe Sateen Hardcore Sleep Bundle is a favorite of editors and our readers. It has a 480 thread count, so it’s light but not too light. It’s also strong enough to hold up through weekly washes, tossing and turning — you know, the basics. Ultimately, the best sheets are the ones that help a person sleep the best. It’s likely that you’ll want multiple types to switch between as the seasons change. The good news is that there are plenty out there to choose from.
