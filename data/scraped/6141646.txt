 Anne Curtis is just as excited as everyone to have her sister Jasmine Curtis-Smith back on the “It’s Showtime” stage!  To mark the wonderful occasion, Anne invited her sister as a special guest on her TikTok account, where they took on a popular video trend.  “Sestra,” she wrote in the caption. “Welcome back to showtime!”  Jasmine performed on “It’s Showtime” 13 years after her last appearance on the noontime show.  She had a solo production number to “Barbie World (with Aqua)” by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice and also shared the stage with Anne.  The sisters also went to the recent GMA Gala and couldn’t hide their excitement.  Jasmine is currently working on an upcoming series with Rayver Cruz. They underwent combat firing for the show.  She also previously starred in the film "In My Mother's Skin," an entry to the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year.  “It’s Showtime” airs on GMA Network’s GTV on 12 p.m. Mondays to Fridays, and 11:30 a.m. every Saturday.        —Carby Basina/JCB, GMA Integrated News
