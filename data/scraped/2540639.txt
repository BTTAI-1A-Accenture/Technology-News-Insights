Beyoncé's Renaissance tour took the world by storm this past summer and now the movie is dominating theaters. If you missed the tour, here's your chance to see it. Scoring tickets for the coveted concert may have felt tougher than Bey's Coachella training, but even if you were lucky enough to secure seats, you knew better than to show up to the Renaissance World Tour in a lackluster outfit.
