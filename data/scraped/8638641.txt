Synchrony Financial SYF has entered into an expanded partnership with the plumbing and drain cleaning services provider, Roto-Rooter. The expanded partnership aims to provide homeowners with new financing options for their home repair needs. The partnership, which began a decade ago, provides customers with a private label credit card that offers flexible financing options, including promotional financing. The agreement is expected to empower Roto-Rooter business owners to provide flexible payment options to support immediate and urgent situations that may arise in their customers' homes. Together, Synchrony and Roto-Rooter developed an in-home digital sales tool for technicians to offer financing.   The flexible payment and promotional financing options led to negotiating a new multi-year agreement, which Synchrony is currently rolling out to Roto-Rooter's franchise and contractor locations.
