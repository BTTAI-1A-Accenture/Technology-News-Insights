Baseball Warehouse currently operates five locations, four in Maryland and one in Pennsylvania. Among the eminent names who will be teaching in Palmyra from the Warehouse are 1983 World Series MVP and Orioles Hall of Famer Rick Dempsey, MLB All-Star Mike Bordick, veteran MLB Pitcher Jay Witasick, and former MLB General Manager for the Mets and Orioles, Jim Duquette. Since its inception in 2005, In The Net Sports Complex, a sprawling 30-acre indoor/outdoor multisport facility in Palmyra, has become a cornerstone for local sports.
