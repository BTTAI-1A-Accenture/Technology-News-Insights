     IRIS Independent Research President Dr. Rebecca Grant discusses U.S. and Chinese officials meeting in Vienna amid growing tensions. The Philippines have looked to deter Chinese aggression around islands it claims as its own in the South China Sea by putting up buoys in a show of ownership, as Beijing continues to threaten its sovereignty in the region.  Five buoys carrying the Filipino flag were set up around the Spratly Islands within its Exclusive Economic Zone according to the Philippine coast guard. Five areas were claimed by the markers within the 200-mile-long stretch of islands, including along the Whitsun Reef where China moored hundreds of maritime vessels in 2021.

Manila took similar steps in May 2022 when it installed five navigational buoys around four of the Spratly Islands.  In recent years, China has attempt to assert control over the internationally-contested islands by deploying hundreds of navy and maritime vessels, as well as building up manmade islands on the reefs by dredging in sand and equipping them with missiles and runways.  This photo taken on April 21, 2023 shows heavy machinery at the Philippine-occupied Thitu Island in the disputed South China Sea. Beijing claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, including the Spratly Islands, ignoring an international ruling that the assertion has no legal basis.
