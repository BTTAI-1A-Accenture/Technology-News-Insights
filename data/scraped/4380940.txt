Making payments on a business loan can also help build and improve your business credit, which can help you qualify for more business funding in the future.  Bad credit business loans offer fast access to capital — some within as little as 12 hours of applying.  Because they are considered higher risk, lenders may not approve high loan amounts on bad credit business loans. Bad credit business loans typically have higher rates and fees than traditional loans.  You may be asked to pledge collateral on a bad credit business loan to offset some of the lender’s risk.
