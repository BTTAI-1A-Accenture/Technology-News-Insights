Login Follow SINGAPOREâS firstÂ electricÂ cargoÂ vessel is due to start sea trials and launch in the fourth quarter, according to Yinson Green Technologies, part of a consortium chosen by the city-state to help electrify marine craft.Â  The Hydromover, developed by the Goal Zero consortium, is near completion, YGT chief executive officer Eirik Barclay said in an interview in Kuala Lumpur this week. YGT will also be introducing anÂ electricÂ vessel for transferring crew âÂ developed with Norwegian startup Lift Ocean âÂ by the end of the year, Barclay said. That craft is called the Hydroglyder. âWe want to be part of all associated services with cleanÂ electricÂ vessels, starting with Singapore,â Barclay said. YGT is a subsidiary of Malaysia-listed Yinson Holdings.Â  With the local port authority requiring all new harbour craft to be zero emission by 2030, oil giant Shell launched Singaporeâs first fullyÂ electricÂ passenger ferry in May to transport workers to its refinery at Pulau Bukom.Â  The Goal Zero consortium is led by Singapore-based SeaTech Solutions International, designer of the Hydromover, which has capacity to carry 25 tons ofÂ cargoÂ and has a battery that can be swapped in minutes when depleted, according to YGTâs website.  Friday, 12.30 pm An exclusive weekly report on the latest environmental, social and governance issues. YGT will operate the harbour vessel, using it for commercial operations under its recently launched MarinEV unit. MarinEV will offer vessel leasing, servicing, maintenance and products to help the maritime industryâs transition to net zero. Singapore provided S$9 million in funding in 2021 to Goal Zero and two other consortiums led by Keppel Fels  and Sembcorp Marine to developÂ electricÂ vessels. Keppel aims to establish anÂ electricÂ vessel supply chain by 2025, while Sembcorp hasnât revealed a completion target.Â  âWe are seeing a dramatic electrification of all modes of transport, so we started by focusing of the electrification of the marine area,â said Barclay, who headed Yinson Holdingsâ offshore production business before becoming YGT CEO in January.Â  YGT also this month started RydeEV, anÂ electric bike leasing business in Malaysia with swappable battery technology, and in Q4 it will launch DrivEV in Malaysia, a leasing business forÂ electricÂ vehicles. It has already signed fleet-leasing agreements with Pos Malaysia and UEM Edgenta.Â  âIn South-east Asia there are 250 million motorbikes,â Barclay added. âOver the next 10 years, all of those are going to becomeÂ electric. So itâs an absolutely incredibly large market space to be playing in.â Through its charging business ChargEV, YGT also owns 379 EV charging stations in Malaysia, making it the largest operator in the country. It has started operations in Singapore and aims to have 10 stations by the end of the year.
