Company Average cost JD Power Rating Auto-Owners Insurance $1,048 865 GEICO $1,152 874 USAA $1,188 890 Farmers Mutual of Nebraska $1,217 -- Amco $1,310 -- Your ZIP code is one of the biggest factors in determining your insurance premiums. Car insurance companies will look at the relevant information in your area, including car thefts, accidents reported, and repair costs. City drivers will nearly always pay more in insurance, because more people on the road means more accidents and claims. ZIP code Average cost 68136 $1,481 68130 $1,506 68118 $1,511 68138 $1,527 68164 $1,550 68154 $1,555 68137 $1,561 68142 $1,561 68127 $1,577 68144 $1,586 The right car insurance company for one driver isn’t necessarily the right company for another. The only way to ensure that you are getting the best possible price for your individual situation is to compare rates between companies. Policygenius can help you understand how much coverage you need and then compare rates from top companies so you can be sure you’re getting the best car insurance policy for you at the right price. Your driving history greatly impacts your insurance rates. Accidents or moving violations will raise your rates, and if you have too many, you may find it difficult to find coverage at all. Serious violations will have a greater impact, while minor violations won’t make as big a difference.
