 IoT devices, industrial, railway, automobile, and aircraft controls, as well as healthcare devices all have 3 things in common. First, these devices run on software and that software must be secured from cyberthreats as it is being developed. Second, when operating in the field, it is necessary to provide ongoing protection through device focused certificate lifecycle management. And finally, the frequency of cyberattacks on all of these is increasing at an alarming rate.
