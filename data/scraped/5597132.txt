Emirates Post Group Company (EPG) has announced a “strategic restructuring” after transitioning to a public joint stock company, fully owned by Emirates Investment Authority. This restructuring is intended to position the company as the logistics market enabler in the UAE. EPG’s restructuring aligns with the goals of the group’s new five-year strategy, which include: transforming its postal business to digital; revamping its courier, express and parcel (CEP) business; and exploring investment opportunities to maximize value for customers and shareholders. The new structure necessitated a review of its overall business operations to improve efficiency and streamline its operations. Additionally, all subsidiaries under the group – Emirates Post, FINTX, and Electronic Documents Centre (EDC) – will undergo changes. EPG is set to adapt the conventional postal services and courier services of its subsidiary Emirates Post by expediting the digitization of its offerings and strengthening its last-mile delivery operations and e-commerce solutions, to cater to a dynamic market that is constantly evolving due to digital advancements. Similarly, EPG’s new FinTech subsidiary FINTX will continue to spearhead the digital transformation efforts to update the group’s existing financial services companies – Wall Street Exchange and Instant Cash. This is to accelerate the Group’s fintech strategy toward creating and investing in new ventures to form a fintech ecosystem of financial services and solutions in the UAE and beyond. Similarly, the group’s digital transformation subsidiary EDC will continue to focus on enhancing its digital platforms and solutions to support organizations in the logistics industry and various other industries to achieve their digital transformation goals. Alongside this, EPG will create a business unit that will focus on strategic investments and innovation. The new business unit will manage the existing investments of the group’s current portfolio and explore opportunities in new ventures. The launch of the investment unit comes with a commitment to grow EPG’s business portfolio and expand its offerings while delivering solutions. Abdulla Mohammed Alashram, group CEO of EPG, said, “The official transition of Emirates Post Group into a public joint stock company represents a pivotal point in our mission to diversify our business, improve customer experience and offer tailored services and products. It moves us closer to our primary objective of becoming the leading logistics market enabler in the region while fostering an ecosystem that integrates logistics, fintech and digital solutions. “Emirates Post Group understands the significance of staying updated with changing market dynamics and the ongoing evolution of the overall logistics industry. Consequently, we will utilize our strengths, capabilities and partnerships to grow the company and reach new heights in the future, as we continue to build on our rich history, solid foundation and talented workforce.” Read more key operations updates from the parcel and postal technology industry, here.
