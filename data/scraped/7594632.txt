     Autonomous vehicles are just starting to hit the roads, but is the sky ready for self-flying planes? The technology "is going to come to all of the airplanes eventually," Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said earlier this week, noting that his prediction includes civil aviation, not just military aircraft. The idea isn't as far-fetched as it seems: Airbus is testing DragonFly, a system that automates taxiing and landing, while startups Xwing and Natilus are working on autonomous cargo flights, seen as the most likely testing ground for self-flying planes.

             I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of self-flying aircraft. On one hand, the advancements in technology have the potential to increase efficiency and reduce human error. On the other hand, there are concerns about safety, cybersecurity, and job loss that need to be considered. It's crucial for the aviation industry to find a balance between utilizing technology and ensuring the highest level of safety for passengers.

What are your thoughts on self-flying commercial aircraft? Are you excited about the advancements in technology or cautious about the potential implications?

#aviation #technology  So many variables, I would feel more comfortable with having a human being on the flight deck. How is a robot going to do a pre-flight walk around check? I know someone is going to say the maintenance staff will do that but having the pilot do it is protocol, his life is on the line and he will point out issues. Was just on a flight this week and pilot said we took a delay because some maintenance that should have been done over night was not done right and he wanted the issue fixed. We had to taxi all the way around JFK to go through the de ice process as well. A human being can feel for ice on the wing, can a robot?

             FedEx and UPS cargo airline Ameriflight, LLC agrees to buy 20 #autonomous cargo ‚úàÔ∏è from Natilus.  

Between drones and this, package delivery is getting wilder each day. Throw in the potential of cross-continent shipping with Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, Inc., and traditional mail systems should be worried. #transportation #shipping #airline #evtol https://lnkd.in/g4AJH3Aa

             The days of single-pilot operation could be drawing nearer ‚Äî with entirely autonomous flight a possibility for much farther down the road.

             Will autonomous cargo delivery to remote areas take flight, as envisioned in the Pyka Pelican Cargo? Fast, quiet flight deliveries that are powered by electric motors making the delviery CO2 emission free?

What applications other than cargo delivery can you think of for these e-planes...?

             Ameriflight, a cargo airline that collaborates with shipping giants UPS, FedEx, and DHL, has announced a $134 million deal to purchase 20 autonomous aircraft from Natilus. ‚úàÔ∏è

The Natilus Kona planes are fully autonomous and are made with a carbon fiber, blended-wing-body that offers a 60% reduction to cost of operations and cuts carbon emissions by half.  ü¶æ

             Will tech replace the co-pilot by 2030?

Just like the navigator, technology may shake up crew dynamics sooner than expected. This is a big call!

Wonderful article discussing Airbus‚Äô trial of DragonFly technology that would allow its aircraft to conduct completely automated landings, as well assisting in flight and taxiing.

As a former commercial pilot, I have my own thoughts. Interested in yours‚Ä¶
