Traditionally, oil and gas companies favor the Republicans while the Silicon Valley leans left. Issues like abortion, taxes, diversity & inclusion and racism now play a key part in the business dynamics of corporate America. According to a Rolling Stone article published on October 22, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce poured a whopping $40 million exclusively into Republican campaigns in 2014.  However, the report noted that times are changing and the Chamber is now cutting back on its donations to the Republicans. History shows that companies always take a wait-and-see approach and take sides with the powerful. Amid a rise in awareness related to issues like LGBTQ rights, climate change, racism, women’s inclusion in workforce and minimum wage, many companies are seen to now stand with the left. A WSJ report mentioned in detail how several companies spoke against the Supreme Court’s decision which overturned Roe v. Wade, ending right to abortion.  These companies included major names like J.Crew, Levi Strauss & Co., Kering’s Gucci, Yelp Inc., Match Group Inc.’s OkCupid, Bumble Inc. and Unilever PLC’s Ben & Jerry’s. Albeit it’s known that major companies have specific political inclinations, they do not openly discusses their stance on issues like abortion.

Here is what Madison Mid Cap Fund has to say about Vontier Corporation (NYSE:VNT) in its Q3 2022 investor letter: “We exited our position in Vontier in the third quarter. We invested in the company when it was spun out of Fortive Corporation two years ago. The stock was, and remains, quite cheap, but the transformation that we expected to occur post-spin is taking a little longer than we thought. The company has a long history of operational excellence. Its core segments exhibit very high returns on capital, but are quite mature with limited growth. We thought they had a chance to re-invest excess capital into adjacent areas with more growth, but opportunities appear more limited than we had thought. We considered it better for now to re-allocate that capital ourselves.” Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) is a relatively unknown name in our list of the best pro-life companies to invest in. The Atlanta, Georgia-based company provides radiation detection, measurement, analysis, and monitoring products and services. Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) accounts for about 3.4% of Ave Maria Value Fund’s portfolio, as of the end of the third quarter. The company’s innovative technologies are expected to have a wider usage in defense, research and clean energy in the coming years. The company’s technologies can help companies harness the powers of ionizing radiation. Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) has come a long way since its inception and has evolved through different stages. The company’s revenue shows a CAGR of 10% between 2005 and 2021.

The total value of these stakes was $286 million. In the previous quarter, 23 funds had stakes in the company. Notable investors in the company include Anand Parekh’s Alyeska Investment Group and Stephen J. Errico’s Locust Wood Capital Advisers. Here is what Baron Growth Fund has to say about Mirion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:MIR) in its Q4 2021 investor letter: “This quarter, the Fund initiated a position in Mirion Technologies, Inc., a leader in ionizing radiation detection and measurement technologies to the medical, laboratory, and nuclear power industries. The business consists of a portfolio of niche, mission-critical products that represent a small portion of a project’s costs but can cause extensive collateral damage if they fail. Products include dosimeters that monitor radiation levels of medical professionals, quality assurance equipment and software for nuclear medicine treatments, and instrumentation and equipment that is core to the construction, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants. We think that Mirion has the potential to be a compelling industrial compounder. The company is already the largest player in over 80% of its end markets, and in aggregate is approximately 3.5 times larger than its nearest competitor. We estimate that Mirion’s end markets should grow at 5% to 6% annually, driven by favorable secular trends and a consistent replacement cycle. We expect Mirion to grow in line with or ahead of its end markets on an organic basis, as it leverages its scale advantage to take modest market share. Organic growth should be complemented by Mirion’s successful acquisition strategy, driving aggregate growth into the doubledigit range. In addition, we believe the company has an opportunity to expand markets by 500 bps-plus of margin over time through a favorable mix shift, higher utilization rates, and ongoing M&A synergy realization. We believe that Mirion boasts a capable and accomplished senior management team. CEO Tom Logan has been with the company since 2005 and has led the strategy that has grown Mirion’s revenues from $123 million at inception to approximately $700 million currently. The new chairman of Mirion, Larry Kingsley, has a strong history of shareholder value creation as the former CEO of industrial technology leaders Pall Corporation and IDEX Corporation. We think his expertise will be well utilized as Mirion embarks on its next stage of growth.” Another important pro-life company in Ave Maria’s Value Fund portfolio is Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK), whose donations and lobbying funds have shown overwhelming support for the Republicans over the past few years, as evident from the data shared by funding and lobbying data website OpenSecrets.

The company was able to make two large acquisitions at very reasonable prices within its core producing areas, allowing for scale and cost savings. Then in 2022, natural gas prices began to rise well above expectations, increasing the value of Chesapeake’s large natural gas resources and production and contributing to its outperformance.” Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) is another oil and gas stock in Ave Maria Value Fund portfolio that pays dividend and has been getting attention of value investors ever since things started going south in the stock market.
