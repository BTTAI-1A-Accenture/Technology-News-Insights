(Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images) Getty Images American Fred Kerley is about to race on a fourth different continent this year, but the seeds for this season -- and all of his medal-winning seasons -- were planted on the sand, grass and pavement of Grenada. Kerley, the world 100m champion, headlines Friday’s Diamond League meet in Florence, Italy. Peacock streams it live from 2-4 p.m. ET. CNBC airs coverage Saturday at 1 p.m. ET. It was to be a showdown between Kerley and the Olympic 100m champion, Marcell Jacobs of Italy. But Jacobs withdrew on Tuesday due to the nerve pain that has pushed back the start of his outdoor season. Jacobs withdrew from six scheduled races with Kerley dating to May 2022 due to a series of health issues since winning that surprise gold in Tokyo. Kerley, who traded social media barbs with Jacobs earlier this spring, indicated a detente in a press conference Thursday. “I’m not upset that he’s not competing, just wish him health and that he gets back to competing at 100 percent,” he said. When speaking of himself, Kerley kept his trademark confidence. He wore a hat with a goat on it on Thursday and repeated that his focus is on two numbers: 9.69 (Tyson Gay‘s American record in the 100m) and 9.58 (Usain Bolt‘s world record). Kerley’s personal best, in two-plus years since dropping down from the 400m, is 9.76. He resides in South Florida, a place that allows an outdoor athlete to train year-round. Kerley eschews that. He annually flies to Grenada for up to six-week stays. "[I] work on a lot of specific stuff in Grenada to get me to the level I need to be when Budapest comes around,” Kerley said, referring to August’s world championships in the Hungarian capital, where he will bid to become the first man to repeat as world 100m champion since Bolt in 2013 and 2015. Why Grenada? His South Carolina-based coach, Alleyne Francique, competed at three Olympics for the Spice Island, including placing fourth in the 400m at the 2004 Athens Games. That was the best Olympic finish for any Grenada athlete until Kirani James won a 400m medal of every color at the last three Games. Francique recruited Kerley to Texas A&M out of junior college in 2015. When Kerley turned pro in 2017, he moved to the ALTIS training facility in Arizona. After a year, he went back to Francique at College Station -- “It didn’t work out for me. I won’t say anything bad about the program,” he said in 2019, according to Track and Field News. Kerley has since moved to Florida, but Francique still coaches him remotely from South Carolina and with him for meet travel. Kerley has trained in Grenada’s national stadium in St. George’s, which in 2017 was named after James. But a more unique venue for Kerley is a paved hill near the home of one of Francique’s friends. “There’s no traffic, so it’s a good area to train,” Francique said. There are few distractions there, aside from chickens, ducks and cattle. Francique noted that in the three seasons that Kerley trained in Grenada, he won bronze (2019 Worlds 400m), silver (Tokyo Olympic 100m) and gold (2022 Worlds 100m). “So next year, maybe, he breaks a world record,” Francique said. Here are the Florence entry lists. Here’s the schedule of events (all times Eastern): 12:30 p.m. -- Women’s Discus12:45 -- Men’s Triple Jump1:15 -- Men’s Shot Put1:43 -- Women’s Pole Vault2:04 -- Women’s 400m Hurdles2:15 -- Men’s 200m2:20 -- Men’s High Jump2:25 -- Women’s 3000m Steeplechase2:42 -- Women’s Long Jump2:44 -- Women’s 100m2:56 -- Men’s 110m Hurdles3:06 -- Men’s 5000m3:28 -- Women’s 400m3:39 -- Men’s 100m3:49 -- Women’s 1500m Here are five events to watch: Women’s Pole Vault -- 1:43 p.m. ETJust like the Diamond League season opener in Doha, the field has the top five from the last year’s worlds, led by Americans Katie Moon and Sandi Morris, the gold and silver medalists. Moon is the world leader this year indoors and outdoors, though she no-heighted at last Saturday’s Los Angeles Grand Prix. Come August’s worlds, she will look to become the first woman to repeat as world champ in the pole vault in 16 years. Morris, who was third in Doha, eyes her first global outdoor title after four silvers between the Olympics and worlds. Women’s Long Jump -- 2:42 p.m. ETA gathering of the world’s most accomplishes active jumpers -- Olympic and world champion Malaika Mihambo of Germany, Olympic and world medalist Ese Brume of Nigeria -- and the top Americans -- Quanesha Burks and Tara Davis-Woodhall. They’re all chasing 7.08 meters, the world’s best leap this year recorded by Jamaican Ackelia Smith, a University of Texas sophomore. Men’s 5000m -- 3:06 p.m. ETField includes Olympic 5000m champion Joshua Cheptegei of Uganda, Olympic 10,000m champion Selemon Barega of Ethiopia and world silver medalist Jacob Krop of Kenya as well as reigning U.S. 5000m and 10,000m champions Grant Fisher and Joe Klecker. Cheptegei, the world record holder, was ninth at last July’s worlds and since has strictly raced on the roads and in cross country. Men’s 100m -- 3:39 p.m. ETThe entire podium from last year’s worlds meets here: Kerley and countrymen Marvin Bracy-Williams and Trayvon Bromell. It’s a similar field to last Sunday, when Kerley prevailed by five hundredths over South African Akani Simbine. Simbine is back, as is Kenyan Ferdinand Omanyala, who is the world’s fastest man this year (9.84) but was third in Rabat. Women’s 1500m -- 3:49 p.m. ETKenyan Faith Kipyegon, a double Olympic and double world champion, ran the world’s fastest time of 2023 at the Diamond League opener in Doha on May 5. Then last weekend, four different Ethiopians ran faster. Kipyegon figures to be faster in Florence than she was in Doha given the addition of Brit Laura Muir, the Olympic silver medalist and world bronze medalist, in her outdoor season debut.
