Analysts’ Viewpoint  Passenger information systems offer real-time and static information about public transport through visual, audio, or other media. Improved efficiency, effectiveness, and customer satisfaction are the benefits of passenger information systems.  Rise in demand for real-time information and increase in usage of smartphones & internet services are positively impacting the passenger information system market landscape, while urbanization is also playing a vital role in market expansion. On the other hand, high implementation costs and lack of advanced infrastructure to deploy the passenger information system can hinder the growth of the market. The surge in adoption of IoT and cloud technologies are creating lucrative opportunities in the market. Rise in penetration of emerging technologies such as passenger information system software is expected to fuel market progress. Vendors in the market are investing in R&D for technological advancements to provide enhanced passenger information solutions.  Passenger information systems are automated systems that provide real-time information to passengers about the status of public transportation services. Passenger information systems are used to track the location of vehicles, predict arrival and departure times, and provide updates on delays and disruptions. It is also used to improve customer satisfaction, and to plan and increase service usage. Passenger information systems can be implemented in a variety of ways, including on-board displays, station signage, and mobile apps. It is a valuable tool for public transportation agencies, as it helps improve the customer experience and operational efficiency. The number of smartphone devices and internet services is continuously growing. Smartphones have become an integral part of people's lives, and they provide a convenient platform for accessing information on the go. This has resulted in mobile application passenger information system solutions, as it offers passengers a platform for easy and rapid information access. Passenger information systems can be integrated with mobile applications, allowing passengers to access real-time information about their journeys, such as delays, cancellations, and platform changes, besides receiving updates, and personalized notifications directly on their smartphones. The mobile apps provide a user-friendly interface for passengers to check schedules, plan routes, receive alerts, and track the status of their journeys. The convenience and accessibility offered by mobile applications drives the adoption of passenger information systems. Passenger information systems leverage internet connectivity to provide timely and accurate information, ensuring that passengers stay informed and can make informed decisions while travelling. For example, Daitik provides a passenger information mobile application “ iPanel,” which offers passengers the full information related to timetables and delays and other incidents directly on smartphones. The increase in usage of smartphones and internet services has changed the way passengers access information and interact with transportation systems. Passenger information system providers are leveraging mobile-friendly applications to provide real-time updates, personalizing services, integrating ticketing and payment systems, and utilizing data-driven insights. Cloud technologies offer scalable and flexible infrastructure for passenger information system providers. They can leverage cloud platforms to easily scale their systems and resources based on demand. Passenger information system providers can also benefit from the reliability, security, and accessibility offered by cloud services, ensuring seamless operations and improved service availability for passengers. New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport leverages a cloud-based software system to monitor and forecast terminal traffic. The software assists operations personnel in positioning staff and resources to prevent backups at traditional pinch points. It also shares information with resident airlines, TSA, and immigration to help keep traffic moving. IoT technologies enable the integration of various sensors and devices within transportation systems. Passenger information system PIS can leverage IoT devices to collect real-time data on passenger flows, vehicle locations, traffic conditions, and environmental factors. By integrating IoT data with PIS information systems, providers can offer accurate and up-to-date information to passengers, such as real-time arrival and departure times, occupancy levels, and service disruptions. This enhances the overall passenger experience and helps optimize transportation operations. Adoption of big data technologies allows passenger information system providers to analyze large volumes of data collected from various sources, including IoT devices, ticketing systems, and social media. By leveraging big data analytics, passenger information system providers can gain valuable insights into passenger behavior, travel patterns, and preferences, and make data-driven decisions and continuously improve their services. This information can be used to personalize passenger experiences, improve service planning, optimize resource allocation, and enhance operational efficiency. Thus, advanced technologies are creating passenger information system market opportunities and their continuous implementation in public transportation systems is anticipated to fuel the passenger information system market size. According to the latest passenger information system industry research report, North America is expected to dominate the global market during the forecast period. Strong presence of passenger information system vendors, along with high spending on R&D in North America is an important factor driving the market in the region. Besides, a robust public transportation system and network connectivity in the U.S. has increased the demand for passenger information systems.
