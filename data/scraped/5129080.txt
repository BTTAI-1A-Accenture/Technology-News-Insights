 Each month, I share my favourite local stories that showcase the incredible work being done by members of our B.C. tech and innovation community. The objective of these posts is to shine a brighter light on the innovation that’s taking place across this province. Here are the stories from March that caught my eye.   What Happened: Startups from across the province are encouraged to apply for one of North America’s biggest startup competitions. Why We Should Care: Now in its 23rd year, the NVBC Competition is a breeding ground for the province’s most promising startups. Since inception, the competition has supported more than 3,400 BC tech companies that have collectively gone on to create over 8,600 full-time jobs and raise over $1.6B.  Here are some recent Competition alumni that have made significant news over the last year: Certn (Victoria) - 2017 Top Regional Startup Mintlist (Vancouver) - 2021 Competition Winner Cyberdontics (Nelson) - 2018 Runner Up Fable (Vancouver) -- 2020 Third Place Cuboh (Victoria) -- 2019 Third Place Innovate BC is thrilled to support the New Ventures BC Competition once again and continue our partnership of over fifteen years. If you’re an innovator making an impact out of our region, I highly encourage you to take part in this great competition. Applications close on April 11th. Interested startups can apply here. Also, don't miss Innovate BC's upcoming discussion with the 2022 Competition winners on April 4th. Register here.  More on this:   What Happened: Locelle and Scotiabank are teaming up to sponsor 5 BIPOC women with 3 months of mentorship. Why We Should Care: The goal of the initiative is to provide support and guidance to BIPOC women -- who are underrepresented in the tech industry -- and help them advance their careers. Per the release, women hold just 26.7% of tech jobs and only 5% of the leadership jobs within the sector. Through this program, Locelle connects BIPOC women in BC to 1:1 mentorship, resources, and workshops to accelerate their career development and create a pipeline of diverse executives. The Victoria-based company continues to trend upward, as Scotiabank is the latest in a line of partners and customers that includes Microsoft, Vanhack, and Terramera. Locelle boasts a powerhouse roster of mentors, offers monthly roundtables for its program participants, and has created a community where local women can make meaningful business connections. Congrats to Humaira and the entire Locelle team on another impactful partnership. More on this:    What Happened: Female led businesses and organizations dominated headlines this month. Why We Should Care: Every March, female business leaders take the spotlight. This year, we had thought leadership articles, events, and profile pieces that shined a light on our province’s growing community of women entrepreneurs. Here are some of the female-focused stories that caught my eye this month.
