Listen to Story WhatsApp has introduced a new feature that will make it easier for you to transfer chats to a new phone. WaBetaInfo has spotted a new way for transferring messages which lets you restore chats to a new iPhone without using a cloud backup option. A similar feature is already available for Android beta testers. Here are the details. According to the screenshots provided by the source, people will find a new “Transfer Chats to iPhone” option in the app's Settings section > Chats. Here, one will see the ability to transfer chat history to a new iPhone without relying on a iCloud backup. For this, one will just be required to download WhatsApp on their new phone, register with the same phone number, and use the old device to scan the QR code shown on the new phone to transfer their chat history, as per the report. This feature could be very useful for those who run out of cloud storage space pretty fast. For your reference, Apple provides only  5GB of cloud storage space to its users with iCloud. Comparatively, Google gives at least 15GB of free space, which is divided across Google services. Now, one won't be required to use the cloud option to restore chats; however, this feature is not available for everyone right now.Is the feature available for everyone? The cited source says that the new feature that lets you transfer chats to a different iPhone is available to some beta testers. People need to make sure that they are using the latest version of WhatsApp beta for iOS from the TestFlight app if they want to try out the new feature. The report also stated that WhatsApp plans to roll out the new feature to a broader set of audience over the coming days.WhatsApp just launched multi-phone support The platform has introduced the ability to use one WhatsApp account on multiple phones and this is available for the stable version of the app as well. Until now, people were only able to use one account on different devices like desktops and laptops, but not phones. But, this will change with the latest update. You can link your phone to up to four additional devices, just like how you link with WhatsApp on web browsers, tablets and desktops. The linking process is similar to how you connect your one WhatsApp account to different devices. The multi-device sharing feature would be available on WhatsApp’s main page > settings section > Linked devices. You can then simply tap on Link a device and follow the instructions on the screen to enable the feature.Published By: Ankita GargPublished On: May 3, 2023--- ENDS ---Also Read |  Amazon Great Summer Sale starts tonight at 12PM: Big discount on Galaxy M14, iPhone 14, and moreAlso Read |  Amazon employee accidentally captures her layoff live on camera, posts video on TikTok Also Read |  New rule for incoming calling and messages starting today, brings relief from spam calls
