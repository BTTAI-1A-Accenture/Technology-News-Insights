Leading a private college or university remains a highly lucrative job in New Jersey and elsewhere. Two presidents in New Jersey were among 80 in the U.S. who were paid at least $1 million in 2020, according to data compiled by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Former Seton Hall University President Joseph Nyre, who resigned earlier this summer, was New Jersey’s highest-paid college president in 2020 with a total compensation package of $1.27 million, according to the data. Nyre had led Seton Hall since 2019 and was replaced by an interim president, Katia Passerini, for the upcoming school year. Princeton University’s president since 2013, Christopher Eisgruber, received $1.043 million in 2020, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported. The statistics were compiled from the latest available tax forms filed by the private institutions and included 307 presidents and chancellors at 283 colleges with expenditures of $100 million or more, the news site said. Former Thomas Jefferson University President Stephen Klasko was the highest-paid president in the country in 2020, with a total compensation with total compensation of $8.435 million. Thomas Jefferson is a private research university based in Philadelphia. Klasko retired in 2021. Most college presidents have a base pay, but their total compensation is often much higher due to bonuses, deferred compensation packages and other perks and benefits that add to their final paychecks. Here are the six presidents from New Jersey private colleges that made the list based on their 2020 pay:  Joseph Nyre became president of Seton Hall in 2019 and stepped down this summer.
