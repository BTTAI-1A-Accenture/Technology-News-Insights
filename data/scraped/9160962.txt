 This week in ‘Branding Bites’ we are looking at the importance of ‘Brand Colour’. I know most of you will think you have this nailed, but you will surprised how many of you don’t have set colours in your brand and use colours that are ‘near-enough’.  Let’s see why using consistent brand colours is important…    Above, I have shown you a section of of 3 well known brand logos. Even though you can't see the words or the full logo image, you can see the colours - and most of you will be able to distinguish the brands from these colours. This is why colour should not be overlooked in your branding.  For most people, if I showed you a red, you’d probably think of Coca Cola. If I said blue you may think of the NHS. Colours are set in our minds for industry types, food and drink products right through to car manufacturers and charities.   Using set colours as a part of your brand identity really establishes you as a brand. Picking similar colours that ‘are close enough’ doesn’t work if you want your customers or clients to trust you, or if you want your brand to be recognisable and distinguishable from other brands in your industry.  You should use your set brand colours through everything your brand represents. I mean EVERYTHING! If you haven't got your brand colours clarified, do this as a matter of urgency to ensure you create a trustworthy and cohesive brand.   As you can see from these well known brands - colour is vital in creating a memorable and trustworthy brand.   Decide on your 3 main brand colours and clarify the colour references.  Main colour: The primary colour used in the brand. Secondary colour: The second most important colour used in the brand. Accent colour: The third colour used to complement the main and secondary colours.  To find out how to find colour references CLICK HERE  That's all for now. See you next week with another Brand Identity tip that will help you build trust, loyalty and excitement in your brand!  Kindest regards   P.S Did you get the 3 well known logo brands from the image?
