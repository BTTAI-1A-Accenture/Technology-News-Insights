Reviewed Updated: Aug 1, 2024, 2:32pm If you have bad credit, qualifying for a startup business loan might not be challenging. Poor credit can be a red flag to borrowers, who review your credit profile when evaluating your application for a loan. However, it’s possible to find startup business loans for bad credit. Some lenders will work with credit scores as low as 500, while others don’t have a minimum requirement and instead look at your business plan and revenue as a whole.

 650* *See website for details Biz2Credit is a digital funding platform that provides three funding options—term, revenue-based financing and commercial real estate (CRE) loans—ranging from up to $1 million. It only takes a few minutes to apply. Biz2Credit can connect business owners with revenue-based financing Up to $2M+ and term loans up to $1 million. Revenue-based financing payments are flexible based on business performance, with a right to reconcile against actual business receipts while term loans are repaid through weekly, bimonthly or monthly payments over the course of 12 to 36 months. Biz2Credit also offers interest-only CRE loans from Up to $2M+ with terms between 12 and 36 months; payments are due monthly. In the event that Biz2Credit cannot provide a financial product, it may present third-party options to qualified prospective borrowers. However, Biz2Credit confirms that “in the vast majority of cases, [it] will make a financing decision without referral to any external party.” Eligibility Eligibility varies based on the financing option you choose. Term loan Revenue-based financing Turnaround time Biz2Credit does not disclose the turnaround time for its financing options. Expert’s Take Similar to Funding Circle, Biz2Credit emerges as a more balanced alternative and functions as a platform to offer a wide range of loans. Due to the more thorough underwriting process, the qualification requirements are more restrictive than other business lenders and funding may not be as quick. — Abid Salahi, co-founder and CTO, FinlyWealth

 QuickBridge provides small business loans to business owners nationwide. Applying is quick and funding can happen within 24 hours, but you need fair to excellent credit to qualify. Interest on loans from QuickBridge is expressed as a factor rate. To determine the cost of borrowing, multiply your desired loan amount by the factor rate. For example, if you borrow $30,000 at a factor rate of 1.10, you would owe $33,300 in total with $3,300 in interest. With a loan term of six months, your interest rate would be 22%, but that doesn’t include any fees the lender can tack on. Eligibility Turnaround time You can apply and receive a decision from QuickBridge on the same day. Expert’s Take QuickBridge, which operates as an alternative lender, provides small businesses with funding within a matter of days. Its thorough approval process involves looking at your business as a whole, more than just your credit score. However, for approval, there’s a minimum credit score requirement of 600 and an annual revenue requirement of $250,000, which isn’t the lowest in the industry. While the speedy lending process may seem attractive, QuickBridge charges interest as a factor rate starting at 1.10 plus an origination fee in the range of 1% to 5%, making the loans quite pricey. — Abid Salahi, co-founder and CTO, FinlyWealth

 Fundbox is an AI-powered business lending platform that speeds up the application, decision-making and funding process.

Business owners can apply for revolving business lines of credit up to $150,000 with repayment terms of 12 or 24 weeks. Your available credit goes back up as you repay your line of credit. Eligibility Turnaround time With a business line of credit from Fundbox, you can receive your funds as soon as the next business day. Expert’s Take The approval process is quick and Fundbox is available for the credit-challenged business. Credit approvals are usually small, so this [typically] isn’t an option for larger purchases. I had a small business client that had Fundbox integrated with her Stripe dashboard, which made it convenient. — Herman Thompson, Jr., advisory board member

 Kiva is a microlender that offers a unique crowdfunding platform for a wide variety of prospective borrowers. Compared to traditional financing, Kiva utilizes your personal network and its own network of 1.6 million investor lenders to crowdfund loans up to $15,000 with terms up to 36 months. Business owners who apply directly through Kiva’s website may receive 0%	 interest. Kiva refers to these as Direct Loans, which are only available to businesses in the U.S. and social enterprises internationally. However, if a prospective borrower applies through a Kiva Field Partner—local organizations working in communities to vet borrowers, provide services and administer loans—they will likely pay interest to the partner in some form, which varies by partner. Loan funds are distributed and repaid through PayPal or Kiva’s Field Partners. Lender Details  Eligibility Because Kiva uses a crowdfunding method, it’s able to offer less stringent qualification requirements. Although Kiva loans don’t require a minimum credit score, cash flow documents or collateral, borrowers are vetted or endorsed by either a local Field Partner, Trustee or members of the community. Turnaround time After you submit your application, a Kiva representative will get back to you within 10 to 15 business days. Kiva suggests that “submitting a great photo and business story will help your application make it through the review process more quickly.” Once you’re approved for fundraising, you have 15 days to raise funds from your own network, and then 30 days to publicly fundraise with Kiva’s network of lenders. 
 As you shop around for a startup business loan, consider these tips: When you’re borrowing a startup business loan, your business might not have built much of a credit score yet. As a result, your personal credit score will carry greater weight in your application. On the FICO scoring model, a credit score of 580 or below is considered poor. Credit scores of 580 to 669 are considered fair, though applicants with these scores may still be considered subprime borrowers. Some lenders offer bad credit startup business loans to business owners with credit scores starting at 500. Others have higher requirements of 550 or 600. As mentioned, poor or fair credit may mean you get saddled with higher interest rates. You’ll need a good score of 670 or higher to qualify for more competitive rates. Every lender sets its own requirements, but the process of applying for a startup business loan will probably be similar across the board. Here are the general steps you’ll need to take: Every lender sets its own borrowing requirements, so don’t assume that subprime credit will disqualify you from a startup business loan. Here are some types of loans you may be able to obtain: While the lowest interest rates are reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers, you’re not necessarily out of luck if you have bad credit. Your rates may be higher, but it could still be possible to qualify for a startup business loan. Make sure to review your loan offer before borrowing, as you wouldn’t want to take on expensive debt you can’t afford to pay back. Compare your options for startup business loans for bad credit carefully to make the best financial decision for you and your company. We reviewed 16 popular lenders based on 14 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category: Within each major category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms and applicable fees. We also looked at minimum credit score and time-in-business requirements. Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online applications, prequalification options and mobile apps. Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion.
