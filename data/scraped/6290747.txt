If you have lived on planet Earth for the last 120 years, chances are you've heard of Harley-Davidson for being one of the most, if not the most premier motorcycle brands in the world. They have been the ultimate resource for adventure-loving riders all over the globe with bikes designed to fit nearly every kind of lifestyle. Speed-loving adrenaline junkies, laid-back cruiser types, highway-conquering tourers, and everyone else in between, there is a Harley-Davidson out there just for them. Granted that not every Harley has been a winner, as the company has seen plenty of ups and downs throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Some bikes had a very short life expectancy. Others remain in production to this day. And some may be overstayed their welcome. Of course, given its 120-year history, there have been several specific models that have managed to define the history, culture, and future legacy of the brand, as well as motorcycles in general. So let's take a closer look at some of Harley-Davidson's most iconic models that have stood the test of time and remain vital to the motor company's story.

                     If we are going to look at the most iconic Harley-Davidsons ever created, you can bet your gaskets that we're going to bring up the Dyna. First arriving in 1991, the Dyna has been the model of choice for Harley die-hards everywhere. They were affordable, fun, and were blank slates for personal customization. They set the new standard for medium-sized cruisers being able to double as high-performance throttle monsters. The Dyna had multiple additions to the family over the years such as the Street Bob, Low Rider, Wide Glide, Super Glide, Fat Bob, and Switchback. By 2017, the Dyna was retired from Harley-Davidson's production line after the company decided to adopt the current softail design. While many former Dyna models were carried over into the softail lineup, pre-owned Dynas are still considered the model of choice among enthusiasts to this day.

                         The name says it all. The Road King has been the bedrock and foundation of Harley-Davidson's touring class since its was originally introduced as an FL model in 1941, and the first official model arriving in 1994. Designed primarily for comfort, the Road King can handle hours and hours of non-stop riding on the highway for those big cross-country road trips without any fatigue to the rider, as well as provide additional protection with its detachable windshield, storage with its pair of hard saddlebags, and an extra-large saddle with room for two to make it feel like you are riding a couch. Simplicity at its finest, the Road King has everything you need and nothing you don't. Over time Harley-Davidson would introduce its fairing-wearing siblings, the Street Glide and Road Glide into the mix. But the Road King remains the pioneer of the brand's touring class.

                         These days, many Harley riders are unaware of the brand's roots in the racing scene. Thankfully, the XR750 was the bike of choice for many riders that crossed the finish line. According to the American Motorcyclist Association, this was the motorcycle that won the most races in the organization's history. Many of the early models were equipped with a 748cc air-cooled V-twin engine that produced 82 horsepower, and reached a top speed of 115 mph. Fair to say that this bike was already exceeding expectations for a lightweight racer that would be used both on the flat track and in the dirt. Produced from 1970 to 1985, this bike went down in AMA history as the most successful racing motorcycle ever. It was even the same motorcycle Evel Knievel rode until his final jump in 1977.

                         Whether you love it or hate it, there probably hasn't been a Harley with a die-hard cult following as dedicated as the V-Rod. This motorcycle was actually the brainchild of Harley-Davidson's eye for street-style muscle, and the engineering sophistication of Porsche, for a one-of-a-kind cruiser that could dominate the straightaways and have heads turning wherever it went. This low-profile cruiser came with a low seat, forward controls, a large rear wheel, skinny front wheel, a liquid-cooled Porsche engine, and a hidden fuel tank underneath the seat. If someone ever claimed to have seen a bike similar to the V-Rod, they are what you may call "a big fat liar." Because this was the bike of choice for many Harley riders looking to stand out from the pack by riding something out-of-the-ordinary, as well as many sport bike riders transitioning over to the Harley world that didn't want your stereotypical chrome-heavy cruiser.

                     Technically it was known as the EL model, but was later assigned the name "Knucklehead" thanks to the name of the V-twin engine used in the 1930s. Just by looking at it, you are instantly thrown back in time to those old-school Americana days when housewives were setting apple pies on windowsills and the neighborhood kids were out playing baseball. At first, the Knucklehead had a bumpy start as the company rushed to get the motorcycle out to the masses, which resulted in many oil leaks and minor malfunctions. But after some refining, the EL was soon one of Harley-Davidsons most reliable motorcycles that they have ever produced. These days if you see someone riding one of these down the road, you better stop to take a picture because you will probably never see one out in the wild again for a long time as they are highly coveted among collectors and enthusiasts.

                         The successor to the Knucklehead, the Panhead is the embodiment of Harley-Davidson old-school cool. Much like its predecessor, the Panhead earned its name thanks to the tappet placement and upturned pan-shaped valve covers of its engine that was able to produce 60 horsepower in its final years. Produced from 1948 to 1965, the Panhead certainly set the bar high for motorcycle powertrains for almost twenty years as it was the same engine used in Harley-Davidson's Hydra-Glides and Duo-Glides. This amount of power was even more impressive due to the stripped-down design of the bike itself, allowing it to perform at its highest level without any additional weight holding it back. These days, Panheads are also hot ticket items among collectors and enthusiasts, and some will be willing to drop some serious coin in order to get their hands on one.

                         If there was one Harley-Davidson model that perfectly summarized the power, muscle, and machismo of the brand, look no further than the Fat Boy. Viewed as the motorcycle version of a classic muscle car, the Fat Boy was designed to deliver comfortable cruises around down, through the city, and across the highway, all while looking as badass as possible. Known for its signature beefy front and rear tires, this bike had plenty of coverage on the road, and its solid drum-like fenders only added to this bike's masculine energy. Making its debut in 1991, the Fat Boy saw heightened levels of popularity after it was the bike of choice of Arnold Schwartzenegger in the iconic quarry scene from Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Even with over 30 years of production, the Fat Boy remains a staple in Harley-Davidson's lineup today.

                         1957, the motorcycling world saw a major turning point when Harley-Davidson first released the legendary Sportster. This bike has been in production for over 50 years and was the go-to model for a solid, nimble motorcycle that could easily be ridden around down while packing a punch. It was also the clear rival to many British models in the late 1950s and early 1960s, especially Triumph's 650cc Bonneville. As riding technology and engine upgrades progressed over the decades, so did the Sportster as it saw a big jump in displacement from 883cc's to 1000cc's in 1972. These bikes would not see an upgrade to a five-speed transmission until near the end of the 20th century in 1991, following several refreshed variations of itself throughout the decades. Today the Sportster is now the tech-heavy, and throttle-hungry Sportster S, which would make its early predecessors proud of the bike it has grown up to be today.

                     We can thank the King of Rock n' Roll, Elvis Presley, for helping make the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide rise in popularity. First arriving in 1965, the Electra Glide was a beefier-than-usual model that opened the door to more long-distance cruises and touring. Its engine was originally equipped with an electric start before receiving the Shovelhead engine that gave it a 10-percent boost in power, producing approximately 60 horsepower and a top speed nearing 100 mph. Fair to say that the Electra Glide helped open the door to Harley-Davidson's growing touring class that we see today. It remains in production, but with the Milwaukee-Eight 107 cubic-inch engine that produces 77 horsepower, 101 lb-ft of torque, and a top speed of approximately 115 mph. It also comes with a stock batwing fairing with an empty casing for a touch-screen infotainment system that would further transform it into a Street Glide.

                         Back in 1915, it was the second year of the first World War, Woodrow Wilson was the President of the United States, Ford Motor Company produced its 1 millionth Model T, and Harley-Davidson (only 12-years-old) released the Model 11F. While it still looked like an engine-powered bicycle, for its time the 11F was a massive deal. Also considering that it was powered by a 30 cubic-inch V-twin with a three-speed transmission and electrical lighting. For perspective, most motorcycles at this stage only had one speed. Equipping a motorcycle with multiple gears was a major turning point that would propel Harley-Davidson as the leading motorcycle brand that we know today. While the company was still in its adolescent age, it managed to sell 10,000 11F's. Just goes to show you how vast the mass-appeal this brand had in its early years.
