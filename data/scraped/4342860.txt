 Tom DeLonge has declared that Blink-182's forthcoming new album is the best work they've ever done. Last year, the pop punk rockers' most revered line-up reformed, comprised of DeLonge, Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker, with a new single and news of a huge world tour set to kick off in 2023. Part of their huge plans include the release of a brand new album, the trio's first offering since 2011's Neighbourhoods, which will reportedly arrive sometime this year. Blink-182 last released an album in 2019 with Nine, featuring Matt Skiba in replacement of DeLonge. Speaking of the forthcoming new project, the guitarist recently shared via Instagram that it's the greatest work they've ever created. ‚ÄúThis is the best album we‚Äôve ever made,‚Äù he wrote in a post. ‚ÄúBuckle up. I‚Äôm personally tripping and so proud of what we have created TOGETHER. As one unified force of fun, eternal youth, and most of all, close friends.‚Äù The day after the release of new single Edging on October 15, DeLonge said that the record ‚Äúhas some of the most progressive, and elevated music we‚Äòve ever had. In honesty, I am holding my breath for you to hear these other songs. Edging is fun, and a perfect way to remind you of the fun again. But just you fucking wait.‚Äù Barker's drum tech Daniel Jensen also declared last month: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in the studio all week working on the new blink-182 album w/ Travis Barker and it‚Äôs coming out awesome! I really think Blink fans are going to love it.‚Äù The latest news, features and interviews direct to your inbox, from the global home of alternative music. Although no official release date for the album has been announced, DeLonge ¬†promised on his Instagram back in December that it would arrive "over the next few months". Meanwhile, his bandmates have been sharing teaser posts of song lyrics and instrumental parts on their own social media accounts.
