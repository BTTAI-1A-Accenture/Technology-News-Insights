No one likes sitting in traffic so, one Texas city is looking at flying folks over it. Yep, that's the plan. The city of Plano, about 20 miles north of Dallas, can't figure out how to get through or around traffic congestion so they're trying to bring in some super, high-tech gondolas. Plano is the first city in that area of Texas to apply for these things. Apparently, probably after watching what El Paso did, they passed on streetcars. Good for them. The gondolas are made by a company called Swyft Cities, founded by former google peeps. According to their website: 20th century gondolas, meet 21st century technology.
