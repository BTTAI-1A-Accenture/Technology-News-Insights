Jack McDonald: All right, thanks, Mike, we are ready to open the call up for Q&A. Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee. Jeff Van Rhee: Great, thanks, guys. A couple for me. Jack the new growth plan. I think the outline last quarter was that you’re thinking about €15 million spend, for a variety of reasons, just where are you in terms of putting that annualized amount to work namely, what did you get done in Q1 in terms of that spent? Jack McDonald: It’s still early, but we’re moving with urgency. We’ve added a number of folks in digital marketing and STRS and DSRs. So really great energy. And obviously we’re driving see results as soon as we can. Jeff Van Rhee: Yes, I guess what I was saying is just more so if we’re talking three and a half give or take – Jack McDonald: I’m not going to break out the dollar amount that we spent on the growth plan . Jeff Van Rhee: Could you comment on G&A being up from 14 million to 17 million sequentially? Mike Hill: Well, yes, Jeff, this is Mike. Yes, we did have some, some accruals in the quarter on G&A added to bonus accruals. But that was it, those things tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So there’s a little bit of noise in Q1 but that’s wouldn’t . Jeff Van Rhee: Okay, macro conditions, we’re hearing a lot of changes in buyer behavior. What did you observe the end of quarter and since then? Jack McDonald: We were pretty pleased with how the quarter turned out from bookings perspective. So obviously, we’re cautious on outlook because we don’t know what’s coming. But in terms of our Q1 bookings things came in where we were hoping they would come in. But again, what happened to the rest of the year here. Jeff Van Rhee: Okay, that’s it for me. Thanks. Operator: And your last question comes from line of Jake Roberge. Jake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I know there are some moving pieces with the products that need to be sunsetted. But curious how to manage tracking for some of your faster growing products that you talked about looking to prioritize during this transition and just on the macro as well as any product suites that have been more or less prioritized, just given the changing demand environment? Jack McDonald: So I would say that, as I mentioned a moment ago, the demand environment in Q1 came in pretty much as we expected it and we had a relatively good quarter. In that regard we’ll see what the rest of the year brings. We have put in place a plan here to prioritize investment behind those products that we think have the highest growth potential and still too early to report anything there. I will say that we’re seeing some nice activity in our knowledge management products. But again, we see significant opportunities across a variety of our product groups. Jake Roberge: Great. Thanks. And then, is there any update on your plans for M&A? Just given the macro uncertainty and just compressions that we’re seeing in valuations? Are you still actively looking at deals or is that something that’s kind of put on pause until you sunset these products and make that the go to market investments that you’re looking to do over the next year or so? Jack McDonald: We’re definitely still looking at deals. We’re actively in the market. I haven’t seen the price adjustment and private market values that I’d want to see. And of course, we’ve got capital, and we control the timing. So we’re going to be patient and move when it makes sense. But as of right now, I haven’t seen enough of a price adjust super excited, but I’m sure it’s coming. Jake Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. McDonald, you’d like to close. Jack McDonald : Great. All right. Well, thank you so much, and we will see you on the next earnings call. Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.
