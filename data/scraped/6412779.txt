 The car shippers Easy Auto Ship, American Auto Shipping and Montway Auto Transport top Forbes best car shipping companies 2024 list. Easy Auto Ship offers additional insurance coverage up to $100,000, a 30-day price guarantee, and versatile car transport services—including RVs and heavy equipment—across all 50 U.S. states and internationally. Tracking is available for both enclosed and open car transport. We compared the ratings and costs of our top car shipping companies after completing our research and analysis across criteria including pricing and insurance, services, customer support and expert analysis. 	Best Overall Best Overall Easy Auto Ship    Our pick for the best car shipping company overall is Easy Auto Ship with a score of 4.8 out of 5. We love that it accommodates moves for a variety of vehicle types at affordable rates. The company, which was founded in 2013, covers all 50 states and ships internationally. It serves as a broker and vets all its carriers before partnering with them to ship vehicles. Learn more:  Easy Auto Ship review We love that Easy Auto Ship helps put customers at ease with perks like 30-day guaranteed pricing, car rental reimbursement if your shipment fails to arrive within 14 days of the anticipated arrival and even offers a free car wash at delivery. We deducted points because of its lack of a 24/7 customer service line, however. Here are some additional ways Easy Auto Ship stacked up against our methodology: Why We Like It Providing customer protection perks like the ones offered by Easy Auto Ship is a good way to earn points in our detailed company evaluations. The company’s efforts to protect the consumer by offering additional insurance in the absence of carrier claim coverage, a pricing guarantee and a free rental car or car wash if delivery fails to meet standards land Easy Auto Ship in our number one spot. What We Don’t Like There’s little that we didn’t like about Easy Auto Ship. However, we’d like to see the company add some additional services, such as an all-hours customer service line and guaranteed pick-up dates that don’t require paying an upcharge fee. Who It’s Best For Easy Auto Ship’s customer base covers a wide demographic. We recommend using the company for both long and short-distance vehicle moving, open or enclosed. While Easy Auto Ship’s average pricing quotes came back slightly higher than those of some of its competitors, we feel the company’s price guarantee and lack of hidden fees justified the difference. The online estimated costs and discounted cash payment prices are listed below. Easy Auto Ship’s website offers instant online pricing estimates. We found that Easy Auto Ship has overwhelmingly positive customer reviews, with satisfied customers raving about the company’s frequent and detailed communication as well as its commitment to operating on the scheduled timeline whenever possible. Like all companies, Easy Auto Ship does have a small amount of negative reviews (but again, a majority are positive). These reviews mention some scheduling snafus and issues with some drivers that the company works with. Navigating Easy Auto Ship’s website, we found more than enough information on the landing page and through the primary menu. Scrolling to the bottom of the page revealed an FAQ section containing quite relevant and common inquiries, which we thought were especially helpful. Obtaining an instant quote was simply a matter of inputting a few details about our destination and automobile in the front page form. We received our quote and an email within seconds stating our initial price, shipping details and our cash-discount option. When I first researched transporting a car, I didn’t realize I could choose between a broker who finds a vetted driver from their network or a car carrier company that directly transports your vehicle with their own drivers. There’s also a third option, a broker/carrier hybrid. Each type has pros and cons, so make sure you research the company’s practices to pick the best option for you.
– Dawn M. Smith 	Best Coverage Best Coverage SGT Auto Transport    We chose SGT Auto Transport as the best coverage because we believe it is a good car shipping option, especially if you’re shipping a car to another state. Its price-matching helps you find the best price to ship a car and it offers exact pick-up dates to make shipping easier. SGT Auto Transport is a broker, but it has an extensive network of carriers to accommodate your move. Learn more:  SGT Auto Transport review We like that SGT Auto Transport is available nationwide and offers price matching. We took off points because it doesn’t offer shipment tracking. Below, we broke down a few other factors and how SGT stacked up against our methodology: Why We Like It Our detailed research uncovered a lot to like about SGT Auto Transport. However, our favorite features included customer comforts, such as precise pick-up dates and various discounts for students and military personnel. What We Don’t Like SGT Auto Tranport’s review wasn’t completely ding-free. We discovered that the company offers no precise shipment tracking for its customers and it lacks a terminal-to-terminal shipment option, both of which can limit usefulness to customers. Who It’s Best For We recommend SGT Auto Transport for transporting a vehicle any distance because of the perks the company offers. However, we noticed the company offered a lower price quote for short-distance moving of 500 miles or less than any of its competitors in our review. For this, and other, reasons, SGT may be the best of the best for shorter-distance, door-to-door vehicle transporting. The online estimated costs and discounted cash payment prices are listed below. SGT Auto Transport’s website offers instant online pricing estimates. We found that SGT Auto Transport has very positive reviews, many of which mention quick deliveries without issues and reasonable prices for car shipping. There are bound to be some negative experiences with any company, though, and more critical reviews of the company mention car delivery delays and lack of communication. Our SGT Auto Transport good vibes started almost as soon as we navigated to the company’s website. While it’s a busy site, we found all of the important information immediately available, including a helpful How it Works tab and an ever-present, Get a Free Quote tab. Also nice to see was a menu selection dedicated to identifying one of the company’s pricing deals that best fit our situation. Choosing the Get a Free Quote tab took us to a selection page to choose from a few shipping options. After choosing, we were presented with a few more choices designed to get us the best deal. Finally, we reached the input pages. The site asked several questions to ensure an accurate quote and provided our numbers at the end. Keep in mind that many brokers require a final cash payment paid directly to the driver or carrier. Plan to have cash or certified funds on hand on the delivery date. Some drivers might accept payment platforms like Venmo, but you’ll need to verify their policies.
– Dawn M. Smith 	Best Value Best Value American Auto Shipping    We chose American Auto Shipping for best value because it is one of the few auto shipping companies we researched that does not require a deposit. The broker offers a good value with its pricing among the companies on this list, too. You can also find a personal concierge to help with the details of your move. Learn more:  American Auto Shipping review We chose American Auto Shipping for our list because of great qualities like its lack of a deposit requirement and its personal concierge service. We deducted points for factors like its lack of 24/7 tracking. Here is some further detail about the points we awarded American Auto Shipping via our methodology. Why We Like It Customer service, pricing, service options and satisfaction reports are key factors in our review process. Our American Auto Shipping company evaluation started checking off boxes when we learned that it required no deposit to secure your shipping date. It continued checking boxes as we discovered its tiered pricing structure, which allows consumers to essentially choose their price according to their delivery speed. Both of those features, and more, fared well in our scoring model. What We Don’t Like The only real downsides we found regarding working with American Auto Shipping were its lack of international shipping options and its inability to offer around-the-clock shipment tracking for its customers. Who It’s Best For Auto shipping customers seeking domestic vehicle transport at reasonable prices with the option of upgrading the contract terms for a few more dollars are most likely to appreciate the value offered by American Auto Shipping. The online estimated costs and discounted cash payment prices are listed below. American Auto Shipping’s website offers instant online pricing estimates. American Auto Shipping is another car shipping company with overall positive reviews and looking into its ratings on sites like the BBB and Trustpilot indicates many satisfied customers. But like all companies, there are some negative reviews on its profiles, including ones that mention damages and delays in delivery times. “Consider adding a Bluetooth tracking device, like an AirTag, to your car so you’ll always know its location along the route.”
— Dawn M. Smith  Sorting through long FAQ lists is one way to learn about a company. Fortunately, while an FAQ page exists on the company’s site, American Auto Shipping’s website made finding the information we were looking for much easier than that. Everything we needed to know to make an informed decision about using American was right in the drop-down primary menu on the landing page. We really appreciate that the page provided the information in terms we could understand. It assumed we knew little and provided details without being condescending. We obtained our Free & Instant quote directly from the form on the site’s front page. “For those considering using American Auto Shipping, I recommend double-checking the insurance coverage options. Ensure that the coverage provided aligns with your needs, especially if you’re shipping a high-value vehicle. Additionally, prepare your vehicle for shipping by cleaning it and documenting its condition with photos as a precaution.”
— Pradeep Guragain  	Best Pricing Best Pricing Sherpa Auto Transport    We chose Sherpa Auto Transport as the best for pricing because it sets itself apart from other car shipping brokers with its Price Lock Promise. This policy means the quote you receive from Sherpa is what you pay. While other shipping brokers offer price guarantees, we like that Sherpa takes it a step further by providing up to $300 of its own money if additional funds are needed to secure a carrier. Learn more:  Sherpa Auto Transport review We chose Sherpa Auto Transport in part because of its commitment to finding customers the best deal and its nearly nationwide coverage. We deducted points because of its lack of international shipping. Below, we broke down some important features of Sherpa Auto Transport and how it stacks up against our methodology: Why We Like It Backing up promises is a feature some companies provide that always scores well with our research team. While we like Sherpa Auto Transport for several reasons, including its partner vetting and customer feedback ranking system, the details of its Price Lock Promise really stood out from its competitors. What We Don’t Like There are just a couple of tweaks we’d like to see Sherpa Auto Transport make to earn an even higher score in our review. We’d like to see some international shipping options or partnerships to widen its demographic. We’d also like to see the company improve its tracking ability to include GPS services to help keep customers’ minds at ease. Who It’s Best For Customers looking to get their car from here to there on a budget without sacrificing customer service will likely find what they need through Sherpa Auto Transport. While Sherpa doesn’t offer rock-bottom prices, it does provide competitive quotes that are guaranteed not to change due to minor cost fluctuations. The online estimated costs and discounted cash payment prices are listed below. Sherpa Auto Transport’s website offers instant online pricing estimates. We found that Sherpa Auto Transport has largely positive reviews, with happy customers mentioning the company’s on-time service and good communication. On the other hand, as with all companies, there are some critical reviews. In our research, we found that many of these reviews mention late pick-ups and drop-offs or poor communication. One of the questions that potential customers report having is how to choose a transport company based on specific needs. For example, what service do I need if I’m shipping a car to purchase it or if I’m shipping a car to relocate my life for work? It sounds simple, but many car shipping companies’ websites fail to address the question upfront. We navigated to Sherpa Auto Transport’s website to obtain a quote. The process was simple and not particularly noteworthy, which is good. However, a tab called Who We Help on the landing page caught our attention. Hovering over the button revealed 11 selections with titles like Auto Auction Buyers, College Students, Snowbirds, etc., that told us precisely where to look for the services that would best fit our shipping needs. If you think you might save money by filling your vehicle with boxes of belongings, think again. Most companies require emptying your vehicle to ensure the transport truck stays under federally regulated weight restrictions. The company will also likely ask that your gas tank be about ¼ full on loading day.
– Dawn M. Smith 	Best Service Best Service Montway Auto Transport    We chose Montway Auto Transport as the best service because it has operated as a vehicle shipping broker for nearly 20 years and has established itself as one of the best in the industry. The company has built a network of more than 30,000 carriers to help accommodate customer moves, including some of the best interstate moving companies. Learn more:  Montway Auto Transport review Montway has many qualities that helped it make our list, including nationwide service, guaranteed delivery dates and transparent pricing. We did take away points for things like its lack of binding quotes, though. Here are more details about how Montway Auto Transport scored against our methodology: Why We Like It We like Montway Auto Transport for its willingness to back up its subcontract carriers with its own insurance policy. It’s not just nice to have, but also an excellent business practice. Additionally, Montway stands out from the crowd by offering a relatively simple online tracking feature so customers can check in on their vehicles occasionally. What We Don’t Like While our detailed review process uncovered very competitive pricing offered by Montway, we were surprised to learn that the company didn’t provide a price guarantee or even a binding quote option. The company lost several points in our review for those omissions. Who It’s Best For We recommend Montway Auto Transport to customers who value on-time deliveries at reasonable, although not guaranteed, prices. The company offers discounts for military personnel, multiple vehicle shippers, return customers and customers willing to pay cash. The online estimated costs and discounted cash payment prices are listed below. Montway Auto Transport’s website offers instant online pricing estimates. Montway has largely positive customer reviews, with many customers praising the company’s intuitive website, helpful customer service and adherence to scheduled delivery times. When it does get more critical reviews, customers seem to mention issues with getting in touch with Montway and service delays. We found Montway Auto Transport’s website to be a little busy. While we found the information we were looking for to help us decide which service we needed, finding it quickly didn’t happen. We got the best results and the most helpful information from the first two tabs on the landing page. The How It Works and For Individuals tabs provided drop-down menus with descriptions that were easy to understand. The company places its quote contact form boldly on the first page, making that part of the journey extra simple. After visiting many car shipping company websites, we really appreciated that Montway’s site didn’t annoy us with an overbearing chatbot pop-up found on some of its competitors’s sites. The chatbot simply existed in the lower corner, ready to help if we needed it. Most car transport companies offer a range of possible delivery dates instead of a specific date. If you need a set date, you must confirm with the company that they can meet your requirements. Your transport company should include your delivery date in your contract.
– Dawn M. Smith 	Best Discounts Best Discounts AmeriFreight    Our pick for best discounts is AmeriFreight because it is a car shipping broker that likes to appeal to people with its discounts. You won’t find steep savings but every little bit can help if you’re moving cross-country. The company can accommodate a variety of moves, including any recreation vehicles through open or enclosed shipping. Learn more:  AmeriFreight review AmeriFreight is a solid car shipping company that carefully vets its carriers, which is one of the reasons it made our list. However, we deducted points for a few reasons, including that it doesn’t offer binding quotes. Here are some factors we included in our methodology and how AmeriFreight stacked up: Why We Like It Putting customer needs first is a big-points plus in our company reviewing standards. Our researchers noted that AmeriFreight stands out by providing its customers with numerous vehicle shipping solutions at reasonable prices and protecting them with its gap insurance coverage protections. What We Don’t Like AmeriFreight could increase its already excellent score in our review by offering just a couple more things, including an always-on customer service line and binding price quotes. Who It’s Best For We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend AmeriFreight to anybody needing to transport almost any kind of vehicle. However, customers eligible to receive the company’s best deals include military members, first responders, medical personnel, students and seniors. The online estimated costs and discounted cash payment prices are listed below. AmeriFreight’s website offers instant online pricing estimates. AmeriFreight generally gets very positive customer reviews. Satisfied customers praise the overall car shipping process with the company and the knowledge of the customer service staff. We found that in critical reviews, customers tend to mention late deliveries and communication problems like not hearing back from the company in a timely manner. AmeriFreight’s website is similar to many other car-shipper sites. It provides a lot of information, but much of it is quite vague. On the front page, we found general situation descriptions that will affect cost, but not by how much. We dug deeper in the How it Works tab to discover more of the same vagueness. However, to be fair, this feature isn’t unique to AmeriFreight. What we did find helpful was the company’s large, bold free-quote input form on every page and a chat function that stayed in the corner without popping up too often. We simply entered our vehicle and destination information, made a few other selections and received a quote within seconds. Regardless of which type of car transport company you choose, you should familiarize yourself with the required deposits and payments.
– Dawn M. Smith Picking the best car shipping company for your move means doing some research to understand the industry and the costs involved. You can begin with a broad search and begin to narrow down your list by looking at individual companies and their reputations. It’s important to look at things like insurance coverage in the event something goes wrong and you have to file a claim. Moving is already a headache and the last thing you want to do is deal with the hassle of an insurance claim and a dispute with a carrier. You can easily get quotes from car shipping brokers to help you set a budget for your move. Once you’ve got a number in mind, you can narrow your search to find the best car shipping company for you. Booking well in advance and outside of peak seasons (which are typically summer and in the new year) will also allow you to have more carrier options and help you save on costs. If you familiarize yourself with the charges you’ll see with shipping a car, you can start to make better decisions for your move to save costs. Do not choose a car shipping company based on the lowest prices alone. If the price estimate is too good to be true, that may, unfortunately, be the case, and you won’t want to find out when the customer service and treatment of your vehicle suffer because of a company’s questionable ethics. Hidden costs are a bugaboo of the car shipping industry with customers often complaining about a higher bill than their quote once their vehicle is dropped off. If possible, seek a binding quote so there are no surprises. You can also ask pointed questions during the quote process so you know what to expect. Be aware that shippers can require a cash payment or certified check at the time of delivery. Many carriers will offer free online quotes, but to get the most complete pricing estimate, you’ll need to provide the auto transport company with specific details about your vehicle and shipment plan, including your projected dates, drop-off and pick-up locations as well as whether you will be transporting in an open or enclosed trailer. If you want to leave any personal items in your car, this would also be a good time to ask about that. If you don’t do your research or ask the carrier what additional factors may affect the total, there may be hidden fees that you aren’t made aware of until it’s too late. Reviews through Google and the BBB can help give you a picture of a company’s reputation and customer service. Poor reviews can provide insight into how a business handles service issues. You can also learn how long a company has operated and get an idea of how many cars it ships by the number of reviews it has received. Shipping your car with a company that has decades of experience can bring peace of mind. A well-established business can also tap into a wide network of carriers to help you find the best deal. Brokers with more experience can have better infrastructure to help with your move than younger companies. More brokers have emerged in the past decade or so as they’ve leveraged data and technology to help find deals. Younger companies can be a bit more nimble. Guaranteed quotes or price locks can help make you feel more comfortable with a broker. Estimates can vary from the final bill and lead to customer complaints. A company that offers transparent pricing can make shipping your car easier. Carriers are required to carry a specific amount of insurance to be on the road. Some brokers will offer additional insurance coverage or they’ll have deductible reimbursement should a carrier not cover a claim. Brokers that offer additional insurance coverage can appeal to you more than those that don’t. If you choose to go with a carrier directly to ship a car, they can also offer additional insurance coverage. Your car insurance may not be sufficient for all of the things that could happen during car transport. If anything goes wrong at any point in the process—weather delays, a rock hitting your windshield, a collision on the interstate, theft, accidental damage to your vehicle while handling and more—you’ll want to be fully protected from liability. It’s worth it to extensively review all insurance policies available and purchase extra if there’s a loophole in your plan. Shipping a car is a process and communication is key. Researching car shipping companies can mean looking at how they interact with customers. Features like live chat or a 24/7 customer service line can set businesses apart and provide assurances that your vehicle will arrive on time. Companies that have transparent pricing can appear more trustworthy than those that have opaque pricing. You’ll want to understand all the charges you’ll incur with a move before you choose a company to avoid any surprises. When you’ve narrowed down the options, verify the professionalism and credentials of your top auto shipping companies. Check to make sure your auto shipper is qualified to operate transporting automobile cargo in interstate commerce with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) registration, complete with a USDOT and an MC number. You can explore local car shippers in your city to find a company that fits your needs or discover national auto transporters who service your state. Car Shipping Companies By State  The cost to ship a car across the country varies from as low as $550 to as high as $2,450. Nationally, the average cost to ship a car is about $1,150. On a per-mile basis, that breaks down to $0.60 to $1.70 per mile with an average cost of $1.15 per mile. The actual amount will vary based on the options you choose, mode of transport, discounts and fuel costs. We did the research: Forbes Home gathered quotes for shipping a sedan from New York City to Los Angeles, a distance of 2,790 miles, to determine the average cost of shipping a car. Get Your Free Moving Estimate Receive a custom quote from a Car Moving Company today that's designed to meet your needs and budget by clicking on your state. Several factors impact the cost of transporting a car but distance and shipping options play the biggest roles. Options like choosing an enclosed shipment versus an open shipment can add significant costs to a move. Factors like your location, type of vehicle, options, shipping length and the season you choose to move will affect the cost of shipping a car. Enclosed car shipping is exactly what it sounds like—a method of shipping a vehicle that’s safe and fully enclosed on a trailer. The other option, open car shipping, is what you’ll often see on the highway when an 18-wheeler truck has seven or eight cars stacked precariously atop the trailer bed. Often, people will select the enclosed method when they’re transporting a classic car, a high-end luxury vehicle, or simply one that they don’t want to run the risk of getting dinged, dirty or damaged. Enclosed trailers are typically smaller than an open bed and can’t accommodate as many cars: often only two to three cars can be transported at once. This leads to what is perhaps the biggest drawback of enclosed car shipping: the price. This method of shipping can cost twice that of an open carrier. Considering having your car shipping in an enclosed car shipping trailer? You’ll first want to consider the pros and cons involved. Get Your Free Moving Estimate Receive a custom quote from a Car Moving Company today that's designed to meet your needs and budget. Shipping a vehicle isn’t a common occurrence for most people. The car-shipping process involves numerous variables and can quickly become confusing even if you’re familiar with how it works. Here are some essential things to know about using a car transport company. Car shipping quotes seldom equal the final price you pay to ship a car. Most often, you’ll receive an estimate from your auto shipper, and the final amount due will be made clear after the car reaches its destination. Providing as much information as possible to the shipping company will minimize, if not eliminate, unpleasant final bill surprises. Unless the timing of your shipment is specifically laid out in the contract, the time it takes to move your car is approximate. The dates given are the earliest your auto will be picked up and the latest it may be delivered. Your bill of lading will specify details, including the timing and shipment details, while also acting as a receipt and a contract. Whether you use the shipping company’s standard insurance, buy extra protection from them or provide your own insurance, protect yourself and your auto by understanding what’s covered in the policy before your shipper picks up your vehicle. Be sure to document the condition of your car in as much detail as possible before you hand your cargo off to the auto transport company. Take pictures and record any known damages, then assess again when your vehicle is returned. If the car shipping company is responsible for any dents or dings, it should take full responsibility, but it may be impossible to prove the damage that happened from transport if you don’t have a record ahead of time. The bill of lading is one of the most important documents involved in the car shipping process. It is essentially the contract between you and your chosen car shipping company, as well as a receipt for your transaction. Be sure to look at it carefully when you ship your car and when you receive your shipment and be sure all your info is accurate, including any notes about the condition of the car. You’ll also want to make sure your vehicle is clean and ready according to that company’s terms and conditions. It’s also best to have proper documentation to verify the expectation of services and your own proof of vehicle ownership and insurance coverage. Despite some misconceptions, open trailer vehicle shipping is a safe way to move your car at a lower cost than an enclosed trailer. However, if you’re shipping a high-value automobile, it may be worth the added protection and peace of mind to pay more for an enclosed shipment.

             Receive a custom quote that's designed to meet your needs and budget. To find a reputable transport company, start your search on review sites and ask acquaintances about their experiences using similar companies. You can make price comparisons online, but contacting each company can give you a better understanding of what services they provide and how upfront they are about pricing. Avoid companies that are reluctant to offer pricing information and specific details. Also, ask about their insurance and licensing and how they insure your shipment. The best way to ship a car depends largely on what you need to accomplish. For moving the family car inexpensively you may simply consider having a top moving company do the job. The most common and least costly way to ship a car is by open transport trailer. However, you can determine the best way to transport your car by deciding what factors are most important to you. If you require the best protection for your car, choose an enclosed trailer, or select freight shipping to get your car overseas at the best price. In many cases, people ship collector cars, or specialty cars, that require extra care. In these situations, saving money may take a backseat to personal attention. Hiring specialty automobile movers, dedicated to the cause, may be the best option. The actual duration of shipping a car is typically just a few days. However, the total time from pick up to delivery can be anywhere from two weeks to around 30 days.
