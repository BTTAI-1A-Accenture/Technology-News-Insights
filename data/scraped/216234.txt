One of them for example was Chloé Colas, who opened her shop L’Hexagone in Greenwich Market, London last year. She joined the programme in May 2022 and was supported by her Ankorstart expert from that moment on, even after her shop opened in September 2022. We supported her during her retail journey, from onboarding to obtaining an EORI number to guidance on building a balanced assortment that can attract and satisfy the customers while ensuring profitability. She was very happy about her experience with the programme and shared that her retail expert has been a blessing for her. She felt and is still feeling very supported.
