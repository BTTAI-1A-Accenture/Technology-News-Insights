 These are my thoughts & summarized learnings about 12 key aspects of Hyper Scalar Transformation (HST) which all large enterprises are into now for moving their On-Prem Legacy ERP systems functionality and Data into Cloud. I was among the few lucky people in my current organization being part of this HST as the Reporting, Archival, Advanced Analytics and Full Stack Home Grown Solutions IT leader (Day#1 to End of the Program). I had crafted this newsletter approach to share these learnings in 12 parts across 2 weeks so as to reduce the burden of reading a long article at one go. I will summarize the 12 aspects as the 13th Day article to have a complete 360 degree view. Today I am going to share the 10th Key aspect "Program Management, Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC)". i.	Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) and Program Management are as important as any other functional modules capabilities in the hyper scaler transformations. This has the power to derail the program if not paid adequate attention ii.	Security aspects should be planned, designed, and implemented in the lines of “Secure by Design” in DevSecOps way. Being a passionate cyber security volunteer for more than a decade and an adopter of DevSecOps in my product teams, institutionalizing the DevSecOps helps you refining Security at the core covering People, Process and technology layers effectively and efficiently iii. While DevSecOps implementation part can be handled effectively by the Cloud Product and their attached service teams, Security team should be adequately staffed with passionate Cyber Security Advisors so that these skills can be well managed through out its digital thread (Product Life Cycle Management - PLM) iv. Security Strategy should ensure complete process coverage in terms of three steps via a swim lane or process flow approach. Security means overall security of the cloud product. Data and People (Subject and Object) with an established Security Process Matrix layout           i.	Security of data at rest           ii.	Security of data during processing/computing           iii.	Security of data while moving v. Security of the Cloud Product should contain three below non-negotiable functionalities perfectly covered;             i. Organization/Enterprise Integrated Single Sign-on (SSO)             ii. Policy Profiles Development (People Personal Profile and Role with pre-defined Privileges) and Enforcement Layer. It can be internal to the cloud product or external product talking to Cloud and various similar systems for the Organization             iii. Strong Audit Logging for all roles and review mechanism for the privileged roles activities periodically vi. Program Management Office (PMO) - Better the program management, better will be the outcome with efficiency. PMO to take care of collating the overall project plan, conducting Governance meetings, manage finances, manage on-boarding and offboarding process and handle partners relationship with payments coordination till launch vii. PMO can also handle Testing team in few scenarios, various environments management, UAT coordination with business & Sign-off based on the resource capability. PMO should report to Executive Sponsors of the program to ensure right visibility and positioning viii. PMO can provide systems platform for communication, collaboration, tools for program & change management, RAID (Risks, Actions, Issues and Decisions) management and Governance meetings at three levels (L1, L2 & L3). PMO should cover both IT and Business and this way it will blur the lines of conflict to greater extent. PMO Function can be owned by IT or Business or an independent Organization within the company or outsourced. My preference will be either IT or Business owned PMO function will be quite effective. Bottom-line will be the leader and the team who are supporting create the value what it asks for. Whilst L3 handles at primary level against program/project plan where all individual module leads come and present, L2 handles Key leader’s summary to overall Program Leader includes financial performance briefing. Finally, L1 is for Executive sponsors. Best cadence for L3 would be weekly, while L2 at once in 2 weeks and L1 once a month and HST should be focused to accomplish their epics by 18-24 months and if that is taking longer time, break down or run parallel epic driven programs with an individual focus. PMO should be seen as an investment for deriving the better value from the program than non-functional cost ix. PMO can handles finances may be the general procedure. The better way is to keep it simple as one stop shop for all expenses including Capital and Expense reporting to Finance controller's Office. Qualified project management finance professionals are the key for this work with a backup plan clearly charted out. Ad-hoc needs, tasks (project money cuts), Invoice approvals, Time & Manhours approvals, earned value alerts, and travel coordination can be effectively performed by PMO.  x. Beyond PMO and GRC, Organization Change Management is also important for large programs which should be generally lead by business. They drive by getting nomination from all skill team leads in the organization for SPOCs to carry the new change system information to their skill teams at grass root level seamlessly along with organizing training for the end users. Let's talk in the next edition about 11th Key aspect "Reporting & Advanced Analytics". Thanks for your time and please share your feedbacks and thoughts.
