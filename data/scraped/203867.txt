Pitt Ohio Transportation Group has made a minority investment in residential delivery provider Aria Logistics, the company announced Feb. 13.
                

The Pittsburgh-based transportation, warehouse and logistics services provider became interested in the company because of its final-mile technology capabilities as well as its leadership, drivers and customer base. Pitt Ohio also cited potential advantages to its own services in making the investment.
                

Aria Logistics has specialized in large-format residential delivery services since 2014. That includes home appliances, furniture, fitness equipment and large electronics. It expanded nationwide after starting in New York City. The company provides services that include curbside, threshold, room of choice and white glove delivery.
      	    






Pitt Ohio said in the announcement that the delivery service will benefit from its expertise in safety, vehicle maintenance and human resources. Aria Logistics will continue to operate as a separate last-mile delivery company. SJ Consulting Group was retained to help broker the proposed transaction.
