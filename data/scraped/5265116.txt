Individual plaques dedicated to fallen officers were missing pictures, and names had been scratched out. Schmautz called the destruction "startling and ugly" and said whoever is responsible for it is foolish and shortsighted. "As a current member of Honor Guard, my heart is dismayed at such a cowardly and foolish act. The Police Memorial stands as an enduring reminder of the ultimate sacrifice paid by heroes in Portland who gave their lives to defend strangers in our community. Each of these individuals are also etched on the wall of the national memorial in Washington DC.," Schmautz said.

This ugly criminal act seeks only to fuel divisive and destructive rhetoric that is not representative of who we are as a city.
