 MacBook deals are on fire right now. Retailers like Amazon and Best Buy are offering some of the best MacBook deals of the year. Plus, with back to school sales happening now, there's never been a better time to update your MacBook.  That said, fall is when Apple is expected to refresh its laptops and new M4 MacBook Pros could be on the horizon. Nevertheless, if you're looking for epic value — now is your time to buy.  For a limited time, Amazon has MacBooks on sale from $799. It's one of the best MacBook sales we've seen. This week's deals include the recently released MacBook Air M3. Available in 13-inch (from $1,099) and 15-inch (from $1,299) sizes, the laptops are undergoing massive discounts.  So if you spot a deal you like — our advice is to jump on it immediately because stock tends to run out fast. If you don't see the listed sale price, try checking different color models for hidden deals. (For more deals, make sure to follow our best Apple deals guide). Also, make sure to check out our guide on the best Apple coupons and best MacBooks for college students.  MacBook Pro 14 (M3/512GB): was $1,599 now $1,399 @ Amazon

However, Amazon usually countered the price and offered it for all consumers.  16-inch MacBook Pro M3 Pro: The priciest MacBook in Apple's lineup has hit an all-time price low of $2,199 at Amazon. While it's rare to find this price, it's not completely uncommon, so if you can wait it out — we'd recommend waiting for a major retail holiday before buying this machine.  Previous gen 13-inch MacBook Air M1: It's the oldest MacBook still available, but it's an amazing value. Powered by an M1 CPU, it offers just enough muscle for everyday work. It's selling for $699 at Walmart regularly. (It hit $649 very briefly at Best Buy, but we haven't seen that price since).   13-inch MacBook Air M2: The Editor's Choice MacBook Air M2 has hit an all-time price low of $829 a few times this year. Amazon is usually the retailer to offer this price, but we recommend checking Best Buy or B&H Photo for this price point as well. It's the best MacBook value hands down.  15-inch MacBook Air M2: The 15-inch MacBook Air M2 has hit an all-time low of $999. Even the model with 16GB of RAM dropped to $1,399 ($300 off). It usually sells for $1,049 or $1,099. However, stock is running low and seeing this deal is very rare. It's also worth noting that sometimes pricing varies based on what color MacBook you choose. So when shopping, we recommend clicking on different colors to see if there are hidden discounts. Also, check out our list of the best Mac VPN and how to check MacBook battery health.
