The
New Zealand team is ready to march into the Olympiastadion
in Berlin for the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics
World Summer Games, along with 7000 other athletes from 180
countries.The New Zealand Special
Olympics athletes and their support staff could hardly
believe what they were witnessing at the Opening Ceremony
for the World Summer Games in Berlin this morning.The
39 athletes and their 22 support staff marched into the
historic Olympiastadion along with 7000 athletes from 180
delegations to be welcomed by a boisterous crowd of 80,000,
including several family members from New Zealand, for a
spectacular Opening Ceremony show.“As long as we
all live, we will never forgot what we experienced here,”
said Rowena Massey, Head of the New Zealand
Delegation.“Everything has just been next level at
these games, so far, and the Opening Ceremony just blew
everyone away.”The German hosts put on a stunning
show of colour, dance and music that included a two-hour
long parade of the participating team, starting as per
tradition with the delegation of Greece, and finishing with
the largest team at the games from the home nation of
Germany.The biggest cheer however was reserved for
the small delegation of Ukraine athletes who managed to
attend despite the ravages of war in their home
nation.Footballer Conor McCarthy from Hutt Valley
said the ceremony was “amazing” and like most of the
80,000 in the stadium decided the closing fireworks were
“just awesome”.



Television viewers in nearly 200
countries, including New Zealand, witnessed the athletes
march into the same stadium where legendary American athlete
Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympic
Games.Global broadcaster ESPN has committed a huge
delegation to the games and will cover most events,
including 20 cameras each at athletics and swimming. During
the opening ceremony, the broadcaster interviewed
Taranaki’s Melissa Cash and her uncle/coach Nigel who
became the first Special Olympics athlete to attend the
World Summer Games as an athlete and as coach.Each
country also brought a small sample of water from their home
and bocce player Aaron Campbell from Horowhenua was invited
to pour the Kiwi water into a river at the heart of the
stadium to represent the unity between the
nations.The World Summer Games have grown from their
modest start in 1983 to become the largest inclusive sports
event on the planet with 7000 athletes competing across 26
sports, supported by 18,000 volunteers and over 300,000
fans.The New Zealand delegation will now be able to
turn their attention to their competitions after a week-long
training camp and Host Town festivities near Munich. To
demonstrate just how close the team and their German hosts
had become, two of the mayors from Bavaria involved in
hosting the Kiwis, were even invited to join them marching
in for the opening ceremony parade.The team spent the
past few days since arriving in Berlin getting familiar with
the venues where they will compete across nine
sports.The first Kiwis in action on Monday morning
(NZT) will be swimmers Jesse Williams (Manawatu) and Bella
Lammers (Canterbury), who will compete at the Europapark
Schwimm und Sprunghalle, the largest pool complex in
Europe.On the outside athletics track at the
Olympiastadion, Quentin Mahoney (Wellington) will run the
1500m heats, while Matt Di Leva (Wellington), Josh Taylor
(Wairapapa), and Natasha Chang (Howick) will compete in the
200m heats. Chang has a busy first day as she also competes
in the 50m sprint heats.Next to the athletics venue,
the New Zealand football team will open their campaign
against Egypt.“I hope they don’t have Mo Salah
playing tomorrow,” laughed Finn McNally from
Waikato.The Liverpool star may not compete in Berlin,
but several New Zealanders will line up with some global
super stars in basketball and football as part of Unified
celebrity events later this week.After a long period
of dry summer weather, Berlin was this week been exposed to
intermittent showers, which is causing a few headaches for
the outdoor events, like the 3x3 Unified basketball
competition.This Unified event, where Special
Olympics athletes compete alongside players without a
disability, is located at the beautiful Neptunbrunnen Park,
but may need to be moved indoors if the artificial courts
become a slippery hazard.Rain also threatened the
Opening Ceremony last night, but the weather gods smiled on
the World Summer Games that produces more smiles than any
other sport event on the
planet.
