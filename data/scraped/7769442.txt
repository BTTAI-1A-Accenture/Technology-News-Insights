Summary:Â 

Today I welcome Kara Collier, the co-founder and VP of Health at Nutrisense, one of Americaâs fastest-growing wellness-tech startups. After becoming frustrated with the shortcomings of the traditional healthcare system, she made it her mission to help others reach their maximum health potential using modern technology & expert coaching. She is the leading authority on the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology for health optimization and disease prevention.Â 

In this episode, we jam about a topic not often discussed by traditional healthcare systems until itâs too late - the role of glucose and insulin response in your body and how it affects your metabolic health. Glucose monitoring is not just for people with diabetes! We talk about insulin sensitivity in our modern (often stress-filled!) lifestyles, the many factors that affect our insulin responses, and how we can monitor our insulin fluctuations to better understand how we metabolize different foods. Glucose monitoring can help us to make more informed lifestyle choices to optimize our overall well-being and long-term health.
