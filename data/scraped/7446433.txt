In a wild turn of events overnight, superstar shortstop Carlos Correa and the Mets reached a 12-year, $315 million deal after Correa's previous -- but not yet fully completed -- deal with the San Francisco Giants fell through. Correa, an All-Star shortstop who played with the Minnesota Twins last season, is expected to move to third base as the Mets already have Francisco Lindor at shortstop. Now, the other side of the story: how did the Giants mess this up?!  The canceling of the press conference clearly struck a nerve with Correa, because just hours later, in the middle of the night, Mets team owner Steve Cohen and the shortstop's agent Scott Boras ironed out the blockbuster contract while the billionaire was reportedly in Hawaii. For the Mets, this is enormous as they now have two of the best shortstops in baseball on their own roster. The monster deal pushes the Mets' payroll to an estimated $384 million, along with $111 million in luxury tax payments. And for the Giants, well, this is quite an unprecedented offseason they're having. First, there was the erroneous report that Judge was picking them over the Yankees (spoiler alert: he didn't) and now they've lost Correa. ...

This time two weeks ago, the Cowboys had won three straight, including a 40-3 blowout of the Vikings and a 54-19 blowout of the Colts. Since then, Dallas barely avoided an embarrassing loss to the Texans and followed that up by blowing a 17-point lead against the Jaguars. That has Dallas down from third to seventh in Pete Prisco's latest Power Rankings. Here's the top 10: .@Eagles are still the top dawgs in the NFL pic.twitter.com/kP5ckfNRZM Speaking of the Jaguars, they made the biggest jump of any team this week, going from 24th to 17th. No team is tougher to figure out than the Vikings, who showed their best and their worst all in one game by pulling off the largest comeback in NFL history Saturday. They're now 11-3 this season but have only outscored their opponents 351-349. The offense can be terrific. The defense is often awful. Pete's not quite sure what to think of them. For more, here's Pete's entire rankings. 🏒 Devils at Panthers, 7 p.m. on TNT🏀 Warriors at Nets, 7:30 p.m. on NBA TV🏒 Oilers at Stars, 9:30 p.m. on TNT🏀 Hornets at Clippers, 10:30 p.m. on NBA TV © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.
