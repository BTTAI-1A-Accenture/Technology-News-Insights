    Skip the grocery store and get these meal delivery services straight to your door.
   Our experts have logged more than five years of cooking more than 75 meal kits and tasting more than 100 prepared meals from various services to help land on our list of the best in 2024.  
      What to consider
      
      Meal kit versus prepared meal delivery
     Meal kits will demand more of your time and energy but they'll also cost a little less per serving. Prepared meals require almost no time and energy, other than what it takes to actually eat the food, but typically run a few bucks more per serving. 
      Cost
     There are meal kits with recipes for as cheap as $5 a serving with basic menus and no-frills recipes. More expensive services include recipes with more exotic ingredients, high-end cuts of meat and organic produce but can cost as much as $15 or $20 a serving. 
      Healthiness
     While most meal delivery services have healthy options, some are much healthier than others. If you're keen on eating low-calorie, low-carb, plant-based or pescatarian food, certain meal kits and meal delivery services will be better than others. 
      Number of meals per week
     If you can't imagine yourself cooking more than twice per week, don't order more than two meal kits because they typically won't last more than a week in the fridge. Most prepared meals either arrive frozen or can be frozen after unboxing. That means it's less of an issue if you order too many meals on your first go around.

From prepared meals to meal delivery kits, I found the best meal kit delivery service you can buy.

   Blue Apron's steaks and seafood are the best I've had from a standard meal kit plan. Why I picked Blue Apron: With tasty, premium entrees such as steak and seafood at some of the best prices in the meal kit category, Blue Apron represents the best overall value for any meal delivery service I tried. I also loved the oven-ready family-style meals which take about 5 minutes to prepare and make four or five servings.  Blue Apron is the granddad of meal kit programs in the US and the brand still manages to deliver excellent meals with easy-to-follow recipes all at a fair price. It's also the most eco-friendly meal kit, according to this study.  Weekly menu choices available range from simple pasta dishes to inventive global cuisine, with high-end recipes including those for steak and seafood at no extra cost. The value of this service is clear. I compared the cost of Blue Apron meal kits to the cost of buying the same groceries at a market and two out of three were cheaper when made with Blue Apron. Blue Apron's steaks and seafood are the best I've had from a standard meal kit plan.

   Why I picked CookUnity: This is a prepared meal service aimed at those with refined tastes and an adventurous palate. The best thing about CookUnity is the sheer volume of meal options you can choose from, all originating from chefs -- some famous and some less so -- of different backgrounds and culinary styles.  I liked almost everything I tried, with recipes ranging from very healthy to more comfort-style food. There are plenty of options for vegetarians too, but note that the menu will vary depending on where you live since they pull from local chefs to create the weekly offerings.

   The spicy beef soup (aka chili) was super fast, simple and satisfying.  Why I picked HelloFresh: HelloFresh combines, convenience, selection and family-friendly options for an all-around excellent meal kit experience.  HelloFresh has the most recipes per week of any meal kit service I tried making it a good pick for families and homes with picky eaters. This meal kit service's portion sizes are generous and there are meals to fit eating plans and diets of all sorts. It's also affordable, especially if you order larger meals. You know, for a family. HelloFresh recipes are mostly fast and easy to follow, even for beginner cooks. Plus, they'll allow you to make substitutions so you can always find a recipe that suits your taste. The spicy beef soup (aka chili) was super fast, simple and satisfying.

   Many of EveryPlate recipes are simple and fuss-free. I like that.  Why I picked EveryPlate: At just $6 per serving -- even cheaper with a sign-up offer -- and an emphasis on delicious, hearty meal options and generous portion sizes, EveryPlate is the best cheap meal kit service I've tried.  EveryPlate keeps overhead costs low (often cheaper than if you bought the groceries yourself) by offering just eight easy meal kit recipes to choose from weekly, which mostly excludes vegetarians and those on special diets, but the eight available meals are full of variety and flavor otherwise. You can expect a lot of comfort food from this meal kit service such as meatloaf, burgers and pasta dishes but everything I made was solid. Best of all, you can score meals for as low as $1.49, with free shipping on your first order. Many of EveryPlate recipes are simple and fuss-free. I like that.

   Factor has plenty of keto options including this bunless burger.  Why I picked Factor: With plans that cost as little as $11 a meal and options for a variety of diets and eating plans, Factor is a solid option for those looking to eliminate cooking from the to-do list. Factor is a healthy prepared meal service and had some of the best meals I tried in all my testing of prepared meal services, including a zesty pesto salmon and a divine keto cheesecake. Among the hits were the occasional misses, so you may have to learn the menu over time. Factor puts a focus on healthy meals with plenty of low-carb options, and all the nutritional information is listed on the website before you choose your meals each week. With all the keto and paleo meal options, it's certainly a solid choice for people keeping to either of those plans. Factor has plenty of keto options including this bunless burger.

   Some plastic is necessary for meal kits to work, but Home Chef uses more than the average service.  Why I picked Home Chef: Home Chef is a meal kit service with a sprawling menu that includes tons of low-carb options. Even if you're not going full keto, but just want to curb your carb intake, Home Chef offers 15 recipes a week with less than 15 grams of net carbs in each.  On balance, Home Chef meal kits weren't the best I tried, but the bulk of meals I made took less than 25 minutes and the portions were more than satisfying. That coupled with its slew of easy, healthy low-carb options makes Home Chef the best meal kit service for keto eaters. Some plastic is necessary for meal kits to work, but Home Chef uses more than the average service.

   Why I picked Mosaic Foods: This plant-based service was one of the best-prepared meal services I tried, and not just among vegan options. Every recipe was at least good, often better, and family meals start at just $6 a serving when you choose a family plan. I sampled more than 10 of Mosaic Food's plant-based prepared meal offerings and the vegetarian prepared meal delivery service had an astoundingly high hit rate. Mosaic uses global flavors and employs creative use of meat substitutes such as tofu, jackfruit, cauliflower and vegan sausages to create tasty and satisfying vegetarian meals. While everything I ate from Mosaic was at least good, some standouts included the bean and jackfruit chili, tomato olive and feta ragout and a tangy Thai noodle dish.

   I put Green Chef's meal kits to the test once again.  Why I picked Green Chef: This meal kit service uses almost all organic meats and produce, and offers interesting and healthy recipes for the discerning home cook. The recipes I tried were healthy, tasty and easy to make. While it may be one of the pricier options, I like Green Chef for its versatility in the different specific diet plans available. The healthy meal kit service also boasts the most organic ingredients of any meal kit service including produce, meats and fish. Green Chef also offers paleo, keto, pescatarian, vegan and vegetarian meals as well as gluten-free meal kit recipes and meals. I put Green Chef's meal kits to the test once again.

   Pete's Real Food (formerly Pete's Paleo) is an excellent meal service if you're adhering to a paleo or whole foods eating plan. Why I picked Pete's Real Food: While it's more expensive than other prepared meal services on our list, the quality of food doesn't get much higher than Pete's. The cuisine is designed to fuel those following the precise paleo diet, but even those not keeping to the plan should enjoy this grub. Pete's Real Food (formerly Pete's Paleo) won me over in a weeklong taste test of its healthy organic and paleo meals, earning a spot as one of the best healthy, organic meal delivery services. Pete's meals are all fully prepared and ready to heat and eat. The dozen or so Pete's Real Food meals I've tested were all cooked well: meats were tender, vegetables (mostly) cooked to proper doneness and all the flavors worked.  If you're in training or keeping to a paleo plan and looking for lots of protein, healthy fats and nutrient-filled carbs such as sweet potatoes and beets, Pete's should hit the spot.  The biggest drawback is Pete's expensive shipping which typically costs around $40. This means it's really only worth it to order meals in bulk. Pete's Real Food (formerly Pete's Paleo) is an excellent meal service if you're adhering to a paleo or whole foods eating plan.

   Purple Carrot recipes are slightly more involved than your average meal kit. Why our testers picked Purple Carrot: For authentic, organic, plant-based cooking, Purple Carrot delivered big with a bounty of interesting recipes and fresh ingredients.  Out of all the vegan meal kits I've tried, Purple Carrot's provided me with the best base for cooking vegan cuisine and its ingredient mainstays such as lentils and grains. There are about eight recipes to choose from each week. I tested a full week's worth of meals and enjoyed all of them. Purple Carrot recipes are slightly more involved than your average meal kit.  Meal kits or prepared meals? It's the first decision you'll have to make. Some services offer both, however.  The first big decision you'll make is whether you want meal kits, which require some prep and cooking, or a prepared meal service that sends fully cooked meals that are ready to heat and eat. Meal kits will demand more of your time and energy but they'll also cost a little less per serving. Prepared meals require almost no time and energy, other than what it takes to actually eat the food, but typically run a few bucks more per serving. If you opt for a cheaper meal kit service, you might not get as many steak and seafood options.  After you've picked between meal kits or meal delivery, you'll want to find a service within your budget. There are meal kits with recipes for as cheap as $5 a serving with basic menus and no-frills recipes. More expensive services include recipes with more exotic ingredients, high-end cuts of meat and organic produce but can cost as much as $15 or $20 a serving. Here I've outlined all the best cheap meal delivery services for 2024.  Daily Harvest is one of the healthiest meal delivery services we tried. While most meal delivery services have healthy options, some are much healthier than others. If you're keen on eating low-calorie, low-carb, plant-based or pescatarian food, certain meal kits and meal delivery services will be better than others. Our list of the healthiest meal delivery services for 2024 is a good place to find all the most nutritious options.  With most services, the more meals you choose per week, the cheaper the price per meal. Lastly, you'll want to home in on exactly how much food you'll want sent to you per week. If you can't imagine yourself cooking more than twice per week, don't order more than two meal kits because they typically won't last more than a week in the fridge.  Most prepared meals either arrive frozen or can be frozen after unboxing. That means it's less of an issue if you order too many meals on your first go around. Most services allow you to change the number of meals or servings in your plan even after you've started. With nearly every service, the more meals your order per delivery, the cheaper it is per meal.  Meal kits are judged on several factors as we cook our way through a box of recipes. All the meal delivery services may look delicious in their website glamour shots, but that's certainly not enough to convince me. To settle on this list of the best meal delivery services I tried as many as we could get our hands on, noting everything about them from freshness and flavor to ordering, packaging and delivery. Testing meal kits for CNET means rolling up our sleeves and cooking at least one week's worth of meals from each service, often more. How each meal kit tastes, how easy it was to prepare and the portion sizes are all considered. I also evaluate the website and how easy it is to navigate along with determining how easy it is to pause, cancel or change your order at any given time. To learn more, I have an in-depth look at how we test meal kits here at CNET. Some meal delivery services require cooking from scratch, while others offer dishes that just need to be heated up.  To test each meal delivery service, I tried at least five and sometimes as many as 10 meals from any given service. I chose a range of meals from the various menu and meal plan offerings and took note of the ordering process, recipe variety and information available. I reheated meals according to the instructions. If there were none, I heated them the way I would if left to my own devices. Often that meant warming gently in a nonstick skillet or reheating in my air fryer. Many of the meal delivery services offer a microwave heating option, but I almost always found that produced worse results than my trusted methods, even if they typically take a few seconds longer. Dinnerly meal kits are fast, easy and won't cost you an arm and a leg. Meal kits are best for those seeking truly fresh food. Prepared meals are great for those uninterested in cooking.   If you're looking to cut some of the legwork out of dinner, meal kits and prepared meal services are definitely worth it. The most budget-friendly services cost about the same as buying all the groceries you'd need to make the same meal, with the convenience of having all the ingredients or a box of fully prepared meals sent to your home each week. If you score one of the cheaper, budget-friendly meal kits you can get meals as low as $5-$8 per serving. That's cheaper than eating out or getting restaurant food delivered and is about the same cost as buying the groceries needed to make the same meals. Most meal delivery services run in the $10 to $12 per serving range, while the more premium services, including Green Chef, Sunbasket and Pete's Real Food, cost more like $12 to $16 per serving.  In a previous story, we crunched the numbers to find out how much meal kits cost versus buying the same groceries. EveryPlate and Dinnerly are the cheapest meal kits, with plans that start at $6 or $7 per serving. Blue Apron and HelloFresh are also affordable, with plans as cheap as $8 a serving.  The cheapest prepared meal delivery service is Mosaic Foods since it has family meals that cost just $6 per serving.  In reviews and best lists, Blue Apron and HelloFresh are two of the most popular meal kit services for 2024. Fresh N Lean and Factor are some of the most popular options for prepared meal subscriptions.
