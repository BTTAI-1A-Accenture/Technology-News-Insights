Thought Technology is pleased to host two upcoming workshops, organized by US-based Successful Practitioner in conjunction with InMindOut, for healthcare professionals interested in enhancing their practice, by adding a psychophysiological assessment and training component. MONTREAL (PRWEB) May 25, 2023   Thought Technology, an international leader in the field of psychophysiological monitoring equipment, is offering two upcoming workshops at their Montreal headquarters, designed to provide clinicians with the fundamentals of Biofeedback and neurofeedback in order to add or enhance their knowledge of these techniques for their practice. More and more, people are looking to technology to stay on top of their personal health metrics, sometimes without a deep understanding of what the data means. Clinicians trained in biofeedback typically use clinical grade equipment to perform a psychophysiological assessment and can bring forth a much deeper level of knowledge about what metrics are important, how to use the information learned from assessing specific metrics, and how to help their clients lead healthier lives or perform at a higher level. This course focuses on the typical parameters used in biofeedback, such as heart rate, temperature, skin conductance, blood volume and muscle activity, along with how to use this information in practice. The neurofeedback course will focus on EEG and the areas of the brain that are associated with different disorders such as ADHD, anxiety and depression, among others, and how neurofeedback can be used to ameliorate these conditions and optimize  brain activity. Both courses will be instructed by Dr. Manuel Halter and registration is now open. Biofeedback Certificate Course
