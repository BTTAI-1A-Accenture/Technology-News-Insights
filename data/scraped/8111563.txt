Popular image editor Picsart has just launched an AI-powered GIF generator. It lets you create cool animated GIFs using text prompts. Unlike other text-to-image generators that generate static images, this new AI tool generates animated GIFs. For using this GIF generator, you need to download the Picsart app or update it to the latest version. Open the app and tap the + icon at the bottom of the screen. Start with a blank canvas and go to ‘more tools’ at the bottom of the screen. Find the ‘AI GIF Generator’ and then enter your prompt. Select ‘generate’ to generate GIFs. You can try using different text prompts and see what kind of GIF it generates. The company has integrated the FIG tool into its Android, iOS, and web apps. So, you can use it on any platform of your choice and generate funny animated GIFs. The tool generates most GIFs cartoony. So, don’t expect real-looking GIFs. But, this is a fun game to try. Picsart’s AI GIF generator is now available. So, try it and see how it works for you. You must be logged in to post a comment.
