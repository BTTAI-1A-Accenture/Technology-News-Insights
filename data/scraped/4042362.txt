— Liz W. A: To replace a lost Rhode Island title, the “Application for Title (TR-2/TR-9)” form is required and the fee is $52.50. This form can be found on our website, dmv.ri.gov, in the “Forms” tab and “Title Forms.” You can mail this form and payment to RI DMV, Attention: Research Office, 600 New London Ave., Cranston, RI 02920. You can also make a reservation to come into the Cranston DMV and drop off the paperwork and payment at that office, which is located on the third floor. Our Drop Box is also available for this transaction in case you don’t want to make a reservation. With duplicate title requests, one of the most important things to remember is that, if you ever had a loan on the vehicle and the lien holder was not removed from the title after paying off the loan, an original Lien Release Letter will be needed from the lien holder. You would submit this letter with the duplication title application and payment. Chuck Hollis is assistant administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles.
