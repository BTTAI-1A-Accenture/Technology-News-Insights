Wisconsin basketball got the party started on Sunday at the Kohl Center with their annual Red and White Scrimmage. Wisconsin matches up with each other in an open practice and scrimmage for fans to get their first look at the new Badger squad. While there are many returners expected to play big roles, one of the most exciting new faces is AJ Storr, the transfer from St. John’s. Storr is a three-level scorer who can sky, and should give Badger fans plenty of highlights. Here is a look at his first highlight at the Kohl Center, coming on a lob from Kamari McGee: Got something in Storr this season@KamariMcGee ↗️ @storr_aj pic.twitter.com/mwVapGyvAQ — Wisconsin Basketball (@BadgerMBB) October 15, 2023  Sign up for our newsletter to get updates to your inbox, and also receive offers from us, our affiliates and partners.
