Lloyds Bank offers 2 per cent interest up to £5,000, and TSB an interest rate of 5 per cent, but this is only on £500. 'If you are a student looking to travel abroad then Nationwide would be worth considering, as they are the only student account to offer no fees for using your debit card abroad. 'Students should act quickly to take advantage of the cashback incentives offered as they are only available for a limited time, but choose wisely.' Some links in this article may be affiliate links.
