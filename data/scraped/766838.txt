The field of computing has grown by leap and bounds over the years, and the demand for high-end computers that can process large amounts of data has become increasingly prevalent in the modern world. In this article, we will be looking at some of the most powerful computers in the world. 1. Summit Supercomputer: Located in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Summit is currently the most powerful computer in the world. With a processing speed of 200 petaflops, it can perform over 200,000 trillion calculations per second. Summit’s primary use is in scientific research, particularly in cancer research and the development of new materials. 2. Sunway TaihuLight Supercomputer: A product of China, the TaihuLight Supercomputer is the second most powerful computer in the world with a processing speed of 93 petaflops. The computer took three years to build and mainly supports research activities, particularly in the weather forecasting and climate modeling sectors. 3. Sierra Supercomputer: Standing as the third most powerful computer in the world is the Sierra Supercomputer, located at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, USA. With a processing speed of 71.6 petaflops, it serves the purpose of simulation making and stockpile safety. 4. Frontera Supercomputer: A product of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), the Frontera Supercomputer is the most powerful computer in the USA and a contender in the global computing race. With a processing speed of 23.5 petaflops, it performs tasks from science and engineering simulations to big data analysis. 5. Piz Daint Supercomputer: The Piz Daint Supercomputer is situated at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and has a processing speed of 21.2 petaflops. It is mostly used for research activities, particularly in the fields of climate research and molecular dynamics.

 Since technology is not going anywhere and does more good than harm, adapting is the best course of action. That is where The Tech Edvocate comes in. We plan to cover the PreK-12 and Higher Education EdTech sectors and provide our readers with the latest news and opinion on the subject. From time to time, I will invite other voices to weigh in on important issues in EdTech. We hope to provide a well-rounded, multi-faceted look at the past, present, the future of EdTech in the US and internationally. We started this journey back in June 2016, and we plan to continue it for many more years to come. I hope that you will join us in this discussion of the past, present and future of EdTech and lend your own insight to the issues that are discussed.
