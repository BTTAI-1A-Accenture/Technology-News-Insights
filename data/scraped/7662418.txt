     SHARE A Prince William County woman won more than $228,000 playing the Virginia Lottery online. Gloria Stallworth won more than $228,000 playing the Virginia Lottery online.  Gloria Stallworth was sitting at her computer at home playing the Virginia Lottery’s The Lamp online game.  “I started winning and winning,” she later told Virginia Lottery officials. And then something happened that she never expected. “I just checked it and…boom!” she said. “This big number came up!” The Woodbridge woman had just won a $228,218 jackpot. “We were just trying to figure out if it’s real or not,” she said. It was real! The Lamp features a progressive, growing jackpot and can be accessed at the Lottery’s website, valottery.com, or on the Lottery’s mobile app. The odds per game of winning a prize are 1 in 3.55. In addition to online instant games, players can purchase Powerball, Mega Millions, Cash4Life, Pick 3, Pick 4, Pick 5 and Cash 5 with EZ Match plays online. Players must be at least 18 years of age and physically located in Virginia.  Stallworth, who runs a medical supply company, said she hopes to use her winnings for home repairs.
