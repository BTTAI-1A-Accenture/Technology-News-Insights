Our focus on unit economics, together with the restructuring changes, is starting to bear fruit as evident in the significant improvement in Retail GPU to £980 in Q1 2023. Whilst the broader economic environment remains challenging, demand was robust in the quarter and we sold 13,314 retail cars as our online proposition continues to resonate with consumers due to the selection, transparency and convenience of using our platform. “We remain laser-focused on improving our unit economics, optimizing our fixed cost base and maximizing our cash runway. In Q1 2023, we delivered positive progress to further increase our Retail GPU with continued quarterly sequential growth in Retail GPU of 64% (up 690% YoY) and are very encouraged to have already achieved over £1,200 in March, which we set as our target for the full year. “We are applying a more targeted approach to which vehicles we buy, guided by our proprietary data of their desirability, with a better selection of models available on our website driving better margins. During the quarter, a record 52.5% of buyers (up from 47.4% in Q1 2022) arranged financing directly through our platform entirely online, as we saw more applications together with better customer quality and higher acceptance rates. Reconditioning costs have continued to improve following the consolidation of our vehicle preparation centres and the relentless drive for greater efficiency from the team. We expect to see further progress across both these areas as well as across logistics spend and marketing effectiveness. “Our cash position remains strong with £215 million1 of cash and cash equivalents and approximately £60 million of self-financed inventory. During the quarter, we took the difficult decision to reduce our headcount materially in order to optimize our fixed costs which resulted in c.£13 million of one-off costs. We expect to see a reduction in SG&A2 run rates of over £25 million per quarter by Q4 2023, representing over £100 million of annualised savings going into 2024. As we guided previously, the cash utilization rate is expected to reduce to approximately £30 million per quarter by the end of the year, and we anticipate finishing the year with between £110 million and £130 million of cash and between £15 million and £25 million of self-financed inventory. We reiterate our guidance for 2023 and remain fully focused on delivering profitable growth.” Summary Results   Three months ended March 31,     2023 (unaudited) 20221 (unaudited) Change Vehicles Sold 17,447 18,679 -7% Retail 13,314 12,844 4% Wholesale 4,133 5,835 -29% Revenue (£m)2 247 279 -11% Retail (£m)2 222 234 -5% Wholesale (£m) 21 36 -42% Other (£m) 4 9 -56% Retail GPU (£)3 980 124 690% Gross Profit (£m) 14 3 367% Gross Margin (%) 5.8% 1.1% +4.7 ppts Cash and cash equivalents (£m)4 215 525 -58% 1 The Q1 2022 comparatives have been restated to exclude the EU segment which is treated as a discontinued operation. 2 “Retail revenue” excludes £nil of sales in Q1 2023 where Cazoo sold vehicles as an agent for third parties and only the net commission received from those sales is recorded within revenue (Q1 2022: £1 million). Retail revenue also comprises ancillary products, including financing and warranty. These amounts were previously included in “Other sales”. “Other sales” comprises revenue from walk-in servicing, subscription services, third-party reconditioning and the provision of data services. The comparatives for Q1 2022 have been restated for consistency. 3 Retail GPU (Gross Profit per Unit) is derived from UK retail and ancillary product revenues, divided by UK retail units sold (net of returns). 4 The balance excludes £6.4 million of cash related to assets held for sale in relation to the announced sale of Cluno, as Cazoo has been paid for Cluno but the transaction has not yet completed with its balance sheet still being consolidated.
