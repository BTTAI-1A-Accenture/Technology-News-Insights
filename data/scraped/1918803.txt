RAJOURI, Feb 1: The people of Begunara of Sub Division Thana Mandi blocked the road and protested against the Dharam Raj Construction Company
The road construction company, which is constructing the Rajouri- Surankot road via Thannamandi, has uprooted the water pipes at Manyal due to which the water supply in the area has been affected for the past one month, but they have not restored the water supply. Due to this the people had to resort to protest.
The protesting men and women raised slogans against the company management. They said that due to non-availability of water they were facing severe difficulties. They further said that they have to travel miles to get water from the spring. The protesters alleged that the area is being neglected while uninterrupted water supply is being ensured in the neighboring villages. They said if water supply is not ensured to the area, they will be forced to intensify the protest. People told that they have repeatedly called XEn Jal Shakti Rajouri but he didnâ€™t pay any attention towards the issue.
