  A kind-hearted woman has raised £1,300 for the Ayrshire Hospice after taking on a tough swimming challenge. 
 
  Jean Lanham decided to raise funds for the charity after the excellent care her dad and family recently received from staff. 
 
  Originally Jean had decided to sign up for the Go Swim Loch Tay event to swim 1,500 metres but could not compete due to an unjury. 
 
  However, this didn't stop her and with a clean bill of health, she swam 1,700 metres at Croyde Bay in North Devon on a recent family holiday. 
 
  The hospice has thanked Jean for her efforts, as she handed over the cheque to charity staff.
