 How I Built This by Guy Raz . One of my favourite podcast series. Guy chats candidly with founders of household name brands, deep diving into the origins of the company, no stone left uncovered. Thereâ€™s always so many moments to unpack. Iâ€™m always fascinated by the trigger; the moment the idea was sparked. They say great businesses solve big challenges, so itâ€™s here that we learn what the problem was and how the entrepreneur envisioned the product solving it. Another significant moment is that first big breakthrough, the moment they realised theyâ€™re on to something. With each big win, thereâ€™s always a moment of turmoil. Perhaps a big competitor, a lawsuit, or founding team separating. Itâ€™s these moments that ultimately steer the direction of the business, and in the cases HIBT, in the direction of success. It really is an eye-opening listen. The constant theme in these eventual success stories is when and how they went away from the norm. Some companies do from the outset, and some do when they become stagnant.  The latest one I listened to was with Payal Kadakia, the founder of ClassPass. The global activity booking app, although like all 21st century companies they probably label themselves as a tech company.  Nonetheless, a fascinating story of childhood embarrassment, a deep affinity for Indian Dance, a shocking product release and importantly, lots of Unthinking. Payalâ€™s first trace of Unthinking was her application letter to study Operations Research at MIT in 2005. She shared her connection to the number 2 including being her motherâ€™s second daughter and her dual identity (American and Indian). It worked. Â  After MIT, she went to the large consultancy Bain & Co, although we wonâ€™t hold that against her. ðŸ˜‰ The trigger for ClassPass was when Payal was born out of frustration from spending too much time flicking through different fitness class websites in 2011 when she had just moved to New York and couldnâ€™t find a local Indian Dance class to join. In June 2012 and having spent $500k, ClassPass 1.0 (then called Classivity) was released. In the first 10 days they received a grand total of 0 bookings. Ah, the first moment of failure. Providing classes for free still didnâ€™t encourage bookings. Payal realised that this was a human behaviour problem. All the technology was there, people were visiting the website, the â€˜buyâ€™ button worked, but convincing people to book and pay for classes was the challenge. They had to unthink: They switched up the way they displayed information, they took inspiration from OpenTable and Skyscanner. They needed people to be in the same mindset to when they are booking a plane ticket or restaurant; â€˜Iâ€™ve made the decision to go on holiday/eat out, I just need to decide whereâ€™, instead of â€˜shall I go to a fitness classâ€™. Gamify and make it social. They created a Passport where you got stamped for each class attended in a 30-day trial for a reduced price. It encouraged people to go in pairs and groups. Ask for forgiveness, not for permission. ClassPass offered $100 Lululemon gift cards for those who remained subscribers after 6 months. When Lululemon found out, they offered a cease and desist order. Instead of intimidated, Payal was secretly chuffed that a huge retailer knew who ClassPass were, and admitted she may have offered one or two more after. To this day, ClassPass have raised $550m, have a global footprint, been fluid with their proposition and continued to fend off stiff competition. They were the first company to become a Unicorn in this decade after their latest Series E funding round. Give How I Built This a try. Thereâ€™s plenty to choose from and listen out for those moments in the journey that shape them to where they are today. Â Â
