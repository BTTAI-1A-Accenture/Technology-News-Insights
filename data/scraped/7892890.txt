In the time since we have had modern technology, one of the main advantages that we have utilised is engaging with users and of course, creating influence. With the development of various online platforms, including social media and discussion forums, it is a simple task nowadays to attract investors toward a space. For crypto, online presence is a lifeline as it is vital to forming communities, driving value, and attracting investors.  Cosmos and Chainlink both have a strong online presence because of how they strategize their awareness. Both have an archive of published articles, along with a strong social media presence that promotes their products and services, the cosmos having a presence on a discussion forum as well. Similarly, since DogeMiyagi is fairly new to the market and is only in its presale, it is doing enough for now with its strong social media presence.  Chainlink is one of the most adopted crypto projects on the market and enables smart contracts to receive real-world information from external sources, along with providing a proven secure network that allows this information to be tamper-proof. This forms part of its success, the rest is in the massive online footprint that it has created.  It has a strong social media presence on platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter, sharing news about achievements, milestones, and new developments. In addition to this, it has a plethora of publications both on its website and also externally which announce new releases, partnerships, and other new developments.  Altogether, maintaining this strong presence, allows existing investors and other interested parties to constantly be up to date with the latest insights about the projects. With the general reporting being on the positive side, their audience will be compelled to invest in the tokens, thereby also increasing the value and helping its performance.   Affectionately referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains”, Cosmos focuses on creating a network that is united through interoperability and is optimized for streamlining transactions. With a variety of different aspects within its ecosystem, Cosmos fosters an environment for developers to work efficiently and securely.  Cosmos has a variety of online spaces where users can interact with each other, share news and discuss the coin. One of these is Discord and Cosmos has a link on their website which takes the users directly to a discord server where they can hold these conversations. Furthermore, it has a wide variety of publications available both on its website and externally that users can access to be aware of the latest developments and also educate themselves about the complexities of the Cosmos Hub.  Moreover, the platform has a great social media presence and actively engages with its community through Twitter. Here, it shares key milestones and news about new features, partnerships, and events. Through all of this, investors can see that Cosmos is an actively developing project that holds a lot of investment potential and through this, it will entice them to flock to the platform and become token holders, thereby driving up the value of the coin.  DogeMiyagi is a fairly new meme coin on the market that is crafted after one of the most famous pieces of pop culture – Karate Kid. This concept creates an emotional and sentimental connection with its audience, which then leads them to invest in crypto.  It is given that DogeMiyagi will have a weak social media presence. However, the platform does utilise social media like Twitter and Telegram to build its community. Like Chainlink and Cosmos, this allows the users to hold discussions and share insights about the coin, which helps to influence the decisions of the investors.  Furthermore, it uses Twitter to share updates about milestones, special bonus offers and to engage with a wider community. This is crucial in its referral system because it allows interested investors to see the incentive for bringing more people to the platform, which helps them to grow and build a larger community.  For crypto, building a strong online presence is essential to its survival. This allows the platforms to actively engage with their communities and also attract more interested investors. The strategies that are implemented by Cosmos and Chainlink have been crucial to their success and DogeMiyagi could follow this same method to ensure its success.  For More On DogeMiyagi: Website: https://dogemiyagi.com  Twitter: https://twitter.com/_Dogemiyagi_  Telegram: https://t.me/dogemiyagi  If you’re here, you understand the importance of safeguarding your valuable assets and enhancing...
