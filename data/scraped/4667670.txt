If that happens and the annual inflation shows a decrease, we would be able to say that the US' interest rate hikes seem to be working on shrinking the possibility of economic recession. This will bring fresh liquidity in the markets and we could see the total crypto market capitalisation to grow in the coming weeks.” Meanwhile, a small number of altcoins did meet with losses on Wednesday.
