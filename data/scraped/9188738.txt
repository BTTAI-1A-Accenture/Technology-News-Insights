The 2022-23 NBA season is winding down, as there is just one month left in the regular season.  One of the most exciting things for basketball fans to watch is the exciting dunks that happen on a nightly basis.  The NBA's All-Star Weekend features a highly anticipated dunk contest every season, and last month Mac McClung won the competition.  On Friday, StatMuse revealed who leads the NBA in dunks this season.
