 Everyone I know has a personal stake in the battle against cancer, me included. I lost my mother and a grandmother to it, I‚Äôve watched my sister and another grandmother battle it, and I‚Äôve dealt with it personally myself. Thanks to early detection, my #coloncancer was caught and treated when it was most curable, but I know so many people whose personal experience wasn‚Äôt as positive.  Battling #cancer is also a professional passion of mine. Through my career, I have had the privilege of helping shepherd leading pioneers in cancer detection and treatment to market ‚Äì learning more and more about the disease and the silos we have in innovation, research, and patient care. Breaking those silos will require collaboration, so that‚Äôs why I enthusiastically accepted an invitation from my friend and former client @AliceLinPomponio to serve as an adviser for the @AmericanCancerSociety‚Äôs new investing and venture capital arm, @BrightEdge. At @RealChemistry, we believe health citizenship is critical to transform what healthcare is to what it should be ‚Äì an experience that shouldn‚Äôt be dictated by the color of our skin or how many zeros are in our bank accounts. That health citizenship mantle is especially important in battling cancer, which respects no age, gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status or a healthy lifestyle.  Through my experience and relationships I have throughout the life sciences sector, I hope to help BrightEdge spark a collaborative breakthrough that can help innovative companies in the battle against cancer. In this new role, I am embracing my role as a health citizen, using my experience and relationships to help move knowledge into action. I am especially enthusiastic about BrightEdge‚Äôs mission to not only broaden access to innovative cancer therapies but also to make cancer care less financially toxic and improve the bench-to-bedside experience for every cancer patient in the world. My involvement with the American Cancer Society goes back to when I was a little kid collecting donations for my mom, and now at this career stage I can leverage my knowledge, networks, and influence in new ways to conquer cancer by working side-by-side with BrightEdge leaders to invest in companies focused on ancillary early detection, treatment facilitation and #healthequity. Through affiliations with leading research engines like MIT and advisers that span multiple disciplines within healthcare, I am confident that together we can crush those silos that prevent effective healthcare delivery, especially in cancer. It all begins with helping create meaningful connections over a shared purpose, stimulating collaboration and getting the right people involved in the fight. Speaking of meaningful connections, I am excited to meet with Alice, Real Chemistry clients and friends in-person next week at the 41st annual @JP Morgan Healthcare Conference where we can start bringing together the brightest in the industry to have meaningful conversations about how we can work together to create better healthcare experiences.

Congratulations Corporate communications leader and brand storyteller | connector, builder and leader of high-performing teams | internal, external and executive communications  | strategy, culture and change management | üè≥Ô∏èüåà Incredible news! Congratulations, Jim. As a fellow cancer survivor this is meaningful knowing the impact you‚Äôre going to have! Founder, CEO Rothenberg Strategic Communications, Inc. My career started at the ACS (many years ago!) and, from there, led me to Burson-Marsteller, Organon and, ultimately, Johnson & Johnson, where I spent the majority of my career. I am pleased to learn of this appointment, bringing together your thought-leadership, collaboration and business-building skills to what, to me, remains one of the best not-for-profit health organizations anywhere. Kudos Jim.
