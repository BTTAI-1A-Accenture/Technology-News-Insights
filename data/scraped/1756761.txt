Large group facilitation can be challenging, especially when you want to keep your audience engaged, attentive, and inspired. One way to enhance your facilitation skills is to use videos and animations to create visual interest and convey your message more effectively. In this article, you will learn how to use videos and animations in large group facilitation, what benefits they can bring, and what pitfalls to avoid.
 
The first step to using videos and animations in large group facilitation is to select the ones that are relevant and appropriate for your topic, purpose, and audience. You want to use videos and animations that support your main points, illustrate your examples, or evoke emotions. You also want to make sure that they are suitable for the context, culture, and expectations of your audience. Avoid using videos and animations that are too long, too complex, too distracting, or too controversial.
 
The second step to using videos and animations in large group facilitation is to integrate them with your facilitation style and techniques. You want to use videos and animations as a complement, not a substitute, for your verbal and non-verbal communication. You also want to use them as a tool to facilitate interaction, discussion, or reflection among your audience. For example, you can use videos and animations to introduce a topic, to break the ice, to spark a debate, or to summarize a key message.
 
The third step to using videos and animations in large group facilitation is to prepare and test them beforehand. You want to make sure that the videos and animations are of high quality, that they work well with the equipment and the platform you are using, and that they are accessible and compatible with different devices and browsers. You also want to have a backup plan in case of technical issues or internet connection problems. For example, you can have a transcript, a summary, or an alternative activity ready.
 
The fourth step to using videos and animations in large group facilitation is to use them wisely and sparingly. You want to use videos and animations as a way to enhance your facilitation, not to overwhelm or bore your audience. You also want to use them as a way to create variety and balance in your facilitation, not to create inconsistency or confusion. For example, you can use videos and animations to highlight important points, to add some humor or emotion, or to change the pace or mood.
 
The fifth step to using videos and animations in large group facilitation is to provide context and guidance for them. You want to explain to your audience why you are using a video or an animation, what you want them to pay attention to, and what you want them to do after watching it. You also want to ask for feedback, questions, or comments from your audience, and to link the video or animation to the next topic or activity. For example, you can use a question, a statement, or a prompt to introduce or conclude a video or animation.
 
The sixth and final step to using videos and animations in large group facilitation is to evaluate the impact they have on your facilitation and your audience. You want to assess how well the videos and animations helped you achieve your facilitation goals, how well they engaged and influenced your audience, and how well they fit with your facilitation style and techniques. You also want to learn from your experience, and to improve your skills and choices for using videos and animations in the future. For example, you can use surveys, feedback forms, or self-reflection to evaluate the impact of videos and animations.
