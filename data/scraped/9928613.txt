The school could not find a space inside the building for her Keep up to date with the latest stories with our WalesOnline newsletter We have more newsletters Keep up to date with the latest stories with our WalesOnline newsletter We have more newsletters A teacher who was still breastfeeding when she returned to work after maternity leave had to express milk in a car park because no room could be found for her in the school. Rebekka Gilpin, an official with the teaching union UTU, said: “This new mum ended up in her car at lunchtimes, in all weathers, without privacy or dignity expressing milk for her new baby. Surely this cannot be right.” The UTU is calling for an agreed framework allowing breastfeeding mums who wish to either nurse their baby or express milk to remain in the workplace to do so, reports BelfastLive. “There was nothing dignified about what this teacher was forced to do. I was actually shocked to think someone could be treated this way in this day and age,” said Ms Gilpin. “The issue arises in the first place because the cost of living crisis and low maternity pay force many mums back to work before their maternity entitlement has expired so many are still breastfeeding when they find themselves in school again. Most schools in such circumstances will find a mum a safe, warm place on the premises where she can express milk but the fact this situation was even able to arise shows that there is in fact no formalised support to ensure such teachers have protection in these circumstances. “When I was first made aware of this situation I immediately looked for guidance to schools governing such issues and was shocked to find there wasn’t any." She added: “With this teacher’s experience, it’s little wonder the UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world."
