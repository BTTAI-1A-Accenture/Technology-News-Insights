Everyone´s favourite Swedish furniture store, Ikea, has opened a new shop in Zenia Boulevard. However, before you get too excited, it´s not a full-on superstore like they have in Murcia, but rather a collection point for orders. It does potentially make life a little easier though, as you can buy online and pick up your purchases at the pick-up point, IKEA Zenia Boulevard. The pick-up point is located next to Casinos Mediterraneo and it is best to park in the park outside the area of ​​Norauto and Casinos Mediterraneo car parks, rather than underground. The pick-up point compliments the design store which is operating at the Boulevard. To encourage you to use the new service, for a limited time, using the Ikea pick-up point can also see you entered into a raffle for a 100 euro gift card.
