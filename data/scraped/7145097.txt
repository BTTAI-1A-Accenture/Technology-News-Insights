								and we want to ensure that every instrument we sell comes exactly how the manufacturer intended
								it to be. That is why Long & McQuade performs a quality control check for every stringed, brass,
								and woodwind instrument over $99 ordered online at Long-McQuade.com.
							 
								Our team of experienced staff will unbox your instrument and perform a detailed
								inspection to ensure it leaves our warehouse looking and playing great with our QC card signed
								and dated for your peace of mind.
							 
								We work hard to source the best instruments from around the world from the finest brands.
								It is important to us that you are completely satisfied with your new instrument purchase from
								day one onwards.
							 Unlike our free set-up, which is
								included within the first year of purchase, this process is done to have the instrument set to the
								factory specs rather than to each player's feel or preferences.

Because repairs can be very expensive in terms of parts and labour costs, manufacturers usually only provide one year limited warranties that generally only cover items that malfunction due to a manufacturer’s defect. With an important purchase such as a musical
instrument or piece of studio gear, however, many people want to have the peace of mind in knowing that  their investment will be protected should the product no longer be performing at 100%. Because of this, Long & McQuade provides our customers with a FREE one-year Performance Warranty on most of our products. The Long & McQuade Performance Warranty supplements the manufacturer’s warranty to ensure that our customers receive complete “no hassle” warranty coverage within their first year. Long & McQuade reserves the right to restrict the purchase of additional years of Performance Warranty. Used products come with a 3-month Long & McQuade Performance Warranty. Some products (i.e. computers, software, cymbals and other items) are covered only by the manufacturer‘s warranty. Consumables (i.e. strings, reeds, drum sticks, batteries, tubes, cross faders) are excluded as they are designed to be replaced. Cosmetic Damage, Accidental Damage, or problems caused by Humidity or Temperature Issues are not covered. Speakers damaged by overpowering are generally not covered. Our coverage does not provide compensation for loss of use. As of June 2018 the Performance Warranty is no longer transferable. The warranty is only valid in Canada. Some manufacturers provide warranties for longer than 1 year; however, these are usually limited warranties that do not provide the same coverage as the Long & McQuade Performance Warranty. Customers interested in more complete and convenient (but not necessarily longer) coverage are still able to purchase additional years of the Performance Warranty. If you are interested in receiving this coverage for longer than one year, you have the option of purchasing additional years of the Performance Warranty. The pricing is as follows:
