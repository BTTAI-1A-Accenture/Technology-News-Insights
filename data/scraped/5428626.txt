Mike's love for cookies pushed him to start his own cookie company. His thought was to provide 3 ways to enjoy his cookies. Shipping, a 24/7 vending machine, or a storefront open in Dogtown at 1136 Tamm Ave Saint Louis, MO 63139 & our second store front in Jefferson City, MO.  Evans joined Mary on Wednesday morning in the Show Me kitchen to share their plans for St. Patrick’s Day. From a DJ, to a fully stocked vending machine, and plenty of sweets in store, Alibi Cookies has your sweet tooth covered for the 17th!  Learn more at https://alibicookies.com/.
