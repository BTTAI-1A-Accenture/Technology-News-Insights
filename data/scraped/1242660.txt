TOKYO – Japanese police arrested a family of three in Hokkaido for allegedly decapitating a man and taking the head home. The victim’s body was discovered on July 2 in a hotel room in the city of Sapporo, the capital of Japan’s northernmost prefecture. The victim, 62-year-old Hitoshi Ura, was found in a "love hotel" in Susukino, a red-light district in Sapporo City. The story made waves in Japan earlier this week when police arrested Runa Tamura, 29, and her father, psychiatrist Osamu Tamura, on charges of mutilation of a corpse, theft, and disposal of a body.  Police also arrested Tamura's mother after searching the family’s home and discovering the victim’s head. Police collected clothes, a suitcase and other items as potential evidence.

Ura checked in with his companion around 11 p.m. on July 1. One person was captured on camera leaving with the large suitcase later that night. Police also suspect that the father dropped off and picked up Runa from the hotel. The footage appeared to show two women checking into the hotel. Ura was known in the red-light district as a cross-dresser who frequented bars and clubs. The grandfather of the suspect in the case was quoted in Shueisha Online and revealed unwanted sexual intercourse as a possible motive. The grandfather said after an alleged sexual assault he made Ura promise never to see his granddaughter again.
