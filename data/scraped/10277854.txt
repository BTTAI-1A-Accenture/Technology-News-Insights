According to Filmfare when Monica Bellucci was asked about

Aishwarya Rai Bachchan
too. Sheâs the actress with the beautiful green eyes. I had the privilege of meeting her in Cannes. Sheâs sweet.â When asked if she watched Hindi movies, Bellucci stated, âIâve watched quite a lot of Hindi films. Indian films are all over the world. My favourite film is Shekhar Kapurâs Bandit Queen.â Monica Bellucci at the time added, âI loved the way it was filmed and I wish I had been part of it. Iâd love to work with an Indian director but it depends on the role Iâm offered. Then Iâll be visiting India for the first time.â And many are not aware of the fact that Monica Bellucci was once also offered the role of Sonia Gandhi in the supposed Rajiv Gandhi biopic.
