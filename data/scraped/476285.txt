Twentieth Century Fox I don’t always like to classify certain movies as “dude” movies because anyone can enjoy a great film. However, I always hold a special place in my heart for movies that I’ve watched over and over again with my buddies. The Boondock Saints is one of those flicks. If you haven’t seen it (and I don’t understand why you haven’t at this point), buckle up. Fed up with crime in their hometown of Boston, twin brothers Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, respectively) decide to take matters into their own hands and dish out vigilante justice to gangsters in the city. All the while, FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) wrestles with whether or not to stop the brothers and if their actions are right or wrong. If you didn’t watch The Boondock Saints at least once in your college dorm, you didn’t do it right. This was one of the ultimate movies to hang out with your friends and revel in the bullets, hand tattoos, and a surprisingly good Ron Jeremy performance. Was I only the one who thought this movie made Boston look like an awesome place to live?
