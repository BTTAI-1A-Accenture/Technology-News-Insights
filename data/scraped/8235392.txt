WorkHorse alarm company software serves as a  single point of data entry, so alarm companies can manage their entire business from one  location via sales, eAgreements, RMR billing, field service, and in-field billing functionality. Featuring integrations with more than 30 monitoring centers as  well as Alarm.com, Alula, SecureCom, and SecureNet, the software now offers real-time integration with QuickBooks Online.  By linking and syncing data for real-time financials with QuickBooks Online—the most widely used accounting software  in the market, WorkHorse is your Single Point of Data Entry. The WorkHorse QB integration creates customers, products,  parts estimates, invoices, and payments. When customers are created in  WorkHorse, they automatically sync in Quickbooks Online,  cutting down the time it takes for your back office  to enter the data and keep up with financial audits. WorkHorse handles RMR Billing and Merchant Service  processing, which allows companies to continue to use Quickbooks Online and  have best in class RMR/Subscription billing. All invoices can automatically be  paid through an email, and through text messaging (coming December 2022). With  WorkHorse auto reminders and statements, collecting money from your customers  has never been easier.  “WorkHorse chose Quickbooks as the first partner for this  financial integration after studying the landscape and talking to hundreds of  Alarm Company Owners and Operators. It only made sense to have our first  financial system integration be with the most popular platform on the planet,”  said Steven Hayes, President of WorkHorse. About WorkHorse After owning an alarm  company for 12 years and struggling to find the right solution, Steven Hayes  knew there had to be a better way. He sold his alarm company and founded  WorkHorse in 2019.  WorkHorse now proudly serves the alarm industry, and is honored to serve our  growing network of integrators and central stations.   By clicking above, I acknowledge and agree to Endeavor Business Media’s Terms of Service and to Endeavor Business Media's use of my contact information to communicate with me about offerings by Endeavor, its brands, affiliates and/or third-party partners, consistent with Endeavor's Privacy Policy.
