A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Monday: ENGLAND Tottenham plays for the first time when the London club heads to Everton in the Premier League. Tottenham will be led by interim manager Cristian Stellini for a match that is significant at both ends of the standings. Tottenham can jump to third place — above Newcastle and Manchester United — with a win in the race for Champions League qualification, while third-to-last Everton can climb out of the relegation zone by avoiding defeat at Goodison Park. SPAIN Valencia has a chance to leave the relegation zone in the Spanish league with a home win against Rayo Vallecano. Valencia enters the match in second-to-last place, but it can move up to 15th if it earns the three points at Mestalla Stadium. Valencia has won two of its last four league games, losing the other two. Rayo is winless in its last six matches and needs a win to stay within range of the European places. The southern Madrid team is currently eighth. ITALY Torino visits Sassuolo in a midtable clash and Empoli hosts Lecce in a matchup of two clubs in the bottom half of Serie A. Torino has lost Ola Aina and Ivan Ilic for a month each due to injury. Former France center back Samuel Umtiti and midfielder Youssef Maleh are suspended for Lecce. ___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
