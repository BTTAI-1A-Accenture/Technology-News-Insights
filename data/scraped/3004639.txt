	AMC is working with its sub-distribution partners to reach agreements with operators representing more than 7,500 movie theaters globally to show the film. The Eras Tour will play at all Odeon locations throughout Europe. It already is set to play in more than 4,000 locations in U.S./Canada.

	Odeon said this morning that moviegoers can snap up tickets at its locations in the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Spain, Italy, Germany and Portugal. “In a nod to Taylor Swift’s 1989 album and her favourite number, 13, tickets in the UK and Ireland will be priced at £19.89/€19.89 for adults and £13.13/€13.13 for children,” the Odeon release said.

	We revealed awhile ago that presales for the concert movie were at $65M for the top three U.S. circuits (AMC, Regal and Cinemark), as well as for Mexico Cineopolis and Canada’s Cineplex. That threshold, at least on the domestic side, isn’t that far from presales for tentpoles such as Marvel’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($60M) and The Batman ($42M). Note, advance ticket sales are significantly higher now.  When the film was first announced on Aug. 31, it took less than 24 hours for the concert pic to shatter AMC’s U.S. record for the highest ticket-sales revenue during a single day in the chain’s 103-year history.

Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour hit tracking last week, with our sources saying at least $100M+ opening. The movie a guaranteed lock with women under 25. Note there are more conservative skeptics who believe that the pic could see a $75M opening because most Taylor Swift fans aren’t necessarily moviegoers, making that demographic hard to track.   
	Still at a $75M opening stateside, that’s arguably a record debut for a concert movie on the big screen, also outstripping the domestic runs of some of the highest-grossing concert films, i.e. Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert ($65.2M in 2008), Justin Bieber: Never Say Never ($73M in 2011) and Michael Jackson docu/concert pic This Is It ($72M in 2009).

	With studios shifting big movies out of 2023, i.e. Sony’s Ghostbusters sequel, Legendary/Warner Bros. Dune: Part Two and MGM’s Challengers due to the actors strike, AMC refused to stand on the sidelines. The No. 1 chain in the U.S. made a deal with the Swift family to distribute her concert movie.
