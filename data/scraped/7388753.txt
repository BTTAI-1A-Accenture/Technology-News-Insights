Android Headlines / Android News / Meta Verified: Everything you need to know To much backlash, Twitter introduced a paid verification system. For a monthly fee, users could gain access to additional features and perks along with the much-coveted verification checkmark. While this made Twitter the laughingstock of the social media world, it seems that Meta also came out with its own paid verification program. So, what is this program all about? Why should you get it? More importantly, is it worth your money? Here’s everything you need to know about this program. Meta Verified is a subscription service that will grant users on Facebook and Instagram exclusive perks and features. As time goes on, we won’t be surprised to see the list of perks increase. For now, there is a handful of goodies that the program will offer. For starters, there’s the coveted verification badge. You’ll have a unified verification badge that you’ll see on both your Facebook and Instagram profiles. With Meta Verified, you’ll have proactive account monitoring. This means that the company will keep an eye on your account to ensure that there aren’t any impersonators out there trying to emulate your account. As accounts gain notoriety, they see an increase in other accounts trying to impersonate them to scam unsuspecting individuals. If you’re Meta Verified, you’ll have exclusive access to a human assistant who will assist you with common issues. This means that you won’t need to navigate help forums and automated phone services to get assistance for most issues. Next, with the subscription, your posts will have a wider reach compared to free users. This means that you’ll have a boost in the algorithm making it easier for people to discover your posts. [UPDATE: The wider reach is only available for users in Australia and New Zealand. It’s not available for users in the US] Meta notes that the effect on your account will vary depending on your audience size. If you have a smaller following, then you’re likely to see a more substantial difference than if you have a larger following. Verified members will have exclusive stickers on their accounts. They’ll show up on Reels and Stories to show people that they’re verified. Each verified member will get 100 stars every month on Facebook. Stars are a proprietary Facebook currency that you can give to creators. They’re like Bits for Twitch. At the time of writing this post, it’s currently being tested in Australia and New Zealand. While that’s true, the prices are presented in USD, so we don’t expect it to be different when it eventually hits the states. If you sign up through the apps on Android or iOS, it costs $14.99/month (AUD 19.99). However, if you sign up for it through the web, then the price drops 20% to $11.99/month (AUD 24.99).  The reason for this is that Meta needs to pay 30% of its earnings to Apple and Google whenever someone signs up on their app store. So, Meta is charging more for people who sign up that way to offset this fee. At this time, there is no yearly subscription plan. Currently, only personal accounts are eligible for verification. This means that you can’t verify your business or organization just yet. However, that functionality will come down the pipeline. There’s already a verification program present on Facebook and Instagram. Meta stated that with Meta Verified, accounts that have previously been verified, will not be affected. However, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be changes in the long term. According to the company’s blog post, previously verified accounts won’t be affected in the short term, but it will eventually be “evolving the meaning of verified accounts on [its] apps.” This means that sometime down the road, Meta could bring a major change to accounts that are already verified. At the moment, we don’t know what the company plans on doing to previously-verified accounts. At the time of this writing, the program is only available to users in Australia and New Zealand [UPDATE: Now available in the US]. When it does make it to more markets, it will be a relatively involved process. This is because you’ll need to verify your identity before you can verify your account. You’ll need to submit a picture of your government-issued ID in order to sign up to be verified. You must also be at least 18 years old and enable two-factor authentication. If you’re signing up for Meta Verified, you’ll need to use an account that has a minimum posting history. This is to help ensure that only true users of the platform are applying to be verified. It will help minimize bots and trolls gaining verification Lastly, you’ll need to be at least 18 years old. There’s no way of getting past that, as you’ll need to present your ID when signing up. One thing to know is that when you sign up, the name on the account must match the name on your ID. This means that your account can only have your real name. After your account is verified, you can not change your name, photo, or account information without going through the verification process again. Meta didn’t mention whether ToS strikes have any weight on your application process. Just know that, if you’ve wracked up any serious strikes on your account, then you run the risk of having your verification application rejected. Make sure that you read through the terms of service if you have any questions. After you are verified, Meta didn’t state whether ToS strikes will have your account unverified or simply banned. Yes. Mark Zuckerberg announced that business accounts can now purchase a verification mark on either Facebook or Instagram. This will give businesses accounts access to exclusive features just like with main accounts. The pricing is a bit different from regular account verification. Verifying your Facebook business account or Instagram account will cost you $22/month. If you want to verify both of your accounts, it will cost you $35/month. At the time of writing this article, Meta is working on adding WhatsApp to Meta Verified. Some of the details are still murky, but we know that the company is working on letting you show your verification badge on your channels. This is only for business accounts and not for personal accounts. This is a way to let people know that the business they’re following is legitimate. The company is also working on changing the verification bade across WhatsApp from green to blue. This will make it match the verification badge present on Facebook and Instagram. Meta has been testing this program out in Australia and New Zealand. The company eventually brought it to the US market. It’s currently still in testing, so it will expand to other markets as time goes on. Copyright ©2024 Android Headlines. All Rights Reserved.
