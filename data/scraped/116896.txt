MANILA, Philippines — Dindin Manabat was lured from her old team Chery Tiggo by Akari for one reason alone – to score at will. And the 29-year Manabat did just that in powering the Chargers to a 25-18, 25-19, 23-25, 25-19 victory over the Army Black Mamba Lady Troopers yesterday to get into the win column in the Premier Volleyball League All-Filipino Conference at the PhilSports Arena. Manabat carried the team on her shoulders with a 23-point performance that included a blistering ace that sealed their first win after three losses in row. “We keep telling ourselves that if we win just one game, makukuha din namin momentum, magsusunod-sunod na ito at magigising kami,” said Manabat, a vital cog in Chery Tiggo’s memorable 2021 PVL title conquest in Bacarra, Ilocos Norte. It was also a fitting gift for Manabat and her husband, basketball coach Chico, on their eighth wedding anniversary. Army did everything it could to claim its first win as Honey Royse Tubino gave it her all and fired 20 hits. But it could only net a set for coach Randy Fallorina and his band of lady spikers, who remained winless in three starts. Chaira Mae Fermentilla and Princess Ezra Madrigal chipped in 13 and 10 hits, respectively, for the Jorge Souza de Brito-mentored Chargers.
