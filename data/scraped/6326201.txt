Learn more › Whether you’re trying to ramp up your spooky season decorations for Halloween or your room needs a lighting makeover, head over to Amazon to check out these early Prime Day deals on Govee smart lighting. We’re big fans of Govee’s products for both indoor and outdoor situations, and right now, you can save up to $50 on some of the company’s most popular products. So, ditch that clapped-out old floor lamp you’ve had since high school and upgrade your illumination. Note: Just about all these deals require clicking a box on the product page (right below the price) to activate a coupon, so make sure you do that to get the best price. This is the simplest, cheapest way to give your room an entirely new look. This 32.8-foot string of lights takes commands from an app or a wired remote. The lights can produce up to 16 million colors, sync up with your music, and perform up to 64 pre-programmed routines to make your living space more lively. They’re easy to hang, and you can add more strings if you need to cover more space. It’s a no-brainer at this price, and a great taste of the kind of deals we’ll be bringing to you throughout Oct. 11-12.   Executive editor, gear and reviews Stan Horaczek is the executive gear editor at Popular Science. He oversees a team of gear-obsessed writers and editors dedicated to finding and featuring the newest, best, and most innovative gadgets on the market and beyond. He lives in upstate New York with his family, a three-legged dog, and a truly unreasonable collection of hundreds of vintage film cameras and lenses.  Popular Science started writing about technology more than 150 years ago. There was no such thing as “gadget writing” when we published our first issue in 1872, but if there was, our mission to demystify the world of innovation for everyday readers means we would have been all over it. Here in the present, PopSci is fully committed to helping readers navigate the increasingly intimidating array of devices on the market right now.

Our writers and editors have combined decades of experience covering and reviewing consumer electronics. We each have our own obsessive specialties—from high-end audio to video games to cameras and beyond—but when we’re reviewing devices outside of our immediate wheelhouses, we do our best to seek out trustworthy voices and opinions to help guide people to the very best recommendations. We know we don’t know everything, but we’re excited to live through the analysis paralysis that internet shopping can spur so readers don’t have to.
