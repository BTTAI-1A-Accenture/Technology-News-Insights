 Last week I read a pretty bold thought here on #LinkedIn about digital nomads having fewer responsibilities. I believe the author’s intention wasn’t to put digital nomads in a bad light, but I do want to share in this week's newsletter why I disagree with this. As a remote work advocate and podcast host, I get to talk to many digital nomads from all walks of life. Reading a post like that instantly activated my digital-nomad-protection-mother-instinct and it showed me how much I care about our community. In fact, EVERY SINGLE episode on my podcast exemplifies how challenging this lifestyle is and that being a responsible human is a must.  I often wonder if people and companies understand what it really means to be a digital nomad. This question excites me so much and it truly motivates me to keep interviewing digital nomads and figure out what it takes for them to live a successful lifestyle. We talk about day-to-day things, professional growth and well-being and I see very aware, caring and humble people. The digital nomads I talk with on my podcast and outside the show aren’t reckless people doing random things. So wild statements that show otherwise kinda piss me off because it gives the WRONG IMPRESSION of who the people are in our community and what this lifestyle is about. So let’s take this week's podcast guests as an example. I interviewed Chase Warrington he is a digital nomad working remotely for Doist and is the host of his podcast About Abroad. He travels with his wife and cutest dog Koda and loves living in different homes, including a campervan. Chase is a leader in our community and at work. He is responsible for the well-being of many people, some are digital nomads and others are remote workers. But he is also a partner, a parent of his dog and a citizen of the world caring about the planet. He can only be his awesome self when he takes good care of himself.  🔗 Listen to the full episode with Chase to find out yourself!  Today’s episode shows my point even stronger and that’s why I want to voice it now in this newsletter.  I interviewed a black digital nomad gay couple traveling with their toddler. We had a fun chat about daily family life things but also about more serious stuff.  👀 Find locations where they feel safe 👀 Deal with rejection because they are gay. In some countries, parents didn’t want to hang out with them after they found out they were gay. YES, that happened! 🤯 👀 Not share the same last name so it’s not obvious they are a gay couple 👀 Separate in immigration lines entering some countries just to out of safety for their family 👀 They have A TON of responsibilities and they are like me and all other podcast guests, digital nomads. This conversation really inspired me and I am so grateful   🔗 Listen to the full episode with Corritta and Mia to find out more about their lifestyle  PLEASE people and companies, if you are talking about digital nomads REMEMBER that you are speaking about a GLOBAL COMMUNITY that attracts PEOPLE of ALL nationalities, cultures, colors, shapes, genders, sexualities and so much more. This is the beauty of this lifestyle and something I always point out to people that are interested in this lifestyle or just curious. A big thanks to my guests for having a beautiful and open conversation and helping me show what is really happening behind the scenes.   And thank you for reading this newsletter.
