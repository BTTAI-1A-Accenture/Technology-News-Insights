Published on By The Eselu of Iselu, Yewa North Local Government Area, Ogun State, Oba Akintunde Akinyemi, has slammed the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ladi Adebutu, over an alleged insulting comment against the Yewa/Awori traditional institution. Adebutu was said to have tackled the Yewa/Awori Obas for praying for the Lagos West Senator, Olamilekan Adeola, who is now contesting the Ogun West senatorial seat under the All Progressives Congress, APC. DAILY POST recalls that some of the Obas had in 2022 kicked against Adeola, describing him as a non-indigene. During a political function recently, Adebutu had expressed worries that the Obas are now queuing behind the Lagos Senator, ignoring their âtrue sonâ, Ganiyu Dada of the PDP. Reacting in an open letter, Eselu said he became sad the moment he heard and saw âthe video where Hon. Ladi Adebutu, publicly embarrassed some Yewa-Awori Obas who prayed for Senator Olamilekan Adeola.â Oba Akinyemi described Adebutu as a serial loser in Ogun State politics, saying âhe managed to win the House of Representatives position which was facilitated some years ago by Otunba Gbenga Daniel, a former Governor of Ogun State.â According to the monarch, since Adebutu left the National Assembly, he had been struggling to win one post or the other, alleging that âhis lack of respect for elders and many politicians has always made him a failure.â Eselu told Adebutu that the goodwill he is enjoying in Ogun State is due to the love people have for his father, Chief Kensington Adebutu (Baba Ijebu). âHe talks rudely and carelessly and this has made some political leaders in Ogun State abandon him. He is so arrogant that he always wants his opinions to override other people’s opinions. He is the reason why the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, cannot win in Ogun State after eight years of Otunba Gbenga Daniel as Ogun State Governor,â he said. The Oba told Yewa-Awori traditional rulers that âAdebutu does not deserve to be elected as Governor of Ogun State, fearing that âif he wins, he will be ordering people to beat up Kabiyesis. In view of his mannerless behaviour, Yewa Traditional Council takes his outburst seriously and we will ensure he is not received and welcomed in our Council.â He spoke further, âWe, Yewa traditional rulers have endorsed a man who is a Prince and who has respect for traditional rulers in the person of His Excellency, Prince Dapo Abiodun, whose first term in Office has brought tremendous developments to all the nooks and crannies of our dear Ogun State. âAlso, we stand on our endorsement for Chief Olamilekan Adeola (Yayi). He deserves our absolute support on the day of election.â Igbo elders are working for Nnamdi Kanu’s freedom – Iwuanyanwu Recruiting 1 million personnel won’t solve Nigeria’s security challenges â Herders to presidential candidates Ogun orders illegal occupants out of forest reserves Ogun communities receive N206m for infrastructure Economic hardship: Protest can’t solve Nigeriaâs problems – Ogun chiefs Man arrested for stabbing girlfriendâs brother in Ogun Funmi Branco: Of Ogun roads and a listening governor NYSC distances from death of Ogun Poly student Copyright Â© Daily Post Media Ltd
