Tales of small, slightly hairy “ape-men” may be similar to North American stories about Bigfoot or Sasquatch, passed down for so long that they become part of the culture. While doing fieldwork on Indonesia’s Flores Island in the early 2000s, anthropologist Gregory Forth frequently spoke to the locals living in the mountains. They told him that they sometimes caught glimpses of a small humanoid animal, a kind of “ape-man,” short in stature and hairy.  Forth believes it’s possible that an early type of human—whose bones paleoanthropologists discovered in a mountain cave on Flores—could have survived the past 50,000 years in the isolated region. In 2022, he published a book, Between Ape and Human: An Anthropologist on the Trail of a Hidden Hominoid, about what he learned from the Flores islanders. However, paleoanthropologists, who look for evidence explaining human evolution, are far from convinced. The chances that Flores could be home to living descendants of an extinct human species is vanishingly small, because no solid evidence of such reported “ape-men” exists, paleontologists say. In 2004, a group of paleoanthropologists announced in the journal Nature that they had discovered a new link in the human evolutionary tree in a remote mountain cave on Flores. The paper’s description of the species—an early human that walked upright, and had a remarkably small body structure—was very familiar to Forth’s. The researchers nicknamed the individual a “hobbit” after the small characters in the novel The Lord of the Rings.  “When the reports started coming out, I was quite amazed [at] ... what paleoanthropologists were describing, and indeed reconstructing—[it] sounded very much like what the Lio people had been describing to me the previous summer,” Forth tells The Debrief in a February 2023 interview. Scientists named it Homo floresiensis after the island where they found its bones, including a mostly intact skull, plus bones of the legs, hands, feet, and pelvis. All were from a single female. The subsequent unearthing of bones from 12 hobbit individuals, as well as tools found in the cave, revealed that these small people lived during the Late Pleistocene era, a period of time overlapping with other living human species, including Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens (modern humans). Like the other members of the genus Homo, evidence shows the Flores species also used stone tools. However, this human was different; while the other species more closely resemble each other, this 3.5-foot hominin had large teeth and feet, and a small skull—which held a brain the size of a chimpanzee’s. ✅ Know Your Terms: Hominin refers to all humans, plus our ancestral species who walked upright on two feet (including members of the genera Homo, Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and Ardipithecus). Hominid is a broader term encompassing all great apes and their ancestors, including humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans. Their skeletons are also unusual because they share close traits with older, more primitive species, like Australopithecus afarensis, as a 2012 Nature article describes. Yet that Australopithecus species went extinct about 2.8 million years before the hobbit, so researchers are still investigating the reasons for the similarities. Researchers theorize that a human species reached Flores about one million years ago. Over several thousand years, they must have developed dwarfism, living as small people on the island until they eventually went extinct, roughly 50,000 years ago.  Why Experts Think the Flores Hobbit Is Extinct Evidence of these people could still be found, argues Forth, who specialized in social anthropology, and was a professor at the University of Alberta, Canada, before he retired.  “Bear in mind that a lot of species have been known to local people (in the vicinity of Flores, for example, the Komodo dragon) before they were accepted by scientists,” he tells Popular Mechanics by email. For proof of continued existence, scientists need to see a specimen, he says, but he knows anthropologists aren’t rushing to Flores to seek out hard evidence of a living descendent of these hobbits. That’s because this concept doesn’t make sense to most paleoanthropologists, says Matthew Tocheri of the Smithsonian Institution’s Human Origins Program. His research focuses on the evolutionary history and functional form of the human and great ape family, especially H. floresiensis. Tocheri says it’s thrilling to have found a very unusual species of human. “I think it’s fair to say that it sort of represents a time of this big shift in paleoanthropology generally ... and it really kind of shook the foundations of the discipline itself,” he tells Popular Mechanics. Tocheri also heads the Human Origins program at Lakehead University in Ontario, Canada. “I would be one of the most excited people in the world if Homo floresiensis is still around,” Tocheri says. “But I wouldn’t waste my professional resources in a search. It’s incredibly, abysmally unlikely that they’re still around.” For a population to remain viable and reproduce, you need thousands of healthy breeding adults for many generations. Tocheri wonders why no one living in the mountainous region of Flores has encountered many more of these ape-people—or at least found the traces that such a large population would leave. Even with their lesser size and weight, H. floresiensis is considered a “big mammal” that would produce relatively large, noticeable biological wastes, such as defecation and urine. These clues are noticeable with other animals of comparable size, he says. And with a presumably large population lasting until the present day, these folks wouldn’t be very well-hidden—yet locals seem to have seldomly caught sight of them, Tocheri adds. He thinks the tales of small, slightly hairy “ape-men” may be similar to North American stories about Bigfoot or Sasquatch, passed down for so long that they become part of the culture, and even embedded in the psyche. Perhaps islanders could be seeing some other primate and mistaking it for this ape-man, he says. ✅ Why do Flores humans have a small stature? It’s likely the result of developing dwarfism after being isolated on this remote island for many thousands of years, researchers believe. Like other animals, such as the diminutive elephants of Flores and even a population of relatively small modern humans living there currently, dwarfism is often part of the Island Rule. Some species can become smaller, while others become larger due to changes in a remote island’s levels of resources or predators over long time periods. This phenomenon also occurs on other islands around the world, such as the Channel Islands off the coast of southern California, which scientists believe were once home to a pygmy mammoth—it was just the height of a person. On the other hand, “how can you prove something doesn’t exist? You can’t,” Tocheri says. Finding a physical specimen first isn’t the only way to make a discovery, according to Forth. “For me as an anthropologist, evidence that Flores Islanders have actually seen living creatures that closely correspond to their descriptions of ‘ape-men’, and therefore Homo floresiensis, is the best among several explanations for what they told me,” he says.   Forth isn’t equating the unearthing of H. floresiensis bones with a definite conclusion about the hobbits still existing. But he’s not ruling out the possibility. Such a discovery in the genus Homo “would be extraordinary. Not only would it contradict the current orthodoxy; it would also overturn current theories of hominin evolution and raise questions about what it means to be ‘human’—or ‘not quite human,’” Forth says. The finding would also demonstrate to people in the academic world that “ordinary folk” have knowledge of local species, which scientists—who flit in and out of an area for a specific study—often do not, he adds. Since the hobbit was discovered, the field of paleoanthropology has seen rapid progress, such as the discovery of the species Homo naledi of South Africa and the Siberian Denisovans, who may be closely related to Neanderthals. Scientists have also sequenced Neanderthal DNA fragments from bones, and identified Neanderthal and Denisovan genetic codes in modern humans—which means the three species once interbred. The closest any former human species comes to still being alive is by being a part of us. So the idea that an entirely extinct human is still living clandestinely among us is shocking, Tocheri says. He agrees with Forth that it would be amazing to find the descendants of these people—considered gone 500 centuries or so ago—still populating a small pocket on Flores. 👀  What’s unique about humans in the Homo genus? The genus Homo denotes the beginning of the traits that make us Homo sapiens what we are: a larger skull (that can hold a large brain); a skeletal structure that normally stands upright and walks on two feet; fully opposable thumbs; and hands that can employ both a powerful grip and fine motor skills. Members of Homo also have the ability to make and use tools. Homo habilis is the first member of this genus, emerging in the fossil record as early as 2.4 million years ago. Except for modern humans, all six members that currently fall within the Homo genus (plus two potential members, Homo naledi and Homo rudolfensis) are extinct. Before finding the hobbit, researchers looked at human origins in a slightly more linear way. They knew some species likely branched off from earlier relatives—an effect of evolutionary pressures like climate change—in different times and places. For example, H. sapiens evolved mainly from Homo heidelbergensis, but so did Homo neanderthalis. Various species living at the same time may have met and interbred as well. We know that our own species has some Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA. All this simultaneous evolution and intermingling makes the traditional “family tree” more of an interconnected bush, Tocheri explains.  Once H. floresiensis entered the picture however, it threw a further kink into evolutionary anthropologists’ understanding, because this species shared distinct characteristics with both Homo genus members and with far more distant cousins on lower branches. Some researchers think hobbits may have evolved from an early Asian Homo erectus—likely one of our own ancestors. Or it may have developed from Homo habilis, an earlier, smaller-brained hominin. DNA evidence from these hobbits would be an informative find, but genetic matter has been impossible to extract from teeth and bones, a 2018 Nature paper explains. Tocheri says he personally would love to know the common ancestor of both H. floresiensis and modern humans. “What’s really interesting is, roughly about 45,000–46,000 years ago, we do see evidence [in the same place] that we think is from us. So what happened? Like, is it possible that can we can we find some evidence that will show us that modern humans were on the island at the same time [as H. floresiensis]? ... Did we play any role in their extinction? … It’s within the realm of possibility that, if we keep searching, things will turn up.”  A host of tantalizing research questions about hobbits beckon researchers: How did they survive, what did they eat, and how strong were their bones, for instance? Answering these can paint a more detailed picture of the Flores hobbit and enhance our understanding of humanity’s roots, Tocheri says.
