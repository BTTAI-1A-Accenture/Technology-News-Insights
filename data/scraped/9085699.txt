Surround sound is a feature that gamers don't appreciate until they experience it. Gaming headsets supporting surround sound or spatial audio are a simpler alternative to expensive, elaborate, multi-component surround sound systems. With the same audio capabilities, headsets are generally more affordable, easier to set up and use, and more mobile as they are not confined to a single desk or console. Some audiophiles argue that headphones are not true surround sound. Still, the best surround sound gaming headset options are much more accessible for gamers, especially those playing online with friends.
     Not all headphones are made equal. Here are some of the best choices that are available today to satisfy buyers' ears.                      When shopping for a new headset, looking at gaming-specific options is not even a requirement. Even so, headsets tailored for gamers will offer the fastest, most reliable connection and versatile audio performance. With the addition of surround sound, virtual boots crunching softly through leaves, an arrow whistling through the air, or the ground-quaking rumble of a distant explosion will be more authentic.
                          The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 is hands-down the top wireless gaming headset with surround sound. Players who want breathtakingly powerful and immersive audio without the staggeringly high price tag will appreciate the Arctis Nova 7. This headset can be appreciated on all consoles, including PlayStation, Nintendo, Xbox, PC, and mobile devices.
     SteelSeries gaming mice are as high quality as the rest of the company's popular PC accessories, but which ones should players pick up for themselves?                      SteelSeries' 360-degree Spatial Audio tech powers the surround sound in the Arctis Nova 7, which is also compatible with PlayStation 5's Tempest 3D and Microsoft Spatial Sound. Although the soundscape is not the most balanced between the lows and the highs, this headset handles game audio fantastically. In competitive games like Apex Legends, where good spatial awareness gives gamers an edge, this headset accurately renders footsteps and enemy movement and makes them easy to place.
                         Another fascinating feature of the Arctis 7 is SteelSeries' Sonar software. The app powers a parametric equalizer, which takes all-around sound one step further. Users can customize the prevalence of in-game environmental noise, including footsteps and explosions.
                         Overall, the Arctis 7 is the best surround sound gaming headset for under $200. It guarantees an incredible audio experience for just about any gamer.
     Now upgraded with breakthrough innovations in audio and connectivity, the new Logitech G ASTRO A50 X LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Headset + Base Station is the new flagship high-performance gaming headset for console players.

In gaming, comfort, sound, connectivity, communications, and compatibility are the keys gamers look for in an audio solution. The A50 X combines the design of the original A50, a favorite of console gamers everywhere, with four breakthrough innovations in the console headset market.                      With its versatile base station, the Astro A50 offered wide-ranging connectivity to PCs and consoles. However, with the new Astro A50 X, Logitech's headset accommodates the most complicated gaming setups, utilizing HDMI 2.1 switching. Not only can listeners seamlessly move between consoles and PCs, but it also supports spatial audio on all platforms. 
                         The A50 X looks nearly identical to its predecessor, with its trademark piping allowing its ear cups to slide upwards and downwards. Sporting a non-detachable flip-to-mute mic, the headset doesn't seem especially compact, but its weight is reasonable at 363 grams. Some gamers find the default ear cushions a bit scratchy, but they can be replaced with leatherette alternatives sold on Logitech's website. These mod kits also include different headbands with matching materials.
     Astro takes versatility to the next level with its A50 X, a wireless gaming headset that's tailor-made for the three major platforms.                      Logitech's mission to make the A50 X a truly universal wireless headset for all sources is mostly successful. Instead of the optical and analog inputs on the back of the A50's base station, the A50 X relies on HDMI and USB connections. Using the headset with a PC is straightforward, requiring gamers only to make a single USB connection. Things are more complicated for Xbox and PlayStation gamers since users must feed an HDMI signal from consoles to the base station and then back to TVs or monitors with a passthrough port. Causing some cable management headaches, USB cables from consoles are necessary for full multiplayer chatting capabilities. Even though setup requires some planning, gamers can then use buttons on the headset to switch between sources or pair with additional Bluetooth devices. 
                         The A50 X's sound quality is better than ever, thanks to the introduction of 40 mm graphene drivers. This thin, light material rejects distortion and enables a headset to produce a more natural and balanced soundscape. Spatial audio also sounds more convincing, and the A50 X is a great match for Dolby Atmos and Sony's 3D audio platform. Gamers can switch between platforms without sacrificing spatial audio compatibility. 
                         One annoyance of A50 headsets that Logitech has yet to solve involves the metal contacts on the base station. Gamers will still need to very carefully position the headset for successful charging. Regardless, the base station's ability to handle any source makes the A50 X the best surround-sound gaming headset for multi-platform gamers. 
     The HyperX Cloud Orbit S gaming headset is luxury-level audio at a midrange-level price. It utilizes powerful planar magnetic drivers from Audeze, the same drivers employed in $400+ headphones. The HyperX offers 3D spatial audio and head tracking, plus multi-system compatibility thanks to three included connectivity options. The detachable mic subdues background noises including keyboard cracks and other disturbances, while the headset's active noise cancelation keeps players immersed deeply in game audio.                       The HyperX Cloud Orbit S is one of the most premium gaming headsets gamers can add to a setup. Using the same drivers as the discontinued Audeze Mobius, this headset provides an audiophile headphone experience in a gaming headset package. The Cloud Orbit S utilizes planar magnetic drivers instead of most headsets' typical dynamic drivers. While this doesn't make them automatically sound better, these drivers provide some of the best sound quality on a gaming headset for under $400.
     HyperX has a range of gaming mice: lightweight, wired, wireless, or a combination of the three. These are the best HyperX gaming mice in 2024.                      However, sound quality alone is not why gamers look at this guide for the best surround sound gaming headset, and the Cloud Orbit S does not disappoint. This headset uses Waves Nx 3D audio tech to create the standard 7.1 surround sound used in many video games and a simulated 3D audio environment using head tracking. The head-tracking capabilities, which make gamers feel more immersed in environments, set the Cloud Orbit S apart from the crowd. However, the true surround sound experience is incompatible with consoles, so gamers must use it on a PC to get the most out of this headset.
     The Logitech G432 is a wired headset designed for gaming. The on-ear headphones deliver a frequency response area of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and the large 50-millimeter audio drivers produce a sound capable of an immersive gaming experience.

The headset comes with support for advanced DTS surround sound, which can help gamers locate enemies thanks to precise positional audio and a 3D soundscape. The headset's microphone includes a convenient flip-to-mute function, and volume controls on the left ear cup. The Logitech G432 supports most devices with a 3.5 mm connector to USB DAC input.                      The Logitech G432 proves that gamers do not need to spend an arm and a leg to get an excellent surround-sound gaming experience. Of course, some concessions must be made at this lower price point. However, for gamers who want a headset that will sound pretty good, feel comfortable to wear for long gaming sessions, and still provide surround sound, the G432 is the perfect candidate.
     Battle-tested and reliable, the best wired headsets can make a world of difference when gaming on the Xbox, Playstation, or PC.                      This is not the best-sounding gaming headset out there, but for under $50, it is incredibly enjoyable to game with and listen to music. In games, sounds are easy to pick out, and it doesn't feel like any frequencies are fighting each other; however, for the surround sound support, gamers must use it on a PC. While listening to music, the shortcomings of the G432 are a bit more apparent, with the lows overpowering the highs, but for fans of bassy music, it sounds more than adequate.
                         Luckily, many budget gaming headsets, like the Razer Kraken V3 X, offer similar performance and surround sound support in the same price range. But the G432 just barely beats it out with better spatial sound and a more balanced sound profile.
     Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2 MAX is a feature-rich gaming headset. The headset is compatible with Xbox consoles, PS5, PC, Nintendo Switch, and other platforms. It features a wireless, low-latency 2.4 GHz connection via a supplied adapter.

The Stealth 600 Gen 2 MAX headset has over 48 hours of battery life, a high-quality generation 2 microphone for clear voice communications, and amplified 50 mm speakers for powerful audio. It also supports the company's proprietary Superhuman Hearing feature.                      One struggle many wireless gaming headsets face is offering compatibility with all platforms in a single version. Improving on the original Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2, the Max boasts improved battery life and a USB RF dongle that works with PCs and most consoles. Just as impressive, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max supports a variety of virtual surround and spatial audio formats.
                         Despite its large earcups and permanent external flip-to-mute microphone, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max has a sleek and compact shape. Unfortunately, some gamers with larger heads find the headset a bit too snug, though in most cases, the headband loosens over time. Surprisingly, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max is not the best at passive noise cancellation, with the fabric on the ear cushions forming a less-than-secure seal. On the positive side, Turtle Beach went to great lengths to prevent the sides of the headset and headband from interfering with glasses.
                         Instead of forcing buyers to purchase versions specific to certain consoles, the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max's connectivity is remarkably versatile. With a switch on the wireless adapter, gamers can toggle between Xbox and USB modes, which also accommodates PCs and PlayStation consoles. The Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max works with many surround and spatial sound formats to make gaming audio more dynamic, including Windows Sonic, Dolby Atmos, and Sony's Tempest 3D.
     The Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is the company's first premium gaming headset, boasting active noise cancellation and a suite of customizable features.                      The Max in the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max could refer to its platform compatibility or impressive battery life. Gamers can expect close to 48 hours of playtime with the headset, which is enough to go a week or more without recharging for many gamers.
                         Turtle Beach typically employs excellent gaming headset microphones, even on its affordable models. The Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max is no exception, picking up on a chatter's voice without distortion. That's true whether a gamer is shouting or whispering.
                         While larger heads may find the Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max restricting, it does an excellent job handling surround sound on PCs and consoles. For any buyer who loathes using multiple headsets, the Turtle Stealth 600 Gen 2 Max is an incredible value at a mid-range price.
     There are few things worse than hearing screaming siblings or barking dogs during intense, competitive game matches. It’s tough on teammates, but also makes it incredibly difficult for users to have fun during a game! Luckily, the EPOS H3PRO Hybrid is here to cut out the excess noise so that players can focus on winning.                      Gamers can experience surround sound without spending a fortune, but audiophile-grade options often maximize its potential. The Epos H3Pro Hybrid has qualities budget headsets usually lack, including versatile wired and wireless connectivity. Its closed-off design and active noise cancellation maintain the immersion that directional audio needs to shine.
                         The H3Pro Hybrid has a distinctive appearance, with a headband extending halfway down each earcup. Gamers can quickly detach and reattach the external boom mic using magnets. Despite its powerful sound, the H3Pro Hybrid weighs only 308 grams, partly because it relies on more plastic than some high-end competitors. Regardless, its neutral and natural soundscape confirms its premium status. 
                         With Hybrid in its name, this Epos headset implies that it serves many roles in a gaming setup. Sure enough, it ships with a compact USB wireless dongle that connects to PlayStation consoles and PCs. Xbox gamers will have to utilize an analog audio cable for controllers, but they won't suffer any loss in audio fidelity. Bluetooth connectivity is also available, and gamers can mix sound from mobile phones with other sources. Some users complain that the signal from the USB adapter is weak, but gamers can expect a low-latency connection range of 60 feet in most scenarios.
                         Buyers with PCs will be able to fine-tune more settings in the Epos Gaming Suite and change the default sound from stereo to 7.1 channels. Regardless of the platform, gamers will find that the H3Pro Hybrid protects listeners from potential distractions with stellar passive and active noise cancellation. Users may find that the headset forms such a tight seal on the ears that activating ANC is unnecessary. 
                         The Epos H3Pro Hybrid is a top-tier headset that more than justifies recently discounted prices. Its balanced surround sound excels on every platform, regardless of whether a user is gaming, listening to music, or watching movies. 
     The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless gaming headset from SteelSeries is a serious gamer's tool. A gamer who wants the convenience and quality of a feature-rich wireless gaming headset need not look elsewhere. The headset's premium high-fidelity drivers deliver a clear soundscape and a fully customizable experience with the Sonar Software. It supports 360-degree spatial audio for a more immersive gaming experience and helps users hear every audio cue around them clearly. 

With active noise-canceling technology enhanced by a four-mic hybrid system, gamers can use transparency mode to tune out any annoying background noises.                      Chaotic environments can quickly ruin the immersive gaming experience surround sound headsets provide. As with most active noise-cancelling headsets, the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is pricey but outputs uninterrupted spatial audio on PCs and consoles. In addition, it includes a DAC that allows gamers to mix sound from several different sources.
                         The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless has above-average build quality to justify its steep asking price. While much of the device is plastic to keep its weight reasonable, sensitive points on the headband are reinforced with metal. The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is flexible enough for any head size, but to block out outside noise, the leatherette ear cushions aren't the most breathable. Gamers will find that the cheaper Arctis Nova 7's cushions reject body heat more effectively, but it comes at the expense of passive noise cancellation.
     Noise Canceling is an important feature for high-end headphones of late. Here are some of Game Rant's best picks available to buy right now.                      Spatial audio and surround sound formats can confuse gamers, but the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless attempts to please everyone. Buyers will want to purchase the appropriate version for their setup, but the headset works with Dolby Atmos and Sony's Tempest 3D. With a DAC consisting of two USB ports, PC gamers can experiment with the software-driven spatial audio in the Sonar app. Wireless performance is rock-solid, and the DAC will constantly charge an additional battery for up to 36 hours of playtime.
                         With a series of internal microphones, the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless constantly scans rooms and generates sound pulses to neutralize unwanted noise. The active noise-cancelling abilities of the headset rank it among the best gaming headsets, like the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro. Microphone clarity on the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is equally impressive, though its AI noise reduction abilities are slightly subpar.
                         The Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is expensive, but its comprehensive spatial audio support and active noise-cancelling put it in a class of its own.
     The Razer Kraken Kitty V2 Pro brings the same sound quality as previous Kraken headsets with a stylish and versatile new look. The Kraken Kitty V2 Pro features interchangeable ears including accessories for cats, bears, and bunnies. The ears along with rings on the headset's earcups all sync with Razer's popular Chroma RGB lighting system, ideal for streamers and gamers. 
The TriForce 50mm drivers on the Kraken Kitty V2 Pro provide an ideal balance between high, mid, and low tones with plenty of volume. The detachable HyperClear Cardioid Mic reduces background noise and captures voices without interference.                       RGB headsets often lack the extensive lighting of many illuminated gaming keyboards and mice. Perhaps that's because listeners won't often see themselves wearing these devices. Thankfully, the Razer Kraken Kitty V2 Pro has more than a dash of RGB effects with cat, bear, and bunny ears flashing on top of its headband. Also, this wired headset sounds as good as it looks, thanks to powerful and balanced sound with support for THX spatial audio.
     The Razer Kraken V3 X combines a comfortable design, decent audio quality, and excellent microphone clarity for an incredibly affordable price.                       Besides its RGB ears, the Kraken Kitty V2 Pro resembles other Kraken headsets, with well-padded circular earcups. To appeal to more buyers, the headset is available in black and quartz, but its lighting can transform its appearance. The Kraken Kitty V2 Pro has obvious appeal as streaming gear where viewers can appreciate its interchangeable RGB components. Users are free to customize Chroma lighting effects using the Synapse software and implement lighting that reacts to stream events. The Kraken Kitty V2 Pro connects to PCs, PlayStations, and docked Nintendo Switches with a USB cable, but in Cosplay Mode, streamers can attach it to an external power bank. 
                         Streamers will use the Kraken Kitty V2 Pro for more than just gaming audio, and its soundscape doesn't just amplify explosions. Mid-tones are somewhat subtle, but lows and highs are equally clear, which benefits its support for THX 7.1 spatial audio. PC users will need to run the Synapse app for more dynamic in-game sound, but in a stereo configuration, it also excels with the PS5's Tempest 3D technology. Unfortunately, the headset's USB connection is not supported by the Xbox, so gamers can't use it for Dolby Atmos or Windows Sonic on Microsoft's console. 
                         Microphone quality is also critical for streamers and content creators. Of course, using a standalone microphone is always preferable, but the removable cardioid mic on the Kraken Kitty V2 Pro effectively isolates voices. The rest of the headset is not as portable since its rather stiff USB cable is permanently attached. 
                         Whether a buyer is an internet celebrity or a casual gamer looking for a more stylish headset, the Razer Kraken Kitty V2 Pro impresses. Its limited connectivity shuts out Xbox gamers, but the headset's excellent multichannel audio will delight large audiences. 
     Razer brings the performance, style, and comfort the peripheral brand is known for to Xbox gamers with the Razer Kairo Pro wireless headset. Thanks to the Razer TriForce 50mm drivers, listeners feel powerful bass along with distinctive low, mid, and high tones.

The Razer Kaira Pro is one of the most comfortable gaming headsets ever designed with memory foam ear cushions and a soft padded headband that makes users forget they are wearing any device. The Kaira Pro will connect wirelessly to the Xbox or most Bluetooth-compatible devices.                       There are relatively few wireless Xbox headsets that can connect to the console without additional adapters. Gamers looking for an alternative to the official Microsoft Xbox Wireless Headset should consider the Razer Kaira Pro, which offers improved build and sound quality. The Kaira Pro also natively supports Windows Sonic spatial audio and Dolby Atmos after purchasing a license. 
     Discover the best Xbox Series X headsets with Game Rant's expert guide.                      The Kaira Pro utilizes round memory foam earcups covered with a breathable mesh fabric. Since the cushions surround the ears completely, the headset does an admirable job of blocking background noise. Padding on the headband isn't quite so luxurious, but gamers without glasses will find the headset's fit forgiving. The Kaira Pro is fairly lightweight at 330 grams, and swiveling earcups and a detachable boom mic make traveling with it feasible. 
                         Using an Xbox-specific app, gamers can change the Chroma RGB effects on the Kaira Pro's earcups and adjust other EQ settings. PC gamers must purchase an Xbox Wireless Adapter, provided they don't already use one for an Xbox controller. However, using the Kaira Pro with a Windows PC involves sacrifices like having to resort to physical controls to adjust volume levels. The lack of wired connectivity further limits the cross-platform capabilities of the headset, but it does offer Bluetooth 5.0. Strangely, the external boom mic doesn't work when connected to a mobile device, but the Kaira Pro includes an additional integrated mic for those scenarios. 
                         Like other gaming headsets, the Kaira Pro's default sound mix excels most with bass effects. Still, when Windows Sonic or Dolby Atmos is active, the soundscape is balanced enough for gamers to recognize approaching danger. Even more impressive is its microphone, which captures the lower registers of voices to avoid multiplayer chatter sounding nasally.
                         While this Razer headset isn't the best option for buyers with multiple systems, it's the perfect audio gear for Xbox consoles. Game Rant's review of the Kaira Pro praised its hassle-free wireless connectivity, spatial audio support, and superior microphone clarity. 
     The INZONE H5 is Sony's stellar wireless gaming headsets for PS5 and PC gamers. 360 Spatial Audio makes gaming more immersive by sending sounds in directions matching dynamic virtual environments. The INZONE H5 is exceptionally lightweight and comfortable despite its powerful 40 mm drivers and ample volume.                      Sony's Tempest 3D works with any stereo headset, but the Inzone H5 maximizes the PS5's audio capabilities. The Inzone H5 appeals most to buyers who find the popular Sony Pulse 3D somewhat uncomfortable or lacking features. However, it can also compete against the most customizable PC headsets, thanks to powerful software.
                         The Inzone H5 offers a compromise between the wired H3, wireless Pulse 3D, and Sony's most premium H7 and H9 gaming headsets. PS5 gamers will find the Inzone H5 and its large plush earcups a pleasure to wear for long hours, with more subtle clamping force than experienced with the Pulse 3D. As far as styling, available in black or white, the H5 will fit in with any PlayStation gaming setup.
     Choosing the best headset to pair with a PS5 is no easy task. Following the steps on this guide makes it simple.                      With 40 mm drivers, the Inzone H5 is powerful enough that gamers won't find the need to max its volume. More importantly, the headset has a balanced enough soundscape for the most subtle 3D audio effects to come through clearly. Ironically, PC gamers have more control over the Inzone H5's 360 Spatial Audio, with PC and mobile software that scans a listener's earlobes for the most exact directional audio. PlayStation users will have to rely on the limited Tempest 3D audio settings, but even the default sound will add more dimensions to suspenseful and action-packed titles.
                         Gaming headset microphones are often used more on consoles since users are less likely to listen to music or watch movies. The boom microphone on the Inzone H5 flips up to mute and is not removable, but gamers will find it a dramatic improvement over the Pulse 3D. Sony also implemented AI algorithms on the microphone to isolate a speaker's voice more effectively.
                         PlayStation owners with unlimited budgets may gravitate toward the Inzone H9 with active noise cancelling. Regardless, considering its impressive battery life and convincing spatial audio, the Inzone H5 represents the best value among PS5 gaming headsets.
                         With how graphics have advanced in games, it's not surprising that multichannel audio has become commonplace. Surround sound and spatial audio make gaming more lifelike than possible with a stereo output. While assembling a multi-channel speaker system is time-consuming and costly, surround sound gaming headsets are a simple way to enhance a listening experience. To decide on the best surround sound gaming headset, focus on these factors:
                         With so many surround sound and 3D audio formats – like Dolby Atmos, DTS Headphone:X, and Sony's Tempest 3D audio – buyers should choose a headset appropriate for their PC or console. The Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 2 MAX solves platform compatibility issues with a single wireless USB dongle that works with PCs, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless takes a different approach, relying on Bluetooth connectivity and a DAC with multiple USB inputs. These headsets are flexible enough to support platform-specific surround sound and spatial audio technologies.
                         If a buyer is loyal to a single console, the Razer Kaira Pro features tight, dongle-free integration with the Xbox. Similarly, with the Sony Inzone H5, PlayStation gamers will have to make no compromises, since the headset maximizes the potential of Tempest 3D Audio.
                         For buyers looking for a studio-grade gaming headset, the Epos H3Pro Hybrid can please the fussiest listeners. Unlike most gaming headsets, the H3Pro Hybrid avoids boosting bass levels at the expense of overall sound quality. Microphone clarity is just as important to many gamers, and the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 utilizes AI algorithms to eliminate everything except a speaker's voice.
                         Surround sound formats like Dolby Atmos are popular in cinemas. A 7.1 channel configuration consists of a room full of speakers that send different effects to listeners. While many headsets support Dolby Atmos, 3D and spatial audio are also popular with these devices. Gamers will have the sensation of sounds moving around them that match a virtual gaming environment. For example, the HyperX Cloud Orbit S utilizes head tracking with Waves Nx 3D audio to make gamers think they are part of the action.
                         Wireless gaming headsets like the Logitech G Astro A50 X free gamers from wires, which can be a drag on gaming enjoyment. The G Astro A50 X showcases Dolby Atmos and can switch between consoles and PCs thanks to an innovative HDMI 2.1 base station. Even so, the wired HyperX Cloud Orbit S offers a variety of wired connectivity, including USB and analog audio, for the lowest latency performance possible.
                         Of course, budget and value are also two critical considerations for buyers of surround-sound gaming headsets. Among the many options, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 is an excellent mid-range pick for casual gamers looking to elevate gaming with top-notch spatial audio. On the other hand, the Logitech G432 allows budget gamers to experience 7.1 surround sound without a significant investment.
     Earbuds are becoming increasingly popular among gamers, and these are the best ones available right now.                     A good way to illustrate the difference between surround sound and spatial sound is that traditional stereo surround sound comes at the listener from distinct angles — from the left and the right, and from the front and the back. Spatial audio and virtual surround sound are sometimes used interchangeably, and both denote a more global approach to immersive sound, and can be heard in an entire 360-degree circle around the listener.
                         Dolby Atmos is a surround sound provider, in the form of a software that can be retroactively implemented into a headset after it's been purchased by the user. If the product packaging claims the headset is "Dolby Atmos compatible," that means that Dolby surround sound is possible on the headset, but not automatically available (heads up - whether specifically stated by the manufacturer or not, Dolby Atmos can provide virtual surround sound through any headset with a typical two-driver setup). The first step to implementing Dolby Atmos on a headset is by downloading the corresponding Dolby Atmos mobile app.
                         While gamers can enjoy titles with stereo speakers or headsets, surround sound immerses listeners in gaming environments. Also, particularly in FPS titles, surround sound or spatial audio can give competitive gamers an advantage by signaling the exact location of approaching enemies.
