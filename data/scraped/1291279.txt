 It's day two of Prime Day, and if you're smart you'll want to look at these phone deals before they're gone (get it?).  Jokes aside, Amazon has marked down phones from most major brands, like Samsung, Motorola, and Google, so if you've been looking for a good time to upgrade, this might just be it. (Apple loyalists, we regret to inform you that we've yet to see any stellar iPhone markdowns). We've rounded up some of the best deals on new and renewed phones, so you can snag a phone on the cheap without any weird contract stipulations (we're looking at you, every major cell phone carrier). Check out our top picks below:  The Samsung Galaxy S23+ is cool and high-functioning, there's no doubt. With Nightography mode, you can capture night images and vids in stunning resolution, and with the fastest mobile processor currently available for cell phones, rest assured that you'll never experience laggy functioning. 512GB of storage is more than enough to preserve all your docs, pics, and apps. This Galaxy model also has a trusty battery life that gives you more time to watch your favorite movies, scroll your preferred socials (hello Threads!), and chat with your friends. Best of all, this price beats yesterday's Prime Day pricing (which was a new record low already) by another $50. Google Pixel might not be your first choice for a new cell phone, but let us convince you that this particular Google Pixel 6a is worth the (arguably very low!) investment. The fact that it's unlocked gives you the flexibility to change carriers and choose your own data plan. Pixel is also equipped with some pretty cool camera features: like a 12-megapixel camera quality and tools such as Magic Eraser, Motion Mode, and Portrait Mode. The Google Tensor chip ensures speedy app launches, quick image loading, and an overall smooth experience with the phone. Thanks to just a few minutes of charging, the Google Pixel 6a receives hours' worth of juice in it. Why spend over $500 on a new phone when this deal is right in front of you for Prime Day 2023? The new Motorola razr+ is one of your best bets for a (more) affordable flip phone, and for Prime Day, it's at a brand new record low price. Unlike the Samsung Flip 4 (which is also on sale, btw), the razr+ has a larger outer screen at 3.6 inches. Considering that the dual screen thing is a huge part of the draw, this definitely isn't worth overlooking. Our friends at PCMag (also owned by Ziff Davis) say, "the Razr+ is the best flip phone you can get—unless you don't mind waiting to see what Samsung has up its sleeve with the Galaxy Z Flip 5 later this summer." But with this deal, why wait?
