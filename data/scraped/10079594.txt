 The “grandstanding politician” may qualify as the second-oldest profession behind, well, the oldest one. Say this much for the elder vocation though: At least there are services rendered. The politicians, meanwhile, rarely fail to disappoint. So did anyone else find it amusing that as the state celebrated UConn’s fifth national men’s basketball championship in 25 years, there wasn’t 10 seconds of dead air on pom pom waving state television without some kind of contribution from Messrs. Lamont, Blumenthal or Murphy? Part of it is expected. It’s the national championship. The bandwagon is big enough for everybody. It’s the “services rendered” part that must be addressed. Specifically: Now that the UConn basketball programs have delivered their 16th national title in the last 28 years — think about the enormity of that — why must there be another iteration of another plan to reconstruct the part-time home of the Huskies in the middle of our capital city? Has UConn basketball not done enough? Throw in Mike Cavanaugh and the resuscitated hockey program, too. That’s three legitimate contenders playing in the 48-year-old XL Center. Forty-eight years old. Eligible for social security soon, provided it doesn’t crumble first. Forty-eight and held together by bandages, chewing gum and duct tape all because our leadership has kicked the can down the road for years now. The can was last seen careening toward Boca. Ah, but perhaps there’s hope, as Charlie Brown was saying to Lucy just the other day. Maybe the momentum from another national championship will be enough for state political leadership to do more than wave pom poms and profess undying love for their Huskies. Maybe they’ll actually accomplish something this time. State legislators assassinated the original XL Center plan some years ago that called for a $250 million makeover. Three years ago, Mike Freimuth, who runs the Capital Region Development Authority, the quasi-public state agency that oversees the arena, presented a $100 million “lower bowl strategy” version designed to “shrink” the arena to around 11,000 seats for certain events, while also preserving the upper bowl capacity to reach 16,000 by using a special walling system. It was a good faith effort to assuage some financial burden. It should have been the launch point for productive discussion that would give downtown Hartford a shiny, new grande dame and a building that befits “the college basketball capital of the world.” Instead? More can kicking. Now, however, the CRDA has been asked to do it all over again. The Hartford Courant reported recently that the CRDA “this summer will determine the actual costs of a significant upgrade, now estimated at $107 million. … as CRDA negotiates with the arena’s operator (Los Angeles-based Oak View Group) for tens of millions of dollars in private investment for the project.” Essentially, CRDA, per the Courant, “will complete designs and seek bids for the different components of the renovation to see if actual costs are close to the $107 million estimate.” Freimuth wrote in an email to The Day last week, “We’re close. We got the design money at (last) Thursday’s Bond Commission and we can hopefully put the matter to bid. If it holds a budget at $107M then … ” Freimuth’s ellipsis may be the most significant part of the e-mail. This entire project has been an ellipsis. I’ve always commended Freimuth for his temperance. You want patient? Freimuth is Job on Lexapro. His $100 million plan, had it been acted upon in due time, might be done by now. Instead, we rise to $107 million with the vagaries of potential private funding threatening to halt progress. Sorry, politicos. Not acceptable. UConn is our de facto professional sports brand. Sixteen national championships in 28 years. Routinely brings people to downtown Hartford, 45,000 strong last week for the parade. Why must we continue to debate the bona fides of the most successful overall college basketball program in the country playing in the capital city? Lamont has said he supports public investment in the project, but believes there should be private funding to ease the burden on state taxpayers. I ask: Given the joy UConn has brought said taxpayers in the last 30 years, how many of them would actually care if this was entirely state funded? Freimuth said there are 80,000 UConn alumni within 30 minutes of XL, three UConn campuses in Hartford (Law, Business and Regional) and several downtown corporate sponsors supporting UConn. And we need to keep debating this? UConn's participation in playing games over the years at the XL Center has come mostly through unwritten rules. It keeps the downtown business owners happy and is politically astute. Good relations between UConn and lawmakers means favorable appropriations. This has largely been win-win. “Should the XL plan go forward there are two general impacts on UConn sports,” Freimuth said. “First, more revenue due to better seat/suite options, concessions and a change in the revenue sharing. Second, a reduction in games, with those booked being events connected with larger attendance games, as well as time of year when campus is closed. “Hockey is probably going to settle at 5-6 games now that the new (on campus) facility is operational and the basketball teams between 10 and 12. The net result is larger attendance games, better revenue streams and more games on campus, especially for those early season non conference games.” I get that a vocal minority of aggrieved taxpayers will shout damnation at the world over an entirely state-funded plan. But everybody else? The 80,000 alumni within shouting distance? The 45,000 at the parade? The 15,500 who will show up at every game next year to watch the defending national men’s champs and 11-time women’s champs with a healthy Paige Bueckers? Know what they’ll say? Build the damn thing. UConn’s success demands it. Because if the politicos are going to wave the pom poms on television and revel in victory, they need to do their jobs on the other end and give UConn a downtown arena befitting 16 national championships in 28 years.
