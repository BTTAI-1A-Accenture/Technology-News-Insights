This creative approach resonated with the audience and strategically enhanced Top of Mind (TOM) awareness about the DFCC Bank brand amongst the target group and the public. "Sinhala and Tamil New Year is the largest and most widely celebrated cultural festival in Sri Lanka and is centred around culture, tradition, and family values," explained Nilmini, "So, for Avurudu 2022, we wanted to do something different. Something that would excite and resonate. At the time, the country was recovering from the economic hit caused by the pandemic, which had a massive impact on the MSME sector and consumers. As a bank committed to supporting MSMEs and individuals, we crafted this video to showcase the Avurudu cultural values while strategically incorporating our values as a bank, using an innovative approach." The strategic placement of DFCC Bank's brand elements throughout the video ensured strong brand visibility, a key factor in making this campaign stand out. The video's vibrant music, dialogue and emotion added a fresh perspective and a layer of depth and engagement, enhancing the overall impact. A defining feature of the campaign was DFCC Bank's innovative advertising strategy.
