Cards with rotating bonus categories come with some of the highest credit card rewards rates available. Both Chase and Discover offer credit cards with 5% cash back on up to $1,500 in spending per quarter in bonus categories that change each quarter and 1% back on other purchases. To get the bonus cash back, you have to opt in, or "activate," the category each quarter. A Citi credit card with similar terms — the Citi Dividend Card — is no longer available to new applicants. It pays 5% in rotating bonus categories that you activate and 1% on other purchases. There's no quarterly spending limit, but the total cash amount of cash back you can earn in a year is capped at $300. Previous years are listed below the current categories, so you can see what's been offered in the past ... and what might be again? » MORE: Best cash-back credit cards and best 5% cash-back credit cards  Cards that earn bonus rewards in these categories include the Discover it® Cash Back and the Discover it® Student Cash Back.

Further, from Nov. 23 to Dec. 31 of that year, Amazon.com spending earned 10% cash back, rather than 5%.)  Q1: Macy's, home furniture stores. Q2: Home Depot, home and garden stores.
