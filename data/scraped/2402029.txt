“Principal Financial Group is a brand with remarkable sense of purpose and humanity, cultivated over its 144-year history,” shares Laurel Flatt, president of Dentsu Creative Chicago. “We’re eager to show off the breadth and depth of what the brand can offer customers. Through its deep expertise and history of customer care, Principal helps more people and businesses understand and access the financial products that can help lead to financial security - this is its powerful differentiator.” Globally, Principal serves over 60-million individuals and thousands of businesses and institutions working on behalf of investors through asset management, benefits and protection, and retirement and income solutions. Dentsu Creative replaces TBWA/Chiat/Day, which has been the brand’s creative agency partner since 2008. “We are incredibly proud of the work we did together with TBWA and so appreciative of the agency’s many years of dedication, collaborative spirit, and partnership, “said Jairo Garcia, assistant vice president of Global Brand Marketing and Media. The Creative AOR appointment comes after a rigorous, four-month review managed by Ark Advisors. Media planning and buying duties, managed by OMD, were not included in the scope of this review. “Dentsu Creative was the best fit for Principal based on its end-to-end creative and digital capabilities, strong cultural fit, and focus on delivering valuable business outcomes. This has been a rigorous process, and we are delighted to have Dentsu Creative as our new partner,” said Beth Wood, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of Principal Financial Group.  New work is targeted to launch in spring of 2024.
