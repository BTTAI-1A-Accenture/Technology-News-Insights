 The most intangible assets to an organization are your employees, not valuable equipment or your fancy office building. This is why it's vital to manage your employees effectively. The workforce today is turning out to be more complicated and diverse. Hence, enterprises need HR software to manage employees seamlessly. However, there is no single recruiting software that comes with all features your company needs. This is where application integration comes into the picture. Integrating HR software into other recruiting or workforce management tools can bring many benefits to the business. However, products integration is a complex process and needs careful planning. This article walks you through different ways to integrate other useful applications into your HR software. An Applicant Tracking System (ATS) is one of the most valuable integrations for your HRIS. As per Captera, 75% of recruiters and hiring professionals use an applicant tracking system. An ATS is a software application that effectively automates finding, tracking, managing, and onboarding candidates. The tool streamlines the whole recruitment process, including posting jobs, parsing resumes, screening candidates, scheduling interviews, sending mass emails, etc. Recruiting and employee onboarding is not easy, even if an HR tool has got your back. There will be endless tasks that need human effort and time. When you integrate ATS to your HRIS or HRMS tool, creating a system that covers all aspects of recruitment and employee onboarding becomes easy. 2. Workforce Management Software Employee management is the other challenging task next to recruiting. A Workforce Management software (WMS) helps you manage everything about employees from their database, timesheets, benefits to expenses, and legal compliance. A WMS ensures every task is run as efficiently and seamlessly as possible. Timesheets or record keeping is the most tiring job, and a good workforce management tool can help you effectively. Moreover, when you use a separate tool to keep records, you may create duplicates and waste huge time. Additionally, improper records result in severe errors that lead to penalties. A WMS allows you to generate timesheets automatically, prepare legal documents, generate accurate invoicing, and look after your cash flow. 3. Payroll Management Most enterprises using HR SaaS products use an external payroll system to handle payroll operations. Most enterprises using HR SaaS products use an external payroll system to handle payroll operations. Having two different tools for payroll and HR-related tasks can be daunting. Firstly, payroll is one of the most strenuous ongoing processes in a business. Handling it with a separate tool will only add an extra burden on your HR team, and hence errors may occur. Integrating your HR software into payroll management software will save your time, prevent costly mistakes and build an error-free payroll system. 4. HR Analytics Integration HR analytics helps companies track the entire recruitment process efficiently. An HR analytics software helps track, measure, analyze employee data and get deep insights into your hiring process. Having insights into candidate management helps you make better hiring decisions faster. Hence, integrate your HR SaaS product to HR analytics software as well as Workforce Analytics. Workforce analytics helps you understand how your business is performing. It helps you with comprehensive financial reports, open invoices and keeps you focused on your business goals. 5. Mass Mailing Tool Mass mailing tools are useful for recruiters to invite potential candidates to an open position. While running an email campaign is a hugely time-consuming task, a bulk mailing tool helps you save time by sending emails to a large group of people at one time; guiding them through the recruitment process, or sending mass rejections. Having a mass mailing tool integrated into your HR SaaS product makes your recruitment easier. Integrating external tools into your HR SaaS product makes the critical parts of employee management easy. Integrations boost efficiency, productivity, reduce errors and keep your business ahead. However, not all HR SaaS products are compatible with integrations. So, make sure you choose the HR tool that offers in-app integration or third-party integration.
