We will wait for it at GIIAS 2023 (in August). If anyone is interested, they can access the microsite. And there will be a booking fee of IDR 5 million (~RM 1,550). So, with that IDR 5 million, it will be considered a pre-order." Irwan also said that pre-orders before the launch day will have priority of delivery and receive additional value-added packages.   President Director of PT MMKSI, Atsushi Kurita also told Autofun Indonesia that the shape and design of the new SUV will not differ much between the concept and production models. Especially at the rear end; where itâs very similar to the production vehicle. Also read: Spied: Mitsubishi XFC spotted in Vietnam - X50 and HR-V rival to be launched in Aug 2023?  Atsushi declined to elaborate on the name of the production vehicle. However, given the XFC Concept previews a compact crossover model, itâs been touted as the all-new Mitsubishi ASX (or Outlander Sport, as itâs known in Indonesia).  Besides its new, macho design, the XFC Conceptâs production counterpart is claimed to offer spacious cabin space with good visibility as well as a minimalist dashboard layout with a Mercedes-Benz-like horizontal screens. Though there is no mention of what powers the XFC Concept, it is likely that it will be offered with a range of petrol and hybrid powertrains.   Mitsubishi also claims that selected variants four drive modes â Normal, Wet, Gravel, and Mud â hinting AWD powertrains are on the cards. Closer to home, the previous-generation ASX was among the first compact crossovers to hit the market in 2010. Although Mitsubishi had a head start, it would eventually lose out to the likes of the Honda HR-V, Toyota Corolla Cross, and the Subaru XV.

Perhaps this will change when the upcoming production-version of the XFC Concept breaks cover. Arvind Senior Writer Arvind can't remember a time when he didn't wheel around a HotWheels car.
