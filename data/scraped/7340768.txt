JACKSONVILLE, FL / ACCESSWIRE / August 14, 2023 / ParkerVision, Inc. (OTCQB:PRKR) ("ParkerVision" or the "Company"), a developer and marketer of technologies and products for wireless applications, today announced results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. First Half 2023 Summary and Recent Developments Jeffrey Parker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "ParkerVision currently has a dozen open cases in U.S. Federal Courts against eight companies to enforce our patent rights for the unauthorized use of our wireless technologies. We strongly believe the innovations covered by ParkerVision's patents have enabled more competitive and compelling wireless products, and we encourage those who have benefited from incorporating our technology into their products to obtain authorization to use our protected intellectual property through a license. As we learn of additional infringement, we expect to continue to expand the enforcement of our patent rights." Mr. Parker continued, "ParkerVision has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in R&D and marketing in its patented RF receiver and transmitter technologies to enable ultra-small semiconductor chips that deliver high-performance RF wireless communications for mobile telephone standards such as 3G, 4G, and 5G, WiFi® communications, Bluetooth®, satellite communications and other wireless applications." Financial Results About ParkerVision ParkerVision, Inc. invents, develops and licenses cutting-edge, proprietary radio-frequency (RF) technologies that enable wireless solution providers to make and sell advanced wireless communication products.
