   Login Register   The event tech landscape continues to evolve as the industry approaches a new year. From security and trust certification to a virtual event and webinar benchmarking report to the opening of award submissions, check out the latest happenings with Bizzabo, Notified and the Event Tech Awards. Bizzabo, the Event Experience Operating System (OS), has achieved Service Organization Control (SOC) 2® Type 2 compliance, which recognizes the company as a secure, trusted industry leader. The accomplishment demonstrates Bizzabo’s ongoing commitment to information security and signals that its comprehensive open platform is among the industry's most secure event management technology.  “SOC 2 compliance is a milestone validating Bizzabo as a trusted partner for our customers and their data assets,” said Boaz Katz, chief data officer and cofounder of Bizzabo. “Customers already depend on our platform for an unmatched event experience, and now they can be assured our Event Experience OS is highly secure as well.” The validation of Bizzabo’s event data security practices is a testament to its entire organization’s dedication to security and data management, according to Katz. “Maturing our information security posture is continuous, and we’re committed to maintaining these standards as we move forward,” he said. SOC 2® Type 2 compliance is an industry standard among third-party service organizations that deal with client data. Set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), successful fulfillment of these standards asserts that an organization’s internal systems and controls effectively meet audit standards continuously while ensuring the protection of existing and potential customers’ assets.  Bizzabo’s SOC 2 examinations were conducted by PwC during the audit period of Jan. 1 to June 30, 2022.  Event communications cloud provider Notified unveiled its 2022 Benchmark Report for Webinars and Virtual Events, which analyzed customer data from the company’s leading technology.
