The event was originally a once-a-year promotion that took place in April, but over the past couple of years it has morphed into a bi-annual event with one sale in the spring and another in the fall. Way Day was historically a 48-hour event, but for the second year in a row the retailer is extending it into a 72-hour affair. Way Day 2024 started Saturday, May 4 and will run through 11:59 p.m. PDT tonight. That means today is your last chance to shop the sale. If you miss it, you’ll have to wait until the fall to find similar savings. This year, Way Day is set to be a 72-hour event. While the sale used to last only 48 hours, the brand offered a surprise extension last spring that it’s bringing back for 2024. Despite the extension, we recommend shopping as early as possible since Wayfair’s most popular pieces tend to sell out early. Way Day will end tonight at 11:59 p.m. PST. Once it’s over, you’re not likely to see another sale of this size at Wayfair until the fall. No, Way Day isn’t a sitewide sale. But similar to Amazon’s Prime Day, you’ll find deals on just about every product category that Wayfair carries. So whether you’re looking for a media console or some throw pillows, it shouldn’t be hard to find what you need at a discount. Up until 2022, Way Day was an annual event. But for the past two years, Wayfair has hosted the sale twice a year, once in the spring and once in the fall.
