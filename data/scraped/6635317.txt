A relatively flat day on Wall Street did not translate to our Mobile and Alabama Stock Report as all but five stocks took a loss on Thursday. Mobile-based Computer Programs and Systems Inc. was one of those in the positive, picking up a modest .8%. It is a provider of health care solutions and services for community hospitals. Amazon was the big winner on the day, however, pulling up 4.3%. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
