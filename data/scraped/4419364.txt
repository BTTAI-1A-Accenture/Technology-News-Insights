 While many people were comfortable getting around without makeup during the pandemic, that may no longer be the case as mask restrictions gradually ease. Now that masks are no longer required on public transport, a commuter decided to save time by doing her makeup during her one-hour MRT train ride.  Despite receiving stares, the lady went ahead with her routine and emerged at her destination station with her makeup completely done. On Sunday (19 Feb), TikTok user @unbiden shared a video showing how she went about doing up her face on the MRT. First, she cleans her hands with disinfecting wipes before applying her primer.

She also offered a tip for those who are too embarrassed to do their makeup while commuting — be unbothered. If someone stares and judges you, stare back and smile.

She calls her contour and highlight stick a “life saver” as it only cost her S$12. Although she did not show the brand of the stick, it looks an awful lot like the Play 101 Contour Duo stick.

Some even said she was exhibiting “girlboss behaviour”.

It saves lots of prep time before heading out of the house and is also convenient for those who always have someplace to be. Though certainly uncommon, there is no reason to gawk at or judge someone doing their makeup on buses and trains — just let people do their makeup in peace, as long as they’re not hurting or bothering anyone.
