Thoughts From Head Coach Ritchie McKay “I’m incredibly impressed with Eastern Kentucky and A.W. (Hamilton) and his staff and their players. That’s a really, really good team and a really good program. To be able to advance, we earned it because they kept punching and kept coming. I was really pleased with our guys’ response. I say it all the time, but I think the crowd is worth five to seven points on a nightly basis when it’s like. That was a tremendous atmosphere, and Flames Nation should celebrate the assist they had in the win. That was a great college basketball atmosphere and a really good game.” Box Score Highlights Liberty Individuals: Darius McGhee 29 points, 8-9 FT, 6 rebounds, 4 assists; Colin Porter 25 points, 10-16 FG, 5-9 3FG, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals; Kyle Rode 9 points, 3-4 3FG Eastern Kentucky Individuals: Devontae Blanton 23 points, 9-20 FG, 9 rebounds; Tayshawn Comer 14 points, 6-10 FG, 4 assists, 3 rebounds, 2 steals; Cooper Robb 10 points, 4-8 FG Key Team Stats: Liberty finished the night shooting 44.4 percent (28-of-63) from the field.
