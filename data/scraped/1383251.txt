As the utilisation of AI continues to rise and the integration of various AI technologies in work environments experiences significant growth, we conducted a survey to explore employees’ perspectives on AI and its implications for their jobs. Our survey quizzed over 1,000 office workers in the UK, aiming to uncover their concerns, spending patterns, and examples of AI adoption within their workplace. From Chat GPT to spelling and grammar tools like Grammarly, AI seems to be everywhere. AI, short for Artificial Intelligence, refers to the exciting field of computer science that focuses on creating computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Although a great advancement for the modern workplace, concerns over the future of AI and its impact on jobs are still prevalent. UK office workers reveal their opinions on AI in latest research*. Topic of AI Dominating Office Conversation
It’s probably no surprise that 96.46% of respondents answered ‘yes’ when they were asked if they know what AI (artificial intelligence is)? Only 0.79% responded negatively, and answered ‘no’ whilst 2.76% shared that ‘I’ve heard of it but I’m not sure’. For those who answered ‘yes’ 69% were aged 18-34. Of those who answered ‘I’ve heard of it but I’m not sure’ 48% were aged 35+. It seems that the younger generation are the ones jumping on the AI bandwagon. While AI appears to dominate conversations around office spaces, the key question remains: Are employees actively incorporating AI into their work responsibilities and if so, how? More and More Using AI Applications
The survey asked respondents if they currently use AI in their business or workplace. 89% shared that they already use it, 5% shared that they don’t use it at all and an interesting 6% shared that they are looking to start incorporating it into their work. Here, the results showed a similar trend as above. Among the participants who claimed to be using AI at work, a whopping 71% were between the ages of 18 and 34. On the other hand, among those who admitted to not using AI, a significant 57% were aged 35 and above. Men Are Early Adopters of AI Technology
The survey looked at respondents who currently use AI in their business or workplace as well as their gender. A shocking 72% of ‘yes, we use AI in the workplace’ respondents were male, compared to those who answered ‘no’, 68% of which were women. It looks like men are the ones making the most of AI in the workplace. 65% of ‘we’re looking to start incorporating it’ were female, potentially trying to seek an AI budget or even permission. AI Still Receiving Mixed Reception Amongst Workers
When survey participants were asked about their opinions on the future of AI, the results showed a diverse range of perspectives. Around 36% expressed a belief in a positive future for AI but emphasised the need for caution. Another 32% showed enthusiasm and embraced AI, viewing its future positively. On the other hand, 18% held the view that AI would lead to job displacement, while a surprising 14% expressed concerns about the uncertain nature of AI and advocated for a lack of trust in its potential. Despite the widespread discussions and utilisation of AI, it is evident that a significant portion of the workforce still harbours apprehensions. Over Two-Thirds of UK Workers Believe AI Will Replace Some Jobs
When exploring opinions on the future of AI and its impact on job security, the survey asked respondents whether they are mindful of AI potentially replacing their own or others’ jobs in the future. Here’s what the survey found: 67% believe that AI may replace some jobs but not all. A huge 31%, one in three, think that AI will replace most jobs in the future. A small proportion of just 3% don’t think AI will replace anyone’s jobs. It is natural to feel apprehensive about significant technological advancements, much like when the internet was invented or any other major technological innovation. It’s important to note that while jobs may be replaced, new opportunities are continually emerging. In fact, we are already witnessing the emergence of roles such as “AI prompt engineer” and “Natural Language Processing Developer” as AI continues to evolve and take over the workplace.
