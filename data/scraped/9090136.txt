A slew of earthquakes shook up the Salton Sea region of Southern California within 24 hours over the weekend, with the seismic activity reaching up to 4.5 in magnitude.  The first swarm began at 12:08 p.m. Saturday in the US-Mexico border town of Herber, with nearly 50 tremors shaking the area until 5:12 a.m. Sunday, the US Geological Survey reported.  The Herber quakes reached up to 3.7 in magnitude and were felt by about 60 people.  The second swarm struck nearly 40 miles north, by the town of Niland, where more than 25 tremors then shook the southeast shore of the Salton Sea starting at 12.09 a.m. Sunday.  Those earthquakes lasted until 5:28 a.m. and reached a higher magnitude of 4.5, which was felt by about 30 people, UGS said.  In between the swarms of seismic activity, a 3.2-magnitude quake hit the eastern shore of the Salton Sea near Ocotillo Wells at 10:55 p.m. Saturday.  There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries after the earthquakes. The seismic activity comes just days after earthquakes rattled the Ocotillo Wells and El Centro areas, where there have been at least five recent earthquakes of a magnitude of 3 or higher, according to the UGS.  California and Nevada have seen an average of 234 earthquakes between magnitudes of 3 and 4 a year, according to the latest report from UGS seismologists.   Although earthquakes within that range of magnitude can be felt by people and cause minor damage, itâ€™s not entirely rare for residents to miss them or even sleep through them.
