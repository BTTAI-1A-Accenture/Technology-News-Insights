(14/07/23) 
			   SITA has been awarded a landmark deal from the Airports 
			  Authority of India to provide technology to 43 of Indiaâs biggest airports. Under the agreement, SITA will deploy its 
			  state-of-the-art, IATA-certified  solutions, including SITA 
			  Flex, CUPPS, SITA CUSS, and SITA Bag Manager.  The deal will see improvements at over 2,700 
			  passenger touchpoints, paving the way for the adoption of new-age 
			  solutions that will not only enhance airport operations but also 
			  improve the overall travel experience for passengers. Initially 
			  deployed across 43 airports, the technologies are scalable to an 
			  additional 40 airports over the next seven years. Over 500 million 
			  passengers are expected to be processed during that period. The rollout of new cloud technology will enable 
			  Indian airports to shift to common use passenger experiences where 
			  multiple airlines can leverage the same infrastructure, such as 
			  check in counters, self-service kiosks and boarding gates. The adoption of cloud solutions also brings new 
			  agility and flexibility to scale airport operations efficiently as 
			  passenger numbers grow. The cloud first approach enforces better 
			  security and offers airlines a platform to host new progressive 
			  technologies and move away from native applications. Centralized 
			  cloud hosting of all servers also means reduced on-premise 
			  infrastructure costs and results in centralized control, enabling 
			  proactive monitoring and control of services. âWeâre excited to partner with AAI on this large-scale deployment 
			  of leading passenger processing solutions,â said Sumesh Patel, 
			  President, Asia Pacific, SITA. âThe number of airports 
			  in India is expected to increase from 148 today to 220 by 2025. 
			  The new airports will bring closer together Indiaâs almost 50 
			  cities with populations exceeding one million people, creating 
			  substantial economic value in the long term. By connecting these 
			  cities better, air travel and transport will help unlock the full 
			  potential of Indiaâs economic growth too. Ensuring efficient and 
			  fluid operations and a seamless passenger experience at these 
			  airports will be critical to delivering on Indiaâs air transport 
			  industry opportunity.â AAI officers at the airport and headquarters now 
			  have access to online real time dashboards, replacing the monthly 
			  service availability reports that they used to refer to. The 
			  solution ensures they are better informed and know the 
			  availability of systems across all airports at every point in 
			  time, optimizing efficiency and promoting smoother operations. Latest 
			  exclusive video interviews: Future of Air Travel -
