Bollywood Shah Rukh Khan shut down a troll who tried to age-shame him.  DNA Web Team Updated : Aug 10, 2023, 06:54 PM IST | Edited by : Simran Singh Shah Rukh Khan isn't just the King of his fans, but he's also a pro in sarcasm, giving sassy replies to trolls in the most decent manner. On Thursday, Shah Rukh Khan released the new poster of his upcoming movie Jawan and later he initiated an Ask SRK session on Twitter. 






One of the netizens tried to age-shame the actor and said that he has crossed the age of being a Jawan (young), and he has grown old. The internet user wrote to SRK, "@iamsrk #AskSrk #ShahRukhKhan. Sir jawan hone ki ek umer hoti hai par aapki umer to bahut jada ho gai (Sir there is an age for being young, and you have grown old)." 
Here's the tweet

Shah Rukh Khan noticed his tweet and gave him a taste of his own medicine. The actor called him fool, and wrote, "Accha kiya yaad dila diya….ek aur yaad rakhna…bewakoof hone ki koi Umar nahi hoti….ha ha. #Jawan (It's good you remind me. Also, do remember, there is no age limit of being a fool as well)."

Another fan asked to abuse him so that he can get a reply from the actor. The fan wrote, "@iamsrk sir atleast gaali hee dedo but reply dedo." Khan noticed the tweet and responded to him with a line that he learnt from Jackie Shroff. He replied, "Teri baat ka baida maroon….ha ha. (learnt this lovely non-gaali from one and only Jackie Shroff!) happy? #Jawan."
