US automotive supplier BorgWarner and semiconductor manufacturer Onsemi are expanding their collaboration for silicon carbide (SiC), making the total agreement worth over $1 billion in lifetime value.  BorgWarner plans to integrate Onsemi’s EliteSiC 1200 V and 750 V power devices into its power modules for traction inverters. Inverters control electric drive motors and are part of power electronics. BorgWarner often claims its devices enhance the EV performance, for example, through better cooling, and is running a portfolio by now with production being scaled up gradually. From Onsemi’s perspective, the silicon carbide in semiconductors is increasing the efficiency of the inverters and drives, leading to said improved performance, faster charging speeds and greater range. Conversely, the inverters themselves can become smaller, and the corresponding cooling systems can also be made smaller due to the lower heat loss, further reducing energy requirements. Looking at the above benefits, it is no wonder that BorgWarner and Onsemi have been working together for a long time and intend to do so. By using the new SiCs, BorgWarner expects to once more benefit from increased power density and higher efficiency. Today’s statement mentions BorgWarner’s Viper modules to utilise Onsemi’s EliteSiC technology. Said family of silicon and SiC power modules comprises 400V and 800V inverters. BorgWarner launched the Viper line in February and set the start of production for the new inverter program for 2025, with peak annual volume nearing 400,000. For BorgWarner, the partner’s “continuous and strategic investment in ramping SiC manufacturing capacity across its end-to-end supply chain gives us confidence in our ability to support the increasing demand for our solutions, now and in the future,” said Stefan Demmerle, VP of BorgWarner and President of PowerDrive Systems. “With Onsemi’s chip-to-system level support and a track record of execution, we are able to provide industry-leading SiC-based solutions to BorgWarner at an accelerated pace to support its go-to-market requirements,” said Simon Keeton, Executive VP and general manager, Power Solutions Group, Onsemi. Onsemi also counts Volkswagen, BMW, Hyundai-Kia and Zeekr or the supplier Vitesco among its customers. borgwarner.com Your email address will not be published.
