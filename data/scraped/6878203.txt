The Human Services Technology Mental Health concentration prepares students for job opportunities in the mental health field. The curriculum enables students to understand culturally and emotionally handicapped, developmentally disabled or addicted clients through a variety of models and diagnoses. Classes are offered seated, hybrid and online. Some courses are not offered in the online format, so the degree cannot be accomplished completely online.
