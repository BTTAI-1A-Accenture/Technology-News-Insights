Things are heating up, so feel the fireworks and soak up the power of the full supermoon moon this July.

But first, let's break down the meaning of the Buck Moon. MORE: What is a 'Pink Moon'? Full moon rituals to blossom this spring The Buck Moon will arrive Monday, July 3, 2023, at 7:39 a.m. ET. The moon will appear full for the next few nights, according to NASA. This is also a supermoon, according to the Old Farmers' Almanac, and will appear bigger than other full moons this year. According to The Old Farmers' Almanac, which first began publishing names for full moons in the 1930s, the full moon in July was dubbed the Buck Moon by northeastern Native American tribes because the antlers of male deer, known as bucks, are in "full-growth mode at this time." Each year, a buck sheds its antlers to regrow larger and more impressive sets as they get older. The full moon in July is known by several other names related to the time of year, including Berry Moon, Salmon Moon and Thunder Moon. The zodiac sign for each full moon is determined by where the moon is positioned in the night sky relative to the different astrological signs. Each year the moon will shift, resulting in different characteristics surrounding the moon each year, according to Thomas. The Buck Moon this year falls in the sky as a full moon in Capricorn, a grounded zodiac sign that brings the whirlwind of summer back down to earth. As a sign, Capricorn rules hardwork, direct communication, loyalty and honesty. Your instincts are strong during this lunar cycle and you may feel the urge to build on a legacy or take charge in your domestic life, according to Thomas.

Due to this energy, many astrologers believe that a full moon is a great time to capture its power and use it toward manifesting your dreams. Thomas said that since this year's Buck Moon is in Capricorn -- an earth sign with a focus on professional success, career matters, public recognition and legacy -- you may want to try reconnecting with the Earth through herbs, crystals or spending time in nature.
