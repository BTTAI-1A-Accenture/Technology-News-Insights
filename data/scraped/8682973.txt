The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Safaricom PLC Peter Ndegwa has expressed confidence in his ability to steer the giant telco longer than some people would estimate. This comes on the back of speculation that the senior leadership of the telecommunications company is seeking to replace him, citing depressed growth under his tenure. In the Financial Year ended March 31, 2022, Safaricom saw its profits dip by 1.7 per cent to close the year with a net profit of Sh67.49 billion, down from Sh68.7 billion the previous year.





 Ndegwa attributed the weakened performance to Ethiopia entry, post-Covid-19 effects, a battered global economy and increased operating costs. Asked on Citizen Television on Thursday, January 26, whether he felt his stay at the helm of Safaricom was no longer tenable, owing to the slowed financial progress, Ndegwa said he is confident that he'll be allowed to lead the firm longer because of his "very successful three years".
