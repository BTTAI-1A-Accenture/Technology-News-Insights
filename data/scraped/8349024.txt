TEACHERS at Roku Primary School in Hiri-Koiari, Central, are teaching students in rundown classrooms that were built years ago, says a teacher. A teacher told The National during the World Environment Day celebrations by Puma Energy staff, Roku community and primary school students that even though Roku landowners owned the land which the refinery was on, their community was still unaware if there would be some help for new classroom projects for the school. The teacher said that the community was not sure of the process to ask for “new classrooms”, all they knew was that the local level government (LLG) president would have to talk with landowners and bring the matter to the district administration and Central government. Puma Energy had its crude oil refinery set up at the Roku beachfront area that carried its imported crude oil refinery at Roku. The energy company also had two of its deep sea offloading pipes set up metres from the Roku shoreline and it also bought crude oil from ExxonMobil. Attempts by The National to get a comment from Puma Energy’s country manager on the possibility of classroom projects and other initiatives, were unsuccessful.
