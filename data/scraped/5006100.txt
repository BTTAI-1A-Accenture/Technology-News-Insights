EPL In March 2022, just after half-time in Everton’s Premier League home match against Newcastle United, Louis McKechnie walked down a flight of steps at Goodison Park, climbed casually over a gate and made his way onto the pitch. Once there, and before anyone had the chance to stop him, he bound himself to the goalposts with a metal-enforced zip tie looped around his neck. The game was halted for 10 minutes as security personnel attempted to remove him. During this hiatus, McKechnie unzipped his jacket to reveal a bright orange T-shirt bearing the words ‘Just Stop Oil’. Fans who watched this all go on with a mixture of bemusement and amusement did not realise it at the time, but those three words have come to weigh heavily on British sport in the 16 months since. McKechnie was acting as part of a group which is demanding the UK government stop approving licences for new oil, coal and gas projects because of their role in the world’s climate crisis, and this was one of the first times they had disrupted football in their pursuit of publicity for their cause. Advertisement There were attempts to invade the pitch at other Premier League matches that spring, including Arsenal’s home game against Liverpool, while four months later several protestors ran onto the circuit during the British Grand Prix as drivers made their way back to the pits after the race was halted. But Just Stop Oil’s targeting of major sports events has reached new heights this summer, with a string of high-profile occasions disrupted by their actions. These disruptions have prompted fierce debate. Some observing the group’s activities have ensured a level of publicity that would have been beyond them with less intrusive tactics; others, however, claim they are self-defeating because they alienate the public from their cause.  Regardless, Just Stop Oil has no intention of halting the campaign. And with events such as the British Open golf championship — one of that sport’s four annual Major tournaments — starting in Hoylake, near Liverpool, on Thursday and a new Premier League season beginning on the second weekend in August, there is no shortage of potential targets. But who, exactly, are the group that have become Britain’s most divisive environmental campaigners? And what do they hope to achieve?  Just Stop Oil was formed in February last year by a man named Roger Hallam as an offshoot of two other environmental groups: Extinction Rebellion, which Hallam had also co-founded, and Insulate Britain, a group demanding the government fully funds and takes responsibility for the insulation of all social housing in the UK by 2025. Both attracted notoriety for their protests, mainly obstructing traffic by the simple method of groups of people sitting down in the road. This spirit of disruption has been fundamental to the tactics of Just Stop Oil, which describes itself as “a nonviolent civil resistance group demanding the UK government stop licensing all new oil, gas and coal projects”.   Advertisement It is underpinned, to a large degree, by the Climate Emergency Fund, a U.S. network set up by Aileen Getty, granddaughter of late oil tycoon J Paul Getty, and boasts a diverse membership, in age at least. McKechnie was a 21-year-old student when he tied himself to the goalpost that day at Everton, but the three protestors arrested for encroaching onto the courts of Wimbledon last week were all in their sixties. The group has organised slow marches along London’s roads – it was reported in May that the protests had cost the city’s police force £3.5million ($4.6m) – but it is sport that has been at the heart of their most eye-catching activities.  It says its reasons for targeting sporting events are not to solicit support but to raise awareness of the climate crisis and to prompt action to stop those new oil, coal and gas licences being issued. By taking action at events that are televised there is a ready-made audience, and, it says, it is partly because sport is “culturally relevant”. Just Stop Oil – whose members have been handed jail terms for their interventions – is by no means the only protest group to target sport. Earlier this month, members of Extinction Rebellion in Spain filled in the holes on golf courses as a protest against how much water the sport uses while the country grappled with a severe drought. In the United States, meanwhile, an activist from the group Direct Action Everywhere glued herself to the basketball court in April last year in Minnesota Timberwolves’ NBA match against the visiting Los Angeles Clippers – an animal-rights protest against the home team’s owner, Glen Taylor, whose other business interests include the poultry industry. Another member of the group invaded the field during the Los Angeles Rams’ NFL game with the San Francisco 49ers six months later.  Advertisement In Germany, the Last Generation (Letzte Generation) group, which has similarly radical tactics to Just Stop Oil, albeit slightly different aims, has also targeted sport. Last August, a Bundesliga game between Bayern Munich and Borussia Monchengladbach saw five supporters chain themselves to the goalposts in Bayern’s Allianz Arena. In April this year, people glued themselves to the track and support vehicles at Berlin’s Formula E electric car race. But no group has succeeded in causing such regular disruption as Just Stop Oil, which is targeting not only high-profile sports events but also – in the case of the Test at Lord’s and Wimbledon – key dates in Britain’s summer social calendar attracting a high-end clientele well beyond their diehard fans. The protests have been powerful, but also polarising. There has been criticism of both Just Stop Oil and the policing of them by members of Parliament – one, the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, advocated protestors being “dragged off the streets” – while the protests themselves can turn ugly. McKechnie had objects thrown at him during the Everton incident and later claimed to have received hundreds of death threats.  It seems a thankless pursuit, but the group has a simple explanation for its tactics.  “People will say ‘Take your protest to Parliament’ — which we do regularly — but a few months back 60,000 to 90,000 people gathered outside Parliament in one of the biggest environmental protests in history and it got basically no media coverage,” James Skeet, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson, tells The Athletic.  “That same week, a Just Stop Oil supporter jumped on a snooker table and it was on the front page of every major (British) newspaper. That’s why we focus on sport. It’s culturally relevant.  🎱 NEW OIL AND GAS WILL SNOOKER US🦺 At around 7:20pm, two Just Stop Oil supporters have disrupted the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, interrupting play. The pair proceeded to cover the tables in orange powder paint before being removed by… pic.twitter.com/xWJXjW82jf “People say we should go to oil companies themselves or go to government departments,” Skeet says, “but we and other groups have done precisely that. In April last year, we went to a number of key oil terminals and took it directly to them. We didn’t get as much media as would be preferable in that situation. Advertisement “The social science is clear: when you cause disruption you elicit a big, hostile response, which in turn elicits a lot of conversations.” Skeet references the radical tactics of the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S. and of the Suffragettes in securing voting power for women in the UK in the early 20th century. The latter had also targeted sport: in 1913, they failed in attempts to burn down the All England Club, the venue for the Wimbledon tennis tournament, and the grandstand of Crystal Palace’s then-stadium on the eve of the FA Cup final there, but did raze one of the stands of the ground Arsenal called home at that time.  “There’s a misunderstanding that we target these things because we hate them. That’s not the case,” Skeet says. “We want people to be able to play sports like cricket and tennis long into the future. We want these things to continue. But the trajectory we are on, given the situation (threatens that).” Sport, and football in particular, is at risk from climate change, with a 2020 report Playing Against The Clock: Global Sport, The Climate Emergency And The Case For Rapid Change, published by the Rapid Transition Alliance and Play The Game, noting that almost a quarter of the 92 clubs then in the Premier League and English Football League will suffer partial or total flooding of their stadiums in the next 30 years unless action is taken. The other issue for Just Stop Oil is the sponsorship of these sporting events. It points to the U.S. banking giant JP Morgan, which sponsored the Lord’s Test match and is one of the world’s major funders of the fossil fuels industry, and to UK bank Barclays’ sponsorship of Wimbledon — “one of the biggest fossil fuel financing banks in the world.” These arguments have found sympathy within sport itself.  One of Just Stop Oil’s biggest donors is Dale Vince, the green-minded entrepreneur who owns Forest Green Rovers, a club in the fourth tier of English football; Gary Lineker, the former England football captain and now the country’s highest-profile sports TV presenter, tweeted after the incident at Everton last year that the protest “got people talking”. Advertisement He doubled down on that stance when a guest on a discussion panel at Wimbledon this year. “I understand why people get so upset with it (the protests), particularly in sport,” Lineker said. “What is more important is probably our existence in the future rather than slight disruption of sporting events or other things.” Elsewhere, however, there are concerns, even within the environmental lobby.   Trevor Neilson, the Californian businessman who co-founded the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a primary funder of both Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, recently accused its protests of being “performative” and “not accomplishing anything”. It is a message echoed by Rupert Read, a former spokesperson and political strategist for Extinction Rebellion, who believes that seeking to persuade people to join their cause through more positive messaging has a greater effect than causing disruption. “I’m not going to try to dictate to other people where they put their attention, but there is a responsibility on all of us to think as carefully as we can about the effectiveness of our actions,” Read tells The Athletic.  He gives the example, in October 2019, of Extinction Rebellion protestors climbing on top of a London Underground train during the city’s rush hour and so halting services, pointing out that targeting public transport seemed “counterproductive”.  “It would be brilliant for more sports people in particular to speak out about this (the climate crisis), and not get too caught up in the question of ‘should we be supporting the disruption of events’ and instead to get more into the actual issue,” Read adds. The prospect of further disruptions to the sporting calendar is already making the various governing bodies wince as they contemplate increasing the number of security staff and, consequently, the costs of staging events. Wimbledon increased the level of searches of fans entering the All England Club grounds in the wake of last week’s disruption, and ‘sprinter stewards’ – staff tasked with chasing down protestors before they can reach the playing area – were employed at the next Test between England and Australia in Leeds. Advertisement But even organisers admit that stopping protests can be difficult, particularly at a venue such as the Royal Liverpool golf club in Hoylake, which offers potentially hundreds of opportunities for protestors to breach security cordons. The Daily Telegraph has reported that players and caddies have been instructed by the Royal & Ancient Club, which runs The Open every year, not to engage with protestors should any make their way onto the course.  Similar advice has been issued by the Premier League to footballers ahead of the new season, which begins on August 11, with the league also facilitating the sharing of information and data between its 20 clubs. In the meantime, the question of whether it is fair to cause havoc at events where fans have often paid eye-watering sums for tickets in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis will continue to be posed.  “In any normal circumstances, this sort of disruption would be entirely unacceptable,” says Skeet. “But what’s more disruptive: the sustained collapse of our food systems from crop failure or some confetti on a tennis court? The general secretary of the United Nations said this week that the climate crisis is out of control. The world’s average record temperature was exceeded three times last week, which is astonishing.  “I wish there was another way. Last week, Just Stop Oil was consistently headline news. Would we have had the same response by standing at the side of the road with some signs? I don’t think we would. “We’ll continue disrupting sports and cultural events until the British government makes that meaningful statement. “One surefire way of making sure we don’t come to disrupt an event is for those organisations to say we shouldn’t have any new oil and gas. If they come out and make those statements, we won’t touch them with a bargepole; it’s as simple as that.” That scenario still feels some way off. This year’s disrupted summer of sport might be just the start of things to come. (Top photo: Julian Finney/Getty Images) Get all-access to exclusive stories.
