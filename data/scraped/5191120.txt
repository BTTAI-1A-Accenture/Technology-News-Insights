Meanwhile, Google‚Äôs Cloud division has formed a partnership with homegrown gaming startup SuperGaming. As part of the tie-up, SuperGaming‚Äôs game engine, SuperPlatform, will be available for developers using Google Cloud to build, host and distribute their games. The move comes two years after an initial partnership between SuperGaming and Google in 2020, which saw the Pune-based firm move its on-cloud resources from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud. Developers will not be restricted to using only Google Cloud if they use SuperGaming‚Äôs resources, but Google‚Äôs service would be the ‚Äòpreferred‚Äô platform, the companies said in a joint statement. Financial details of the partnership were not disclosed. SuperGaming‚Äôs game engine, SuperPlatform, is presently used by Japanese developer, Namco, for the popular Pac-Man games on mobile devices. The startup, which raised $5.5 million in April last year, is also using its engine to build a homegrown battle royale title, Indus Royale. ¬† Milestone Alert!
