Last year, 10 NFL teams hired new head coaches. Following the Panthers, Broncos and Texans’ hires, this year’s vacancy count sits at two. Last year’s Saints and Buccaneers moves, however, showed these job openings can emerge at unexpected points. Listed below are the head coaching candidates that have been linked to each of the teams with vacancies, along with their current status. If other teams decide to make head coaching changes, theyâll be added to this list. Here is the current breakdown: Updated 2-14-23 (1:30pm CT) Please login to leave a reply. Log in Register How is Eric Bieniemy not anywhere in here still At least for Denver.  Weaken a division opponent by breaking up continuity with a coach who has been o coordinator for his an that entire careeer because they want Harbaugh or Payton  ..also everyone knows Andy Reid is the reason for the offenses success. And Mahomes! Helps to have a HoF QB. true but who knows how the #10 pick would’ve turned out in say Cleveland or Chicago Valid point. I’ve always thought highly of Reid. Fantastic run in Philly as well. yes it’s very clear he was ahead of his time when teams were still running I-Form , Reid had McNabb was throwing swings from the shotgun to Westbrook He was never going to be hired as a head coach by anyone. He has multiple domestic violence accusations from when he was a player. jimmyb  You are being polite about his record. He is a legend in Colorado Football and there is a great reason why he is banned from the University.
If it was me, I would be buried under the prison and not holding a position in any organization, let alone a candidate for a NFL Head Coach position. I don’t understand why Duce Staley doesn’t even get interview requests anymore. He did amazing things with the Eagles, they screwed him over, and he goes to Detroit and turns their run game into one of the leagues best, but not even a interview request. Eric Bienemy should have a HC position by now also. What a farce this league is when it comes to hiring black head coaches. i agree. I brought him up in the past when Tomlin was semi hot seated There is no hot seat in Pittsburgh. agreed but if the job were to become available it would attract similar names to one’s linked to AZ and Denver Because heâs a jerk. No one wants to interview Matt Patricia for their HC opening?  SMH Yes, the Barcelona Dragons have requested permission. All the 3rd round picks the 49ers are going to gain from coaches and players leaving are going to get dumped into the offensive line.  They are going to need a Center, Right Tackle and Right Guard.  Williams and Banks are the only starters under contract for next season. No Brian Flores…interesting. Not sure which opening is the most wanted? Texans cardinals because Arizona great place to live  rest are all bad gigs Charlotte, is easily one of the best places to live. Yes..because all head coaches look for, is a nice place to live.. You also commented that Tomlin was on a hot seat.. Câmon Man! semi-hot seated was the term used. and yes he was early on in the season after losing to Jets for the billionth unwarranted time. Start up the recycled NFL coaching carousel. These interview “lists” are a joke and purely window dressing. All one needs to do is look at 90% of the NFL head coaches photos that were hired in the past year or two to figure out who WON’T get HC jobs this off-season. Unfortunately! The Cardinals have turned into the Texans, i.e., a joke franchise. Just curious why interview âexpectedâ or Candidate mentioned is even being noted.   The reality is if the team actually requested or mentioned the coaching prospect, then mention it.   Harbaugh was never considered for Carolina.  There are articles on thatâ¦.  Ryanâs doesnât want anything to do with Denver or Houston, so why mention it?   Just keep things straight forward and donât speculate. It says updated 1/15/23 but there at least two guys still âto interviewâ prior to that, that we know have interviewed.  Also, you should remove candidates not in the running like Harbaugh-Panthers and Reich-Broncos. (not) updated 1/16 and we still see the same stupidity; c’mon Sam.  Plus, DeMeco Ryans is scheduled to interview with the Texans on Friday and it still shows unfounded opinion “not interested….”   How hard can it be to actually update a fairly short list? The annual NFL Head Coaching Search Tracker — The Raiders are not on the list and yet, I wish they were. Next year Arians? Recent story here about his itch to get back to coaching. Then a very recent story about Bowles staying on in TB. Is Bruce on the move? Broncos sign Sean Peyton
Colts get Jeff Saturday
Panthers get Kellen Moore
Texans get Brian Flores
Cardinals get Eagles defense coordinator Brian Flores is currently suing the Texans. Heâs not going there. Colts should realize they’re dumb and bring back Frank Reich
Kellen Moore great fit for Colts, so of course they haven’t interviewed him either. Texans will hire Demeco Ryans if no one else does  Denver gets either Payton or Evero, maybe Quinn Cards also option for Payton, if not promote Vance Joseph  Kafka gets stuck coaching Carolina Harbaugh not worth a comment. Let him keep manipulating the Michigan big wigs. Heâs a piece of work. Too bad when a great institution of learning is controlled by a egotistical mediocre football coach
Wow! Hardly mediocre.  Heâs won everywhere heâs coached.  However, â¦ agreement on the manipulation and cheap talk. Michigan would’ve fallen into irrelevance if not for Jim. Looks like Brian Flores is going to be adding a few more teams to his lawsuit when he doesnât get hired. hahaha Payton, Reich, and Quinn will be hired for three of these jobs. Of course, purely based on their being “most qualified.” roflmao
Players over 70%, yet coaches is 10-15% at best and there’s a reason why that has nothing to do with qualifications. smh trump 2024 Your IQ (or lack of it) is showing.
Please tell us more “all knowing.” i know of your being triggered 2 out of 3 ain’t bad. Shockingly low number of coaching openings this year. There were 10 last year and two of those were one and done.  Look for about 8 next year. As of Feb 7 at 3:22PM EST, the Cardinals are down to 2 of their candidates who haven’t been eliminated by them or lost to another team.  Neither is a candidate from a Super Bowl participant.  The Colts have 10 candidates still in contention.  It looks like the Cardinals will have to settle for whomever is left or start over and Colts are so indecisive, if they went into a restroom with two rolls of TP, they’d never come out. These articles are now sort of sounding like that old army joke about a group of soldiers in the field complaining they haven’t had a change of underwear in weeks – wherein the sergeant says Smith you change with Jones, Jackson you change with…
