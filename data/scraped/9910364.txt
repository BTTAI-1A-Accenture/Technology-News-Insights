All of the above created by using precise data analytics and enhancing people’s lives. That's the goal for the City of Coquitlam with its launch of a new two-year pilot project. The municipality is partnering with tech firm UrbanLogiq to help turn data into real-world solutions for safer streets, a thriving local economy, and more enjoyable public spaces. As part of Project Greenlight, a procurement platform that fast-tracks civic innovations, the collaboration is hoping to find tangible improvements in road safety, economic vibrancy and recreational enjoyment, a news release noted. The company, which was founded in 2016 with a mission to break down data silos in government, has developed a platform to help communities transform complex data into easy-to-understand visual formats that provide new, usable insights. "We are incredibly excited about partnering with the City of Coquitlam. Our core mission at UrbanLogiq has always been to unlock the potential of cities through data-driven insights," said UrbanLogiq CEO and co-founder Mark Masongsong in a statement. "This collaboration allows us to apply our advanced analytics to create real-world benefits. By teaming up with a forward-thinking city like Coquitlam, we're not just envisioning a better future; we're actively building it." Burnaby, Toronto and San Jose are some of the other municipalities working with UrbanLogiq.
