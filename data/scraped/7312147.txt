 Good Smile Company will rerelease two Hololive figures, as the Nendoroids for Minato Aqua and Natsuiro Matsuri will both be back in 2024. Both have a January 2024 release window in Japan. Matsuri will cost ¥6,600 from that storefront, but the restock of her is expected to appear in Q2 2024. She’s still in the US one for $65.99. Aqua will cost ¥6,100/$41.99. As she’s sold out in the US storefront, she’ll reappear in Q2 2024. Both originally appeared in December 2021. Both Aqua and Matsuri each come with three face plates.
