Pensacola, Florida, may have a lot of internet service providers to choose from, but a few stand out from the rest. You'll find satellite, fiber, cable and 5G fixed wireless, but AT&T's fiber connectivity beats them all. A broadband connection is a necessity these days, and there are a ton of ISPs currently on the market, making it tough to decide exactly what you need in your home. In Pensacola alone, there are eight solid ISPs to choose from, but you may find even more small providers that serve limited areas of the city.  There are a lot of aspects to weigh with each ISP, including the type of connectivity, the monthly price, internet speeds and hidden fees. When we say hidden, we mean additional monthly equipment charges, sign-up fees and price hikes. These can take what looks like a good deal and turn it into a monthly headache. Whether you're just moving to Pensacola or looking to change up your current ISP, here's what you need to know about available options. Pensacola has cable, fiber, fixed wireless and satellite options for internet service. Ahead, you'll find the top three ISPs with the best availability and package options.

Your particular internet service options -- including prices and speeds -- depend on your address and may differ from those detailed here. Pensacola has several ISPs available for customers, whether you're looking for fiber or cable, satellite or fixed wireless. Prices run the gamut, as do the internet speeds.  Most ISPs in Pensacola offer plans starting at just $50 per month. While the price ranges jump up quite a bit from there, some going upwards of $200 per month, many stay in the $50 to $100 range. A bundled internet plan may be the cheapest alternative for select Verizon or T-Mobile cellphone customers. As we said, most ISPs start at $50 per month, though that doesn't mean you're getting the same value across the board. Of those $50 plans, Verizon 5G Home and Spectrum offer the best value at cost per Mbps.  Several internet providers offer plans of 940Mbps or more, specifically when looking at AT&T. This ISP alone offers three high-speed fiber plans for customers. EarthLink, Verizon, Cox Communications and Spectrum all also offer high-speed plans. Below you'll find the fastest internet plans, along with what they'll cost each month. Of these, EarthLink and AT&T both offer multigigabit plans.   Pensacola's ISPs are wide-ranging, with plenty of options to choose from. If you're on a budget, you can still find great fiber options, as well as cable and fixed wireless with decent speeds and reliable connectivity. Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it’s impractical to personally test every ISP in a given city. So what’s our approach? We start by researching the pricing, availability and speed information drawing on our own historical ISP data, the provider sites and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. But it doesn’t end there. We go to the FCC’s website to check our data and ensure we’re considering every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. To evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service, we look at sources including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of the time of publication.  Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:  While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to “yes” on all three are the ones we recommend.  To explore our process in more depth, visit our How We Test ISPs page.
