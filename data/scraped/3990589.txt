Auburn baseball has had to play catch up all season long, but could not get over the hump in their first SEC series of the season. The Auburn Tigers faced the No. 6 Arkansas Razorbacks on the road at a challenging venue in Baum-Walker Stadium in Fayetteville. The Razorbacks were up for the challenge and outscored the Tigers, 21-5 on their way to a series sweep to open SEC play. Auburn had a great start to the weekend by jumping out to a 2-0 lead behind a solo home run by Kason Howell and a sacrifice fly by Caden Green. The Razorbacks stormed back in the bottom of the 5th inning by scoring five runs, most of which came off the bat of Brady Slavens, who hit a three-run blast to give Arkansas the lead. Arkansas took control of Saturday and Sunday’s game by not allowing Auburn to get a lead in either game. The first series is in the dust, and now Auburn begins a new week with four opportunities to right the ship with a midweek game against South Alabama, and a weekend series at Plainsman Park against Georgia. Here’s a breakdown of this weekend’s series loss at Arkansas.
