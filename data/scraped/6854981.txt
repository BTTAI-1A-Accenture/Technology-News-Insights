Kellogg named Eric Firer its new chief information officer for North America, effective June 19.  Firer takes over from Bill Rex, who will move to take up the role of CIO at WK Kellogg Co.  Firer joins Kellogg from Barcardi Ltd, where he held the role of CIO North America and Latin America, having previously served for six years in a variety of roles at Estee Lauder.   âFirer is a forward thinker with 22 years of IT leadership experience in the consumer packaged goods space and a proven track record of successful leadership, strategy planning, and execution,â a Kellogg spokesperson told CGT.   Firer confirmed the news in a LinkedIn post this week, sharing excitement at the "amazing milestone."  Last summer, the company had rolled out plans to split into three separate businesses â Global Snacking Co., North America Cereal Co., and Plant Co. â each with its own set of strategic priorities and financial targets.

At the time of the business restructuring, Kellogg also made a series of leadership changes, including Bill Rex as chief information officer of North America Cereal Co., Norma Barnes-Euresti as chief legal officer, Mike Christensen as chief human resources officer, Stacy Flathau as chief corporate affairs officer, and Sarah Ludmer as chief wellbeing and ESG officer.  Plans changed, however, in March 2023, when the company revealed it would instead separate its North American cereal business, resulting in two independent public companies: Kellanova, focused on snacks, and a North American cereal business, WK Kellogg Co. Both divisions continue to share the Kellogg branding on product packaging, the company said in a statement, but the move was intended to allow the businesses to âfocus on their distinct strategic priorities, execute with increased agility and operational flexibility, realize improved outlooks for profitable growth, and shape distinctive corporate cultures.â
