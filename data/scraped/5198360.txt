The Quantum-Nano Fabrication and Characterization Facility (QNFCF) is pleased to offer user training and support for mechanical sample preparation for transmission electron microscopy analysis. This service is available to anyone accessing our new JEOL F200 TEM system and is intended to complement existing sample preparation capabilities of the Zeiss FIB/SEM. The University of British Columbia is looking for a facility manager for their new Biodevice Foundry core facility. The University of Calgary is recruiting for a Cleanroom Technical Specialist to work in their new qLab cleanroom facility.   


 



 The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the Office of Indigenous Relations.
