Columbus' dining scene just got more bragging rights. Avishar Barua, the talented chef behind Joya's Cafe and Agni in Columbus, appeared on the Food Network show "Beat Bobby Flay" Thursday night in a kati roll challenge, an Indian street food dish. The show, currently in its 33rd season, features two skilled contestant chefs who compete head-to-head for the opportunity to challenge the famed Iron Chef Bobby Flay. Barua, entering the showdown with a cartwheel, competed against New York-based sous chef Romain Paumier. A blind taste test determined Barua the winner of the challenge, who then proceeded to the final round for a chance to take down Flay himself. Barua did just that. Need a break?

Barua opened Joya's late last summer at 657 High St. in Old Worthington. The Bengali American cafe, named after Barua's mom, serves a varied and frequently rotating menu, currently featuring items like Joya's breakfast sandwich, the crispy chicken Manchurian sandwich, and a kati roll. Vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free versions are also available. Beverages include tea, coffee, lattes and more. Barua opened Agni, a live-fire, fine-dining restaurant named for the Hindu god of fire, at 716 S. High St. in the Brewery District in March. The restaurant features an evolving five-course tasting menu inspired by Barua and his team's cultural backgrounds, including the Bengali shrimp taco, dry-aged Rohan duck and caramelized chai pudding. The restaurant also offers vegetarian and gluten-free options, wine, draft beer and cocktails. Its bar is available for walk-in seating, with a limited number of reservations available. tmoorman@dispatch.com @taijuannichole
