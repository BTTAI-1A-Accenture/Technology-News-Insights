Some of our favorite running gear, from shoes to tech to apparel, is going for a major discount today—read on to see our latest finds in the hunt for the biggest Post-Prime Big Deal Days sales.  More Post-Prime Big Deal Days Deals: As big brands make way for new versions of their best shoes, chances are they’ll take a chunk of money off the price of some of their older models. Sure enough, following Prime Big Deal Days, we've found a handful of great deals for everyone who doesn’t mind a year-old shoe. Lauded by our testers as a high-mileage shoe worth setting as your default on Strava, the Triumph is a daily trainer built to keep its bounce for the duration of your longest jaunts. This most current iteration has the most compliant sole foam yet, allowing Saucony to build the shoe up with more drop for extra heel-strike support. The foam wears a little quicker than on other trainers, but you can rest easy knowing this shoe will remain comfortable into its final miles. Built with considerable cushion as well as a sturdy rock plate, the Cascadia offers a comfortable balance between ruggedness and foot-friendliness. Deep lugs jut from the outsole to keep you in contact with ground control regardless of the terrain, and supports in the midsole and upper help you adapt to whatever the trail throws at you next. Shin splints, begone! If you're looking for the shoe that best supports an overpronating stride, we wager you'll find it in the Gel-Kayano. Built with ample cushioning at the foundation, this shoe perfectly guides your foot towards a stabler contact with the ground without breaking your natural rhythm. The Ghost line is one of our all-time favorites, consistently ranking among our top-tested running shoes. It's a perfect daily trainer that caters to beginners and seasoned runners alike with its well-rounded cushioning and springiness, and the Prime Day price tag for this model from last year is one of the most irresistible deals we've come across so far. From watches to bags to earbuds, we runners carry plenty of gear, especially on our longer adventures. These deals can take the edge off getting all your necessities sorted, perhaps just in time for a fall race or two. A high-quality treadmill for your home gym can be a serious investment, but it's one that pays plentiful dividends over time—especially if you can save a chunk of change on one.  The T22 offers an experience that will leave you with no outstanding needs or wants, coming standard with a max incline of 15%, safe and easy speed tuning, and a 10-inch display capable of connecting to most major streaming services. Looking to combine form and function in a running watch you can wear all day? Following in the footsteps of other lifestyle smartwatches like the Apple Watch, Garmin's Venu 2 packs loads of activity-tracking functionality into a sleeker profile made for the fanciest of occasions. Hooked earbuds might not be for everyone, but runners who like the added security should take a look at this deal on a Skullcandy wireless option.  While simplistic in appearance, these earbuds are perfectly moldable to the backside of your ears, and they can last up to 6 hours without needing a recharge in their case. They're also 61% off right now, making this a truly sweet deal. When your legs are stiff on a rest day, there isn't much that feels better than a sturdy foam roller between you and the ground—and for the deepest knots in your thighs and calves, this compact vibrating massage ball does the trick like nothing else. It provides more targeted relief than a standard cylindrical foam roller, and while it's initially a more intense experience, you can adjust the vibration speed to settle into the perfect rhythm for your recovery. Winter is coming, and with it, we’ll see some opportunities to stock up on base layers. In the meantime, too, you can snag some summer gear for next year’s base miles. Rich with features often reserved for pricier shorts, this pair from New Balance is made with a stretchy, breathable polyester for a solid balance of mobility and durability.  A mid-rise waistband helps keep the liner in place with ease, and the shorts come with a rear pocket that's positioned in the perfect spot to keep your phone, keys, or whatever else you carry from bouncing around too much. While it might not be the time of year to consider layering, the Prime Big Day Deals event is still a great opportunity to make sure you're stocked up for the winter months. You can sport this comfy zip-up from Under Armour as both an outer layer for a tee and a base layer under a jacket, making it a viable three-season garment that'll give you plenty of use. With a size range of XS-XXXL, these budget-friendly compression sleeves from Run Forever are designed to fit every figure flawlessly. They provide a healthy squeeze with 20-25 mmHg of graduated compression, and a stay-up cuff holds the sleeve securely over your calves. They also come in a ton of colors, giving you ample opportunity to match up your gear (or add a splash of something new). When the miles add up, the quality of your shorts begins to matter more and more, and this pair from Adidas has you covered with a built-in mesh liner and an overall fit that's loose enough to give you some room without feeling baggy.
