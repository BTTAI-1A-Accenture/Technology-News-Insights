 Task management giant monday.com offers one of the most scalable and intuitive automated workflow solutions around. It’s a team collaboration tool that can help you track your own tasks, as well as team tasks, depending on the plan you choose. All plans include the popular Kanban view, but paid plans get access to timeline, calendar and map views. Pricing:There’s a forever-free plan that gives you access to more than 200 templates for boards to help with lead capture, campaign planning and project management, to name a few. You’re limited to 500 MB of file storage, but you can create an unlimited number of documents. You only get one board per dashboard, but that should be enough for a freelancer or a very small team. The only confusing thing is that monday.com’s chart shows the free plan is available for two seats, while in another area on the site it shows up to five seats. Alternatively, you could choose from four different monday.com paid plans, starting at $33 CAD per month (paid on an annual basis) for three seats. The Basic plan ups storage to 5 GB, gets you priority support and unlocks viewer-only access. Upgrade to the Standard or Pro plan to get 20 GB or 100 GB of storage, respectively. It’s at these levels that monday.com allows integrations and automations, but limits how many actions your team can use (an action is a trigger followed by an action; “if this, then that”). *Pricing is billed annually; three-seat minimum ($11 CAD per additional seat per month) Learn more: Read our full monday.com review. Who should use it: Whether you’re a solopreneur or an enterprise, monday.com is an easy-to-use task management tool for any size team that needs to track any business-related tasks.

 Airtable is likely so easy to use because it’s similar to spreadsheets you’ve probably used before, such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. Airtable is far more flexible and powerful though, and it offers an intuitive interface designer (with drag-and-drop elements) that creates a more visual representation of tasks and projects. This task management software lets you essentially build custom project apps for your team with images, graphs, tasks and charts that you can assign to specific team members. Team members can comment back and forth on each interactive app for effective internal communication. Pricing:Although Airtable is one of the pricier options on this list—$20 USD ($27.20 CAD) to $45 USD ($61.20 CAD) per user, per month (if billed annually)—it offers a feature-packed forever-free version. The free version lets you create an unlimited number of databases, but it limits you to five users on one plan. The other limitations are in the number of records per base and per table (1,000 for each). You can add attachments, including images and videos, but only up to 1 GB worth. And you won’t get the Gantt chart or timeline views on the free plan. Airtable does allow you to integrate other software, including Salesforce, Outlook and Hootsuite, but you can only perform 100 automations per month at this level. If you upgrade to a paid plan, you’ll increase your storage to 10 GB on the Teamplan and 100 GB on the Business plan. You’ll also get more automations per month (25,000 for Team users, 100,000 for Business users) and more customization options. You’ll also be able to invite external users to view an Airtable project via a shareable link, though guests can’t edit, mark up anything or communicate through the program. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:Airtable is best used by creative and collaborative teams looking for a more visual task management solution that’s still easy to use.

 There’s a lot to like about ClickUp; it has almost any feature you could possibly want from task management software and it’s affordable. It has one of the most generous forever-free plans that doesn’t limit your users. If you decide you need more features or fewer limitations, you can upgrade to a paid plan, which starts at $7 USD ($9.52 CAD) per seat, per month (paid annually). Pricing:The free ClickUp plan does limit you to five spaces,100 lists per space and 100 MB of file storage, so it can work for a single person or a small team. You’ll also be able to use real-time chat in the app and you can create up to 100 custom fields, which are both features helpful for task management. ClickUp’s standard views are list, board and calendar; Gantt, timeline and workload views are limited to 100 uses. The only downside to “uses” is that once you go through them, there’s no reset and you’ll have to upgrade to a paid plan to keep using some features. Paid plans range from $7 USD ($9.52 CAD) to $12 USD ($16.31 CAD) per user, per month (paid annually) and most limitations are removed at this point. You’ll get unlimited spaces, storage, views and subtasks. Subtasks are smaller tasks nested under a larger task, which offers more organization than many of the best task management software. There are so many features ClickUp offers that it’s not possible to go over them all in this mini review. With that said, part of the downfall of ClickUp is that it can be overwhelming for a new user. It’s great to have so many tools and features and customization options, but it can be overwhelming, even if ClickUp itself is easy to use. Learn more: Read our full ClickUp review. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:ClickUp’s free and low-priced plans are great for managing your own work, but it’s a better task management tool for midsize businesses that need a budget-friendly task management tool.

 Todoist is one of the easiest task management programs to start using. It keeps the interface clean and simple, so it’s intuitive for any level of user. Create a list of tasks in projects and assign them to other users—you can even invite nonusers to view and collaborate on your projects. The views are limited to list and calendar, but you can get Gantt chart views with an integration. Pricing:The free plan of this task management software is generous with the features allowed (due dates, labels, integrations, templates and calendar sync, to name a few), but it’s limiting in how many ongoing projects you can have, how long activity history lives (one week) and the size of file uploads (5 MB). The slight loophole with the limited project is that the limit doesn’t apply to archived projects, so if you work quickly on small projects, you could make Todoist’s free plan work for you. Want your team to work faster? Todoist includes a productivity tool with gamification to inspire workers to improve or increase productivity by awarding Karma points. Paid plans loosen restrictions, so you can have up to 300 projects going at once and up to 100 MB file uploads. You’ll also unlock reminders, so you can send out notifications to ensure collaborators stay on task. Todoist also offers automatic backups for paid users and member roles. Being able to set user permissions makes it possible to invite clients to only view projects applicable to them and not edit anything. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:List-makers will love Todoist—its simple interface is easy to learn and use. Small teams that need simple task management and prefer list or Kanban-style views would likely do well with Todoist. Free; $5.99 USD ($8.14 CAD) monthly per user*

 Technically, any of the best task management software can be used to manage teams remotely, but Teamwork offers tools that specifically cater to remote teams. For example, there’s native time tracking on all plans—even the free one—so you can be sure all your billable hours are right where you need them in your task management app. There’s also real-time collaboration in task cards for multiple users. Pricing:The free plan is available for up to five users, but it’s a bit limiting. You can create up to two projects with tasks and subtasks, but you only get up to 100 MB of storage. Teamwork only allows five integrations, which you can use to create automations. You can’t add clients. You can set two custom fields.l. Paid plans are reasonable at $5.99 USD ($8.14 CAD) to $19.99 USD ($27.18 CAD) per person, per month, and there’s a three-user minimum, which means you’re looking at just a little less than $25 CAD per month at minimum (paid annually upfront). Even the entry-level paid plan has significant limitations, including no ability to track change history and no project-level tags. *Pricing is billed annually. Who should use it:One of the best reasons to use a free or paid plan from Teamwork is the time-tracking feature. You’ll be able to calculate billable and non-billable hours for each user, which can help with future quotes (and for billing clients). Free; $10.99 USD ($14.94 CAD) monthly per user*

 Asana is one of the best task management software options available and it’s a popular option for enterprises. Even small teams can make use of Asana’s free plan with its many unlimited features. For example, there are no limits on projects, tasks or storage for your account. All files are limited to 100 MB each, though. You can even integrate more than 100 third-party apps to your Asana account on any plan. Asana doesn’t give you access to all possible views on the free plan, such as the timeline view, which is similar to a Gantt chart. Pricing:Paid plans start at $10.99 USD ($14.94 CAD) per user, per month (paid annually), which is a bit expensive compared to other leading platforms, but there’s no user minimum. The benefits of a paid plan include access to unlimited dashboards, collaboration with an unlimited number of guests (or clients) and a workflow builder, so you can create automated and recurring workflows. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:Asana’s workflow builder makes it easy for anyone to manage a large team that requires task management. $15 USD ($20.40 CAD) per user, per month

 There are a lot of things to like about Basecamp, but perhaps the best feature is the pricing structure. You can use Basecamp as a freelancer for $15 USD ($20.40 CAD)and tolerate the minor limitations, or upgrade to $299 USD ($406.60 CAD) per month for zero restrictions. As far as features go, Basecamp allows you to create unlimited projects, to-do lists, message boards, direct messages, group chats, synced schedules and file storage. There are a few automations, such as check-in questions and project templates, which save a lot of time for managers. There are three views available: card, list and Basecamp’s own hill chart, which is a bit of a competitor of a Gantt chart. Client access is a big feature in Basecamp. You control what clients can see and you can add labels to content or messages for internal users to let them know clients can see what’s there. Plus, clients can give feedback in the app, so you can keep approvals, revisions and the like in one central location. And there’s never any charge for client access. Pricing:There are a lot of things to like about Basecamp, but perhaps the best feature is the pricing structure for the Pro Unlimited plan. Pay $299 USD ($406.60 CAD) per month with no per-user charge. You get access to all the general task management software features that Basecamp offers, plus an increase in storage to 5 TB and 24/7/365 priority support. Unfortunately, there’s no free plan from Basecamp anymore. You can try it for free, but freelancers and small teams will need to pay $15 USD ($20.40 CAD) per user, per month after the trial. This plan gives you up to 500 GB of storage per month, but there’s no limit on the features. Who should use it:Especially for large teams, Basecamp’s fee-free pricing is attractive—you’ll never pay a per-seat cost and you’ll get every feature and no limits on projects, users or clients.

 Wrike serves a variety of sizes of businesses with its five different plans, from Free to Pinnacle. If you have the budget for it, the Pinnacle plan gives you the ability to create a custom solution with advanced resource planning features for specific teams in your company. Creative, marketing, product management and IT teams have different task management needs, so you can get the right templates, automations and communication tools and make the best task management software that’s right for you. Pricing:The plans are generous with features, storage space and users—the free plan allows for unlimited users and 2 GB of storage per account—but for specific features, you’ll have to upgrade to a high-tier plan. If you want Gantt charts, you’ll need at least the Team plan, which costs $9.80 USD ($13.33 CAD) per user, per month, and has a two-user minimum. The good news is you can opt for month-to-month, which helps if you don’t have the funds to pay upfront. Business, Enterprise and Pinnacle plans require you to pay annually, and those plans start at $24.80 USD ($33.73 CAD) per user, per month, which may be too rich for some small business budgets. It’s at these levels that you unlock the various custom features, such as custom fields, workflows and item types. You also get real-time reports, workload charts and you can set user permissions. Wrike allows guest access and approvals in the Business plan and up, along with file proofing. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:Wrike is best suited for larger companies with specific project, task and collaboration management needs. The customized solutions for departments are pricey but could be just what you need for the right amount of organization and automation. Free; $5 USD ($6.80 CAD) monthly per user*

 Trello is one of the simplest task management tools around. It’s easy to learn and use, whether you have experience or not, which is why we consider it one of the best task management software available. It relies heavily on the Kanban-style board with drag-and-drop cards, making it accessible to anyone. Aside from the simple task management features and project creation, it has a visual interface, so it’s easy to see where projects are in the process. You can create lists full of cards and name those lists whatever you want, such as “in progress,” “needs approval” and “done.” Leave comments on cards, add files and create labels to make it easy to search your projects to find what you need. Pricing:The free plan is generous—there are no limits on users or cards for your account. You will be limited to ten boards and 10 MB per file upload. Plus, you’ll only get 250 Workspace command runs each month. Workspace command runs are Trello’s version of automations. If you need more, you have to upgrade to a paid plan, which starts at $5 USD ($6.80 CAD) per seat, per month (paid annually). On the low-tier plan, you get 1,000 automations per month across your account. It’s at this plan level you can invite guests to a single board, which is helpful for collaboration or client feedback. Your storage is increased to 250 MB per file. For views other than the visual Kanban board, you need to upgrade to the Premium plan, which includes calendar, timeline, table, dashboard and map views. All plans can set up integrations (Trello calls them Power-Ups) with more than 200 third-party apps, including Slack, Dropbox, Google Drive and Hootsuite. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:New users of project or task management software will appreciate how easy it is to learn Trello. Plus, its generous free plan makes it an ideal starting point for new small businesses. Free; $9 CAD monthly per user*

 Smartsheet offers a handful of views for all users, including Gantt, grid, card and calendar views. All plans include unlimited sheets and viewers, making it easy to create multiple projects and share them with users on your account. Smartsheet also gives every account automations for workflows but limits the low-priced plans to 250 automations per month. Pricing:Plans start at $9 CAD per user, per month (paid annually). The low-priced plan (Pro) maxes out at 10 users, at which point you’ll have to upgrade to the Business plan, which costs $33 CAD per user, per month (paid annually and has a three-user minimum). Client and collaborator access is limited to Business and Enterprise plans, and you can do so in two different ways: invite them as editors or publish a sheet, report or dashboard as a view-only document. *Pricing is billed annually Who should use it:Smartsheet offers similar features to other task management software, but it’s best used by those who prefer spreadsheets for projects and tasks. It’s like a more powerful, upgraded version of Microsoft Excel. 
 At its core, task management software is a program designed to help with assigning, tracking and organizing tasks as part of a larger project. Typically, task management software also includes reporting tools, so you can analyze the life cycles of tasks to help you improve productivity. Most project management software includes tasks and some include subtasks, which help you break a more extensive project into smaller pieces of work. Most task management software is cloud-based, which makes it easy for all users to access projects, tasks and data from anywhere. With real-time updates, managers can quickly assess who on their team can take on tasks and see when they’re completed, and employees can see their task lists from their personal dashboards. Task management software includes tools that help with managing tasks from start to finish. You’ll usually find time-tracking features, tagging and filtering features and commenting features. All of these features lend to better efficiency, communication and organization of work. As tasks are completed, data is stored and used in reports to help managers see where improvements can be made in time or resource management. Whether you’re a freelancer or an enterprise-level company, it’s important to consider how you and your teams work best. We suggest looking at how each task management tool handles collaboration, communication, views and pricing structure. Collaboration starts with your co-workers, but it also includes outsourced help and clients. If you need to share view-only boards with clients, ensure it offers that feature at the price point you can afford. Alternatively, some task management software lets you invite clients or collaborators as guests and you can set permissions for different users. Some task management tools are nothing but boards for listing and organizing tasks for a project. Others let users leave comments, send direct messages, start group chats or integrate with popular communication tools, such as Slack. Choose one that best fits your organization’s communication requirements. Kanban-style views are visual and very easy to use, but not everyone works best with that style of project management. If you need Gantt charts or a timeline view, be sure to consider what views each task management software offers as you whittle down your list of choices. Finally, pricing structure is a huge part of choosing the right task management tool. If you have a small team, a per-user, per-month pricing plan might work fine for your budget. Larger teams may want to consider an enterprise plan with a custom price or a flat-fee price with unlimited users allowed. The best task management software includes basic features to help you build and manage tasks and projects on the whole. Make sure these features are present even in the low-priced plans: Task management software is made better with collaboration tools. Without ways to collaborate, you’d still rely on email, phone calls and meetings to make sure everyone is on the same page. So, as you assign tasks, reassign projects and get feedback, it’s helpful to have all of that happen in one place. Look for these tools to help you collaborate within your task management software: The best task management software today is cloud-based, so you should be able to access your tasks and projects from any browser. Still, it’s important to ensure that your chosen task management software supports the devices your team and company use. Most software create mobile apps for iOS and Android, but not all. If not, make sure the browser version is optimized for mobile, at least. It’s equally important to check the integrations available with task management software. Just because there’s a missing feature in the software you want, there may be a way to integrate another app for a complete solution for your business. You may only need to add a time-tracking app to your stack or you might want to connect your CRM or accounting software, such as Salesforce or QuickBooks. Project and task management is notorious for ranging from simple to extremely complex. For larger businesses with multiple teams, there can be a lot of moving pieces with dependencies and various subtasks associated with each task. That’s why it’s vital to choose the right task management software for your team’s or company’s skills. The easiest task management software has intuitive interfaces with drag-and-drop functionality, so you can create and move tasks around on a board or list. These are great entry-level task management software options. As your team or business grows, you may want to migrate to a more advanced task management software that includes Gantt charts and real-time reporting that’s more helpful for managers and stakeholders. Knowing when to use free vs. paid task management software comes down to the size of your business, projects and budget. Freelancers and ultra-small businesses can likely get away with the limitations of a free task management software solution. Limits are usually applied to the number of users, collaborators, tasks or projects, file size or advanced features. As your needs grow, you may find you need to upgrade to a low- or mid-tier plan with more advanced features or fewer limitations. If you’re a manager who needs to view various reports to study a myriad of data, you might need to start off with a paid plan as these reports aren’t usually available on free plans. Another big difference between free vs. paid task management software is how the plans handle or allow workflow automation. Some free plans may allow some automation, but you’re likely limited to a set number of actions per month and you may be surprised at how quickly those run out. Workflow builders are key to reducing the time you spend doing the most mundane parts of task management, so it could be worth it to you to start off with a paid plan anyway. If project management software is the forest, then task management software is the trees. All types of businesses can benefit from using a task management tool to keep all team members, teams and departments in one organization on the same page. Here are the biggest benefits of using task management software: Task management software has a range of costs depending on the plan level you need and the size of your company. The average price of task management software ranges from $12.53 CAD per user, per month, to $25.92 CAD per user, per month (billed annually). That average doesn’t take into account enterprise-level plans that usually require a custom quote and can be much pricier. The best task management software offers free plans that won’t cost you a dime but features or users are limited. Alternatively, there is some task management software that has minimum user requirements. So even if the cost is low for a plan, say around $5 CAD per user, per month, it would cost you $15 CAD per month if there’s a three-user minimum. To determine the best task management software, Forbes Advisor researched the leading providers in the space and narrowed it down to the 11 top providers. We analyzed these across five primary categories for a total of 18 different metrics. The criteria were then weighted to favour features that matter most to small businesses. The best task management software had the best overall scores based on our methodology. Here are the overarching categories we analyzed: Free is always an attractive price point, but it may be too limiting for teams that need helpful features. While we ranked those with free plans a bit higher, we also took into account the starting price of each task management tool, along with user minimums. The best task management software is only as good as its functionality, allowances and workflow automations. After all, the whole point of using task management tools is to increase productivity and reduce repetitive work. We also considered the charts or views you get with each one because not everyone loves a spreadsheet or Kanban board. Every task management software offers a unique set of features in addition to the standard core feature set, so we considered other inclusions to gauge versatility and usefulness for various businesses and industries. This includes budgeting, markup tools, client access and billing and invoicing. We don’t want to rank products in an echo chamber, so we look to user reviews to help uncover popular features, excellent customer support experiences and drawbacks we may overlook in our testing and research. In addition to the above criteria, we also considered our own first-hand experience with task management software. This qualitative metric includes factors such as ease of use, value for money, popularity and the quality of available feature sets. Canadian specific editing and research (including pricing) conducted by Anna Rey. The best task management software depends on what features you need. Forbes Advisor compared the top options, and we concluded that the best task management tools are monday.com, Airtable and ClickUp. Task management software is used to create, track and organize tasks and subtasks within projects. It’s used by individuals who complete tasks, managers who assign tasks and stakeholders who want to see overviews and reports on all projects and tasks. There are multiple free task management tools available, although they typically limit the number of users, boards, tasks or automations per account. Some of the most popular free options for task management include Trello, monday.com and ClickUp. There is no universal answer to this question, but most task management software employs a variety of security measures to keep your data safe. Look for security features including data encryption, two-factor authentication and single sign-on. You can also set user permissions to allow or restrict access as needed. You may need to pay an additional fee for extra security to ensure Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) compliance. Aside from task management software and basic project management, there are also project management tools for specific industries. There’s construction project management software, such as Procore; enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, such as Oracle; and all-in-one work operating systems, such as HubSpot.
