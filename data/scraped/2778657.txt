Several decks and builds are viable in Marvel Snap, but the recurring meta of each season is altered slightly whenever new cards and locations attempt to break the mold. This is wonderful for fans who return to play matches frequently, especially with matches being so quick and accessible on players’ mobile devices. However, only a handful of decks are truly ever seen when playing consecutive matches, including move, destroy, Thanos, High Evolutionary, and discard builds. Discard decks in particular have a high-risk high-reward strategy, but Marvel Snap’s Blade rework has helped make it more dependable.
                         Many builds benefit from the strategy of being able to play any random assortment of cards that happen to be drawn from their deck, which is profoundly helpful when drawing cards in a random order each turn. If players are dependent on being able to play Bucky Barnes, Nova, and Carnage early to begin stacking Power points for Marvel Snap’s Knull, for example, but do not draw those cards until much later, Knull becomes far less effective. The discard build’s Blade was previously a wild card in this same regard, though his rework from early September now makes him a vital part of anyone’s discard deck and at the perfect time, too.

                     Before his rework, Blade discarded a random card from the player’s hand. This was effective due to the fact that he is a 1-Cost card in Marvel Snap and could help players begin discarding cards right from the first turn of a match, but it was equally risky depending on what other cards players had in their hands at the time. Therefore, if players were unlucky enough to draw Hela or another crucial discard card into their hand on the first turn, playing Blade could suddenly jeopardize the player’s entire strategy.
      Marvel Snap’s Sif is incredibly similar in terms of how risky it can be to play her since she discards the highest-cost card from the player’s hand, and Hela sits among that potential pool, so unless Hela’s not in the player’s hand it is also extremely risky to play Sif. Hellcow only further punctuates how high-risk discard builds are because, like Blade, its discard ability is also indiscriminate and is even worse since it discards two cards from the player’s hand.
                         Thankfully, Blade has since been reworked, so he now only discards the rightmost card in the player’s hand, which is an ability that players can completely construct a strategy around. In this case, fans can wait patiently for an Infinaut, Death, Giganto, or any other preferred card to arrive next in their hand and then play Blade to discard it.
                         Blade’s had this rework for almost a month, but it couldn’t have come sooner since he will be a large proponent of Marvel Snap’s newest season, Bloodstone. This October season begins rolling out today with its eponymous Elsa Bloodstone card being highlighted, though Ghost Rider and Blade are close behind as cards receiving their own themed variants for the season.
                         Ghost Rider exhuming and playing a card that had been discarded gives him and Blade great synergy, and while Elsa Bloodstone may not be the first card players think of for viability in a discard deck—her ability giving +3 Power to a card that fills a location—it is still a great season for discard deck enthusiasts nonetheless. Black Knight will ensure fans have even more to consider when packing their Marvel Snap decks, for instance, and it is fortunate that Blade is now a card players can rely upon to have in their discard decks as well.
      Marvel Snap is available on mobile devices and PC.
