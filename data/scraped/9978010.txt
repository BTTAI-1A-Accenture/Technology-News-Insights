ESPN posted a six-second video to social media platforms that had readers confused Thursday after the new Bucks star scored 39 points to help Milwaukee take down the Philadelphia 76ers. The video, showing up on ESPN's Instagram and SportsCenter on X/Twitter, appears to show Lillard in his Bucks jersey speaking to an unseen reporter, proclaiming, "Ain't nothing I want more. I told you when I first came here, I said I didn't come here to waste my time." DAME DIDN'T COME TO MILWAUKEE TO WASTE HIS TIME üó£Ô∏è pic.twitter.com/vw6Coa6JG0 ‚Äî SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) October 27, 2023 The posts include an editorial note, "DAME DIDN'T COME TO MILWAUKEE TO WASTE HIS TIME." But the interview was recorded in 2020, when Lillard was speaking in the Orlando "bubble," still as a member of the Blazers. Not only that, but the audio is from an interview that first appeared on TNT; ESPN digitally added a Bucks logo on the court, changed his uniform and even added an ESPN "flag" on the microphone to suggest the audio was first gathered by ESPN. That struck people as dishonest and ‚Ä¶ well, weird. The long length of the microphone screams "2020," and the NBA logo at center court should make it fairly clear that this isn't Fiserv Forum, not to mention that the Bucks didn't wear the style of jersey in Thursday's game that Lillard is given in the clip. More: Nickel: Damian Lillard shows why he's going to fit right in with the Milwaukee Bucks More: Damian Lillard adds to the great debuts in Wisconsin sports history The most charitable read is that ESPN wasn't making an earnest effort to mislead and intended to re-purpose (obvious?) old material for a fitting sound bite. But it landed oddly, particularly in an environment where AI coverage and "deep fake" videos have created an uneasy ripple through all media coverage. It's not as if Lillard didn't have things to say after his Milwaukee debut. ESPN responded to the Journal Sentinel with this statement: "We occasionally look to connect sports moments of the past with contemporary imagery and storylines as part of our social content. While it was never our intention to misrepresent anything for fans, we completely recognize how this instance caused confusion." I know who I am, I know what I am here to do, and I know how to do it."Damian Lillard after his first regular-season game in a #Bucks uniform.#FearTheDeer | #NBA pic.twitter.com/iRQqIk2ml6 ‚Äî Bally Sports Wisconsin (@BallySportWI) October 28, 2023 ESPN took an interview from 2020, edited Damian Lillard into a Bucks uniform, making it seem like he said these comments after his first game in Milwaukee in 2023. Posted it on ESPN Instagram with no disclaimer. pic.twitter.com/ALEuqRr7dx ‚Äî Bri Amaranthus (@BriAmaranthus) October 27, 2023 If this passes ESPN editorial standards, their journalistic days are over. As @DannyMarang spotted, the clip is manipulated w/o disclosure. It's an interview Lillard did in 2020 with TNT while a Blazer. ESPN edited his jersey and the mic flag and added a logo to the floor. https://t.co/lLGEuIiSnB ‚Äî Dylan McLemore (@voiceofD) October 27, 2023 This article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: ESPN posts Damian Lillard sound bite with digitally fabricated details Matt Harmon and Dr. Renee Miller explain the human psychology of some of the most common fantasy pitfalls on Friday's episode of 'Yahoo Fantasy Forecast'.
