In December, Naples art dealer Emillions Art asked the community to send in any happy picture taken at the Naples Pier, which was destroyed by Hurricane Ian.





The community did just that and more, giving artist Robin Austin some really great photos to work with. It took Austin three weeks to create this masterpiece.

You can see the individual images all coming together to re-create an even bigger image of the naples pier we all know and love.





“Everybody who was supporting the effort really got behind it. And it almost became a movement. I’m, as I said a moment ago, I think the results speak for itself,” said Austin.





“That artwork is being gifted today to the city and to the first responders. And then we have a select few that we are selling to the community and and then we’re personalizing people who place orders to their own tastes and like,” said Marlissa Gardner, president of Emillions Art.





A total of 2,000 photos were submitted to create the beautiful piece. Only a hundred limited edition works will be created. Some will be auctioned off, with a 100% of proceeds being donated to the Collier County 100-Club and the City of Naples for pier restoration.





Eighty are available for purchase, with 20% of proceeds going to the city and the Collier 100-Club.
