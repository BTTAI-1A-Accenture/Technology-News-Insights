Wigwe who was represented by the Chief Brand and Communications Officer Access Corporation, Mr Ameachi Okobi, said, “Pension systems do provide an income in the event of retirement, old age, or disability but they also serve a far greater purpose for our customers and communities.
“Apart from promoting long-term savings for sustainable investment and being a retirement savings account for our over 60 million customers, it also stabilises and grows economies.”
He added, “In line with our vision of creating a globally connected community and ecosystem inspired by Africa for the world, we want to start building first from Nigeria and then beyond. That is why we will work closely with our regulators to build this industry for a sustainable future for our community. Let’s shape the future we desire together.”        
The Managing Director, Access Pensions, Mr Dave Uduanu, said that with the merger of First Guarantee Pension and Sigma Pensions, Access Pensions has become one large, formidable organisation with the support of a strong parent in Access Corporation.
