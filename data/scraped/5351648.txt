Solutions to Nigeria’s newborn mortality rate might lie in existing innovations Research into more efficient AI hardware and software supported by AMD donation Imperial and Vietnamese partners explore UK and Vietnam's pathways to net zero    This event is now over Date: Tuesday, 14 March 2023 Organisation: Institut Élie Cartan de Lorraine This seminar will be presented in hybrid mode.  The speaker will deliver his talk in person. Abstract: We will start with a brief introduction about the main two lines of research associated with random NLS (nonlinear Schrödinger) equations. Then we will focus on the interpretation and well-posedness of a stochastic model driven by a space-time fractional noise. In the rough situation, this equation cannot be treated in a classical functional sense, making the interpretation of the nonlinearity a major issue. We will discuss about a possible renormalization procedure allowing to restore local well-posedness of the problem, provided the noise is not too rough. The talk is based on a joint work with Reika Fukuizumi and Laurent Thomann. The talk will be followed by refreshments in the Huxley Common Room at 5pm.
