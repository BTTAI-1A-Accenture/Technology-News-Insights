“The adaptability of our diversified portfolio of complementary businesses enabled us to successfully navigate an increasingly turbulent market in 2022 to produce a solid full year result,” stated Michael J. Kasbar, chairman and chief executive officer. “We have established a strong foundation for ratable growth and will leverage our global expertise to provide an expanding suite of products and services, including our evolving sustainability offerings, to deliver long-term value to our customers, suppliers and shareholders.”
 
“In 2022, our Adjusted EBITDA improved significantly year-over-year,” said Ira M. Birns, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “Despite higher energy prices in 2022, our strong EBITDA performance further enhanced our liquidity profile which provides greater capacity to invest in growth opportunities, while also continuing to return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.”

Definitions and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
This press release makes reference to "Net income." Net income means Net income attributable to World Fuel as presented in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
 
This press release contains non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Measures”), including the following:
 
The Non-GAAP Measures exclude acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments, gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt and gains or losses on sale of businesses, primarily because we do not believe they are reflective of our core operating results. Beginning with the period ending March 31, 2022, the Non-GAAP Measures exclude integration costs associated with our acquisitions and, since the fourth quarter of 2022, also exclude non-operating legal settlements related to a claim which resulted from a financing arrangement between a supplier and its bank. No changes to the comparable period were made as a result of the changes to the definition during the year ended December 31, 2022 as we did not incur integration costs or have non-operating settlements in 2021.
 
We believe that the Non-GAAP Measures, when considered in conjunction with our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, are useful to investors to further aid in evaluating the ongoing financial performance of the Company and to provide greater transparency as supplemental information to our GAAP results.
 
Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to the presentation of such metrics by other companies.
 
Adjusted net income attributable to World Fuel is defined as net income (loss) attributable to World Fuel excluding the impact of acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments, gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sale of businesses, integration costs, and non-operating legal settlements.
 
Adjusted diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing adjusted net income attributable to World Fuel and available to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock, stock units, restricted stock entitled to dividends not subject to forfeiture and vested restricted stock units outstanding during the period and the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if our outstanding potentially dilutive securities had been issued.
 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the impact of interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, in addition to acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments, gains or losses on sale of businesses, integration costs, and non-operating legal settlements. As the GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EBITDA is net income, the reconciliation was updated in the first quarter of 2022 to start with net income.
 
Adjusted income from operations is defined as Income from operations excluding the impact of acquisition and divestiture related expenses, restructuring charges, impairments, and integration costs. Adjusted income from operations as a percentage of gross profit is computed by dividing adjusted income from operations by gross profit.
 
Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP Measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in this press release and on our website.
 
Information Relating to Forward-Looking Statements
 
This release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our beliefs and expectations about our ability to leverage our global expertise to deliver long-term value to our customers, suppliers and shareholders, our expectations regarding returning capital to shareholders and our capacity for investment in growth opportunities. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by cautionary statements and risk factor disclosures contained in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings, including the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: customer and counterparty creditworthiness and our ability to collect accounts receivable and settle derivative contracts; sudden changes in the market price of fuel or extremely high or low fuel prices that continue for an extended period of time; adverse conditions in the industries in which our customers operate; our ability to effectively integrate and derive benefits from acquired businesses; our inability to effectively mitigate certain financial risks and other risks associated with derivatives and our physical fuel products; changes in the political, economic or regulatory environment generally and in the markets in which we operate, such as the current conflict in Eastern Europe; greenhouse gas reduction programs and other environmental and climate change legislation adopted by governments around the world, including cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, increased efficiency standards and mandates for renewable energy, each of which could increase our operating and compliance costs as well as adversely impact our sales of fuel products; changes in credit terms extended to us from our suppliers; non-performance of suppliers on their sale commitments and customers on their purchase commitments; non-performance of third-party service providers; our ability to meet financial forecasts associated with our operating plan; lower than expected cash flows and revenues, which could impair our ability to realize the value of recorded intangible assets and goodwill; the availability of cash and sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital and strategic investment needs; currency exchange fluctuations; inflationary pressures and their impact on our customers or the global economy, including sudden or significant increases in interest rates or a global recession; failure to meet fuel and other product specifications agreed with our customers; environmental and other risks associated with the storage, transportation and delivery of petroleum products; reputational harm from adverse publicity arising out of spills, environmental contamination or public perception about the impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry; risks associated with operating in high-risk locations, including supply disruptions, border closures and other logistical difficulties that arise when working in these areas; uninsured or underinsured losses; seasonal variability that adversely affects our revenues and operating results, as well as the impact of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and wildfires; declines in the value and liquidity of cash equivalents and investments; relationships with our employees and potential labor disputes associated with employees covered by collective bargaining agreements; our failure to comply with restrictions and covenants governing our senior revolving credit facility and our senior term loan, including our financial covenants; the impact of cyber and other information security-related incidents; changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, interpretations of such laws, changes in the mix of taxable income among different tax jurisdictions, or adverse results of tax audits, assessments, or disputes; our failure to generate sufficient future taxable income in jurisdictions with material deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards; the impact of the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit, on our business, operations and financial condition; our ability to comply with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, economic sanction programs and environmental matters; global health developments and economic uncertainty following the COVID-19 pandemic; the outcome of litigation and other proceedings, including the costs associated in defending any actions; and other risks detailed from time to time in our SEC filings. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors or to assess the impact of such risks on our business. Accordingly, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, changes in expectations, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
