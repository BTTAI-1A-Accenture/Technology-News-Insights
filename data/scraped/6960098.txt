As global finance evolves, the need for bigger, better, decentralized blockchain technology solutions rises. Over the last few years, thousands of DeFi projects that aim to improve the global financial system have emerged. As crypto firms seek Hong Kong banking solutions, TMS Network (TMSN) has quickly become a top contender, surpassing coins like Filecoin (FIL) and BNB (BNB) in value and popularity. TMS Network (TMSN)’s user-friendly and innovative technology has attracted market bulls and investors who have pushed its presale raise to $4 million. Read on to learn more. 
Filecoin (FIL) Sees Slow Adoption, Struggles to Regain 2022 Loss
As its name implies, Filecoin (FIL) is a decentralized blockchain-based file and data management protocol. Launched in 2014, Filecoin (FIL) was designed to help traditional enterprises and businesses leverage blockchain to secure, store, and access data. It also provides excellent file management solutions by directly cutting out file hacks and compromising risks.
However, for weeks, the Filecoin (FIL) token has been struggling to maintain its ground after losing much of its value to the bear market of 2022. Filecoin (FIL) token clinched an all-time high of $237 in April 2021 but has been on an unending downtrend and has lost investors’ confidence. In fact, many investors had to sell off their holdings when the token hit rock bottom at $2.8 – about a 99% loss. However, as 2023 unfolds, investors find solace in new profitable projects with captivating use cases like TMS Network (TMSN).
BNB (BNB) Wither as Bearish Pressure Intensifies
Like Filecoin (FIL), Binance’s native token, BNB (BNB) coin has performed exceptionally well in its early days. At its peak, the BNB (BNB) token clinched an all-time high of $690 from a meager launched price of less than $1 in the May 2021 bull run. However, BNB (BNB) did not escape the bear pulldown of 2022 and lost over 73% of its value. While 2023 has been favorable for many tokens, including BNB (BNB), its price continues to face threats from bearish sentiments and unfavorable market conditions.
One of the factors driving BNB (BNB)’s price down is Binance’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which Binance of running a sham exchange. This has raised concerns about Binance’s viability and BNB (BNB)’s confidence as a profitable investment. Subsequently, Binance and its BNB (BNB) token gas lost much interest, with users withdrawing over $1.6 billion in assets since the debacle started. Currently, the BNB (BNB) token is trading at $313 – about 55% below the ATH price.

TMS Network (TMSN) Token Gain 900% in Presale, Surpass $4 Million Raise
While Filecoin (FIL) and BNB (BNB) are moving sideways, TMS Network (TMSN), a new decentralized trading protocol that blends derivative asset trading with blockchain technology, is taking over the crypto market with revolutionary trading solutions. For weeks, TMS Network (TMSN) has ignited the financial market with disruptive tools to address traditional trading issues.
One of the core missions of TMS Network (TMSN) is making the ‘Do Your Own Research’ mantra easier with trader education. It provides an all-in-one solution for anyone to build their wealth seamlessly and autonomously. TMS Network (TMSN) aims to make reading easier with robust advanced AI tools, trading algorithms, and software that can help new and professional traders increase their profitability.
Using TMS Network (TMSN) is easier – all you have to do is connect your wallet. Once you’re a token holder, you can earn passive income, governance rights, and premium trading services. Aside from these, users get impenetrable security, high-speed trading, competitive trading fees, and massive scalability.
TMS Network (TMSN) tokens are available in the second presale stage that is about to sell out earlier than speculated. Unlike Filecoin (FIL) and BNB (BNB), the token continues to see positive sentiments with a humongous growth of 2240% in presale price and over $4 million raised. Currently, the TMS Network (TMSN) token is trading at $0.05, with demand shooting up daily. This shows how much of a game-changer TMS Network (TMSN) is.
