  Paynoneer the global payment processing system has now opened its wire transfer services for banks in Pakistan.Anyone with a Payoneer account will be able to transfer funds from their Payoneer account to a local bank account in Pakistan. This is essentially going to help Pakistani freelancers who face trouble in charging their foreign clients; especially when other popular services dont work in Pakistan, according to a statement. A Payoneer account can accept payments from anyone in the world.Earlier Freelancers used to withdraw their funds through Payoneer ATMs, which was an expensive sport, since thereâ€™s notable transaction charge of PKR 750 attached with every transaction users do with Payoneer ATM withdrawals.Now Payoneer users can simply add their Pakistani bank accounts and request for a withdrawal. The Payoneer account can be used with a MasterCard-enabled prepaid card, so the users are able to draw money from local ATMs that support MasterCard.
