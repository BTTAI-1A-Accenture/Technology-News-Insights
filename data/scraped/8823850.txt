 Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making your website visible to search engines, such as Google, in a way that gives your site preferential visibility. When your website is optimized for search, you improve the likelihood that your site will rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs) and thus be more visible to those searching for your services or products. Effective SEO is crucial for driving quality traffic to your website. The goal of SEO is to help those interested in your business offerings find you online. Optimizing your site for search improves the odds that those performing related online searches will find your company and click through to your website. High click-through rates (CTRs) increase the opportunities you have to engage with your website visitors, make a connection and either make a sale or establish a relationship that sets the stage for closing a sale down the line. There are two ways to drive traffic to your website: organically or via paid methods. SEO is an organic search strategy that optimizes your site with the best content that satisfies searcher intentions. Search engine marketing (SEM) involves all digital marketing strategies—both paid and organic—used to drive traffic to your website via search engines. SEM often involves SEO and paid search strategies, such as pay-per-click advertisements. When selecting an SEO service, you should first consider your SEO goals. Then, spend time with a few SEO service providers to discuss those needs in light of what each agency delivers. It’s also helpful to speak with current or past clients. SEO service providers help you increase your visibility in search engines and thereby assist you in generating more traffic for your website. An SEO service provider may conduct a variety of tasks, including auditing your existing website for SEO effectiveness, conducting keyword searches, developing an SEO plan to outrank your competition and writing SEO copy for your site. Before purchasing SEO services, it’s wise to get a handle on the different types of SEO available. Understanding the basics will give you a considerable advantage when evaluating SEO agencies. When evaluating SEO service providers, be sure to look at their client portfolio and case studies that detail what they’ve accomplished for others. Pay attention to whether the SEO service specializes in specific industries or audiences and their typical client size. Get a clear idea of what results might be possible—based on what the provider has done for others—as well as how long it will take for the new SEO efforts to start gaining traction. If you’re working with a strong SEO agency, you should start seeing some positive results within 60 to 90 days of initial strategy implementation, but keep in mind that it may take 120 days or longer to make a significant impact. When interviewing SEO providers, check for competitive conflicts. If an agency represents multiple companies targeting the same search content in the same, limited local market, that’s a potential red flag. While that type of SEO agency likely understands your market well, it is also likely using similar SEO strategies for direct competitors, which may put you at a disadvantage in tight local competitive climates. It’s best to work with a provider that offers complete transparency on what they will do for you and how they’ll generate and report results. Some SEO agencies merely use powerful SEO analysis software such as Ahrefs, KWFinder or Semrush and regurgitate findings in the form of polished SEO reports for their clients. You could do that level of SEO on your own, and likely for a much lower cost than hiring an SEO agency. While the search statistics from top SEO software programs are helpful, stats alone are insufficient. When evaluating SEO service providers, make them explain how they add value to your SEO efforts beyond what you could do for yourself via an off-the-shelf SEO software. Your SEO agency should deliver actionable insights on where and how to adjust your website content to achieve optimal search visibility. Your SEO provider should also help you better understand your search competition plus uncover untapped or under-tapped opportunities to elevate your search rankings. Before agreeing to work with anyone, ask for a full accounting of what metrics will be reported, when the numbers will be reported and how performance trends will be tracked and reported over time. Your SEO service provider should offer detailed progress reports every month so you can measure the return on investment (ROI) of your SEO expenditures. White hat SEO refers to tactics that are aligned with search engine best practices. If an SEO tactic is Google-approved, you are safe to use it for your website. Black hat SEO refers to tactics that aim to improve a website’s visibility in search using more manipulative methods that distort reality. Black hat tactics are banned by Google and could result in a traffic-dropping Google penalty or get your site blocked by search engines permanently. Examples of black hat SEO include keyword stuffing, link spam, link exchanges, hidden text or links, buying backlinks and sneaky redirects. It’s important to vet your vendors well to ensure they only use white hat SEO tactics. You can and should expect exceptional customer service from your SEO partner. One way to assess a provider’s reputation is to search online for reviews written by actual customers. If you’re working with a local business, check out customer reviews on their Google Business Profile page. Another way to learn more about what you can expect in terms of service quality is to ask your professional network whether anyone has worked with a specific agency. Getting feedback from someone you know and trust is ideal. You can also ask the SEO agency you’re considering working with for customer references and speak directly with an active customer. Every SEO service provider varies a bit in the type of services offered. Service essentials include SEO audits, keyword research, link building services, competition analyses, website reputation management and optimized content development services. An SEO audit is an evaluation of the current state of your website, factoring in on-page SEO, off-page SEO and technical SEO. The SEO audit is the first step of effective optimization, so if you haven’t had a full SEO audit lately, you likely need one. A quality SEO service provider will conduct an extensive SEO audit of your website before making recommended changes. Your audit should include insights into keywords you’re currently ranking for, crawling and indexing errors, internal and external link analyses, site architecture effectiveness, page speed analytics, mobile responsiveness and other details on duplicate or otherwise problematic content issues. A keyword is a single word or string of related words that people enter into the search bar when conducting a web search. To maximize website traffic, you want your website to rank high for all the keywords related to the services or products you sell. You also want to know what keywords people use, so you can adapt or create website content that ranks high on Google. Keyword research is essential to effective SEO. Your SEO service provider should monitor which keyword you’re ranking for, how high each keyword is ranking and track keyword progress as the site is optimized. Your agency should also provide new keyword suggestions to help your site perform well in search results. Many SEO agencies provide link building services to help you get more backlinks to your website. When a high-authority site links to your website, that elevates your website’s credibility and trustworthiness. Backlinks are a top search ranking factor, and an SEO agency can often help you build quality backlinks to your site through digital public relations and other outreach link building services. You want your website content to appear higher in search results than other sites vying for the same attention. To do this, you need a solid grasp on who your main search competitors are, what they’re doing, where they’re outperforming you and what keywords they rank for that you don’t. A strong SEO agency should deliver exceptional competitive analyses while developing effective SEO strategies so your website can outrank competitors. Online reputation management services are designed for those who want to boost their website’s authority and credibility. Reputation services can help you control how your business is perceived online. Services typically include generating positive business reviews and actively pursuing opportunities for reputation elevation through social media and public relations initiatives. You may acquire reputation management services to help create a positive online image when your website is new or assist with damage control if your business has suffered a public ding to its reputation. Website reputation management services are also popular for websites that have incurred a Google penalty and need to restore their reputation, so that Google will lift the penalty. Many SEO agencies offer optimized content development services. Popular content services include blog writing, video content development and website copywriting services. Before committing to any agency, ask if content development services are offered and, if so, how these services are priced. SEO service pricing is typically done on either a project or monthly retainer basis. You may pay an upfront fee for your initial audit and existing site optimization. If you want to work with a service provider for ongoing SEO support, you’ll likely need to enter into a multi-month or annual contract. A longer contract commitment is often required because SEO efforts take several months to yield results. Several factors determine how much SEO services will cost for your small business. The volume and veracity of online competition, the number of pages you need to optimize, how effectively—or ineffectively—your current site is already optimized and the service provider you select can all impact your total SEO costs. When working with an SEO agency for the first time, you may be presented with several SEO service options, with tier pricing relative to the level of service you’ll receive. Before signing a contract, make sure you are clear on the deliverables. Forbes Advisor gathered thousands of data points from more than a hundred SEO service providers to create this list of the best SEO services. We considered the depth and breadth of SEO services offered, including keyword research, on-page and off-page SEO, competitor tracking and analysis, technical audits, link-building and search-optimized content development services. We also scoured hundreds of online reviews from actual customers to assess SEO service providers’ reputation for responsiveness, technical proficiency, quality control, project management, progress tracking and reporting, and success at achieving significant ROI. 1 Serpstat Free trial 7 days 50 tools+ for SEO and PPC professionals, marketing experts and big digital agencies Analyze websites & keywords, generate content, check backlinks, find on-page SEO issues, cluster tons of keywords and track rankings daily Monthly & annual plans Yes On Serpstat’s secure website Forbes Advisor adheres to strict editorial integrity standards.

SEO is a good investment for small businesses that depend on prospective customers finding them online. Optimizing your website for search engines is one of the most cost-effective ways of increasing your visibility to prospects who are already searching online for the services or products your small business offers. You can do SEO yourself, though you’ll need to build your SEO knowledge about keyword research, link building, technical SEO, on-page SEO and off-page SEO. Several online tutorials are available to help you build your skills. You want to select relevant keywords for your content; be sure you’re targeting specific keywords that your ideal audience uses in their search strings. For optimal results, look for keywords with high traffic volumes and minimal keyword difficulty, though these keywords can be challenging to find. Generally, it takes 60 to 90 days before you see initial results from SEO and 120 days or longer before you see significant results. You’re never really “done” with SEO; as more content is added to the internet daily, you need an ongoing SEO strategy that addresses emerging competition and search patterns. White label SEO is when one entity performs the SEO services, but the services are promoted and sold by another agency. It’s not uncommon for marketing firms with strong expertise in design, copywriting or marketing strategy to outsource their SEO work to white label SEO providers. For some marketing agencies, it can be more affordable and effective to use white label SEO than developing in-house SEO capabilities. Blogs can help you improve your website SEO by expanding your visibility in search. Blogs add content to your website that people are looking for via Google and other search engines. When you have more optimized content on your website—targeted to a wider variety of keywords—you increase your chances of generating more traffic from organic searches. When another website links to a page on your website, that’s called a backlink. Also called inbound links, backlinks from trusted websites prove to Google that your content is trustworthy. High-quality backlinks are one of many factors Google considers when deciding how high to rank your website in search results pages. The best way to improve your website’s search ranking is to make it more authoritative. Providing authoritative content that web searchers are looking for and find useful is key to high rankings. As with most types of software, the best SEO software programs offer many levels of security. When choosing this type of software, you want to look for security features such as documentation that shows frequent security updates and patches, intrusion detection, two-factor authentication (2FA) or multifactor authentication (MFA), data encryption, privacy protection and the monitoring of user activities. Two types of links impact your SEO success: internal links and external links. You need a good internal linking plan to build topical authority on your website, i.e., to show you have deep knowledge about the subjects your website discusses. A good external linking strategy—where you link to highly reputable websites—further establishes your credibility. The Forbes Advisor editorial team is independent and objective.
