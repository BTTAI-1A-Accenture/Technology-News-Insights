Other features include tax form printing, deduction management, vacation accrual and workers’ compensation reporting, job expense tracking, variable income tracking and payroll processing, timecard tracking and salary or hourly payroll options. The free version only covers up to 50 active or currently paid employees, although its database can hold up to 1,000 employees. Nonprofits can exceed that limit upon request.

 To decide which providers made the cut for this guide, we assessed the available free payroll software to determine which would best meet freelancer, startup and small business needs. This assessment was based on the software’s free plan features and functionality, free plan limitations, add-ons and extra fees (if any), upgrade options and customer reviews. Below is a deeper look at our assessment process. Pricing – 20% In putting together this guide, we aimed to include software with feature sets that went beyond the expected. Such added features included HR functions and capabilities, reporting, employee portals, multiple payment format options―check and direct deposit―deduction management and unexpected security features, such as biometric face recognition. Additionally, as we assessed the free plans’ features and functionality, we paid close attention to the limitations the free plans imposed on small businesses. The limitations assessed included the number of employees the software would allow businesses to pay or even maximum and minimum amounts businesses could pay each employee to qualify for free software usage. We weighted pricing at 20% of our total score. Features – 30% We worked to uncover plans that were truly free without extra fees for essential features. We also looked for plans with nice-to-have add-ons that users could take advantage of as their budgets permit. The essential general features we looked for included having a self-service employee portal and offering contractor payments. Other good-to-have features included new hire onboarding. third-party integrations, ledger reports and other reporting and analytics offerings. In ranking the top free payroll software, we prioritized the providers that offered paid, more full-featured plans so freelancers, startups and small businesses can start with the free plan, then advance to plans that fit their needs as they grow. Features accounted for 30% of our final score. Third-Party Reviews – 15% As we chose providers for this guide, we listened attentively to what customers who have and are using the software had to say about it. Namely, we looked at what software features, capabilities or services met their needs—or, better yet, delighted them—and which inherent bottlenecks kept customers from meeting business goals. These accounted for 15% of the total score. Expert Analysis – 35% Using our market research and close scrutiny of the categories listed above, we also ranked additional criteria from customer reviews, such as any detailed or stand-out features, popularity, ease of use and value for the money. Altogether, these criteria made up 35% of the total score. As you are looking for free payroll software, it is important to first assess whether the chosen software will help you both pay employees and meet legal requirements for your business. This means that the free payroll software should calculate state, local and federal taxes so that they can be deducted properly from employees’ paychecks and paid in a timely and accurate manner. Many will also let you download payroll data yearly for your tax records. Next, assess the software carefully to ensure it is truly free. Some software options are listed as free but, in reality, you must pay for essential add-ons or underlying technology for the software. For example, some free payroll software requires paid software as a foundation to run the free payroll application. In other circumstances, to meet legal payroll requirements, users have to pay for add-ons that are not included in the free version. Finally, pay close attention to what users have said by accessing software review sites and articles. Learn the obstacles and friction points users face while using the free version. Also, find out if customers were delighted by unexpected features that are normally only offered in paid versions, features that could help you uniquely meet business needs. Finally, look for stated hidden fees not listed on the software’s website. Forbes Advisor adheres to strict editorial integrity standards.
