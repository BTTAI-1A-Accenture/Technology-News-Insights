Hereâs what to evaluate when comparing business checking account options: Youâll find similar business banking solutions with online and in-personal financial institutions. That said, there are some key differences to be aware of: Ultimately, choosing between the two depends on your preferences and specific business needs. Visit the financial institutionâs website to learn how to apply. Many banks and credit unions offer online applications to streamline the process. Others require you to visit a branch to open an account. If you plan to use an online bank, youâll likely have to apply online and upload the required documents. Either way, hereâs what youâll typically need to get started: If thereâs a minimum opening deposit requirement, youâll also need it handy. Online applicants are prompted to provide account information to make the initial deposit. You should consider opening a business checking account if you own a business. This includes self-employed individuals operating as sole proprietors, independent contractors, gig workers and freelancers. Business checking accounts are also ideal for limited liability companies (LLCs), corporations and partnerships. The benefits of opening a business checking account for your company are numerous. Youâll avoid commingling personal and business assets. Plus, youâll help protect your personal assets from claims made by creditors for business debt. The same applies to negative financial consequences caused by other legal matters. To compile our list of top options, we considered several factors, including accessibility, APYs, monthly maintenance fees, monthly minimum balance requirements, minimum opening deposits and ATM fees. We also evaluated the mobile banking platform, ATM network, small business resources and reputability of the financial institutions. A business checking account is a type of bank account used to make business-related transactions. You can deposit funds, make purchases with your debit card or using ACH payment, initiate withdrawals, write checks and pay bills. Some financial institutions also allow you to process payroll and make wire transfers. Thereâs no rule prohibiting you from using a personal bank account for your small business. However, itâs not advisable to mix personal and business affairs. Doing so could lead your personal assets to get seized if the business runs into problems. Plus, itâll be difficult to properly maintain your companyâs books and records needed for tax time. Youâll also have a tough time proving your companyâs financial status and creditworthiness to lenders should you decide to apply for debt products in the future. Small businesses should have at least two accounts â a checking and a savings account. However, your company may need more accounts. It depends on your industry and the scope of daily operations. A business checking account operates like a personal checking account. However, itâs used solely to help manage your companyâs funds. Youâll also find that the fees are generally higher. If the credit union youâre considering offers commercial solutions, it could be a viable option. Their business checking accounts generally come with lower fees and more generous returns compared to traditional brick-and-mortar banks. That said, youâll need to apply for membership to open an account with a credit union. Also, consider the accessibility of the credit union. Many are limited to a local geographic area, which could be problematic if you receive a high volume of cash and need to make deposits often. Most financial institutions require more than just an EIN number to open a business checking account. Check with the bank, credit union or online platform to learn more about documentation requirements before moving forward with your application to open a business account. * Found is a financial technology company, not a bank.
