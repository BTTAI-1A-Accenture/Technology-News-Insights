Menu ALICE, Texas â€” An Alice man is in custody after being charged for the murder of his estranged wife. According to Jim Wells County Sheriff Daniel Bueno, on Thursday around 1:43 a.m., deputies were sent to a home on County Road 1554 after a 10-year-old girl called for help. When they arrived on-scene, deputies found 44-year-old Rebecca Letson had been shot. Bueno said the 10-year-old girl was Letson's daughter, who told deputies her father allegedly shot her mother. Bueno told KRIS 6 News it appeared Letson was shot and killed with a shotgun. 42-year-old Paul Anthony Vasquez was arrested following a traffic stop at Main Street for reckless driving and was later charged with driving under the influence. After further investigation, Vasquez was served with a warrant Thursday afternoon and charged for murder, officials said. His bond is $1 million. It is still unclear what lead up to the shooting, but Bueno said Vasquez had a history of violence. "It's a very sad situation," Bueno said. The Jim Wells County Sheriff's Office and the Texas Rangers are investigating the case. The 10-year-old girl was with Child Protective Services before she was placed with other family members.
