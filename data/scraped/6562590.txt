Day trading guide for today: Domestic equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended higher in Tuesday's session led by fag-end buying, despite weak global cues after China cut interest rates by less than expected. Sensex closed with a gain of 159 points, or 0.25 per cent, at 63,327.70 while the Nifty ended at 18,816.70, up 61 points, or 0.33 per cent.

On the outlook for Nifty today, Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Research (Retail), Kotak Securities observes that Nifty took support near 18,650 and bounced back sharply. He said on intraday charts, the index formed a double bottom formation which is indicating the continuation of an uptrend formation in the near future. "For the day traders, 18,750 would be the trend decider level. Above the same, the index could rally to 18,900-18,925. Below 18,750, the selling pressure is likely to accelerate and the index could retest the level of 18,650-18,620," said Chouhan. On the outlook for Bank Nifty, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said the Bank Nifty index saw the bulls hold a support level of 43,400. Currently, the index is trading within a broad range between 43,400 and 44,000. "A breakout on either side of this range is likely to result in trending moves. As long as the support level of 43,400 is held, a buy-on-dip approach is suggested. Once the index surpasses the level of 44,000 it will witness sharp short covering on the upside towards 45,000 levels," said Shah.  Advising stock market traders to keep a check on their positions, Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research, Religare Broking said, ‘’Nifty has respected the trend line support around 18,660 levels and witnessed a steady rebound. This move shows that bulls are in control and the tone would remain positive till it holds 18,550. Traders should align their positions accordingly but suggest keeping a check on the size of positions citing intermediate choppiness.'' The market witnessed cautious trading y due to weak global cues, with heightened concerns over the Chinese economy following their decision to cut interest rates after a 10-month pause. "Multiple factors such as mounting Chinese growth fears, anxiety ahead of Powell's testimony and delayed monsoon have sparked caution," said Prashanth Tapse, senior vice president for research at Mehta Equities.   Two stocks will be in focus in Wednesday's session as they will turn ex-date for their bonus issue.
