It currently bakes around 16 million Scotch pies annually. Ronnie Miles, managing director at Bells Food Group, told Lanarkshire Live: "We’re really proud to be in Scotland’s top five, alongside esteemed brands such as Irn Bru, Graham’s, Tunnock’s and Mackie’s. "Continued investment, innovation and brand relevance has helped us attract and retain shoppers to maintain this position but ultimately it’s down to the talents and dedication of our team. “Our most recent investment will see us significantly increase the quantity of pies we can bake in the factory and will enable us to meet projected increased demand for the years ahead.” Lesley Ann Gray, Kantar Worldpanel strategic insight director, added: "The enduring stability of the Scottish top five brands reminds us that brand-building is a long-term game. "The growth stories behind the brands all reflect the same theme - winning more shoppers by giving them more reasons and opportunities to buy. "Creating that virtuous circle of rising shopper engagement, sales, and in-store presence takes time, clarity of direction and investment." Bells has an annual turnover of around £26 million, employs about 220 staff members, has 60 per cent of the hot pie market in Scotland and operates two bakeries and a distribution centre in Shotts. The company’s story began in 1931 when, fearing his son Donald would be out of work after completing an apprenticeship at a local bakery in 1931, David Bell converted the family wash-house into a small bakery and Donald started the business, selling scones and pancakes in the early hours of the morning door-to-door. As the business grew Donald’s four brothers and two sisters joined and the introduction and success of Bells' ‘Special’ Puff Pastry, which was launched in 1955, allowed the company to expand into other savoury products. * Don't miss the latest headlines from around Lanarkshire.
