AT2 Aerospace will be responsible for continued development of the Z1, the company's proposed hybrid airship. Lockheed Martin said it believes in the potential for hybrid airships to transform global transport and has been in search of a transition partner to continue development of  commercial work. Now the company's hybrid airship IP and related assets have been transitioned to a newly formed, commercial company called AT2 Aerospace. AT2 Aerospace, based in Santa Clarita, California, is extending the work to bring hybrid airships to fruition. The AT2 team is developing airship solutions to support commercial and humanitarian applications around the world.  Dr. Robert Boyd, retired Lockheed Martin Hybrid Airship program manager, is President of AT2 Aerospace. AT2 Aerospace will be responsible for continued development of the Z1, the company's proposed hybrid airship. The craft will feature an Air Cushion Landing System (ACLS) that allows it to land and takeoff from almost any location on the planet. It also uses buoyant lift technology for delivering improved fuel efficiency, minimized carbon emissions, and reduced transportation costs. The company expects the Z1 will connect emerging economies to global trade networks while being able to move cargo faster than sea and land transportation at a fraction of the cost of existing cargo aircraft.
