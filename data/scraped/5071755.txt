ExpandWith a title on the line and two matches left, Northview sophomore Alejandra Sanchez (126 pounds) sent the Vikings faithful into a frenzy with a match-clinching victory.With her match tied, 4-4, in the third period, Sanchez began to slowly drag her opponent, Kristen Dizon, toward the edge of the mat. With 20 seconds left, she escaped and received a point in the last few seconds for the win.“It feels really good,” said Sanchez, who was still shaking from her excitement. “I was really nervous for it, but I did it.”Sanchez described how she pulled it out.“I knew I had to get out and not stay inside the circle, so I forced my legs and got up,” Sanchez said. “I was looking at the scoreboard the whole time. I was looking straight ahead and the coaches were right beneath it, so I just looked up and I saw them for a short time.”

Sanchez, who had a record of 24-6 entering the match, had faced her opponent, Dizon, a sophomore, earlier in the season and pinned her.With her win, the Vikings held a 37-28 lead with one match to go, but they had clinched the championship.In the final match, Corona’s Katrina Cortez pinned Northviews’ Sophia Gomez with .06 seconds left in the match for six points.“These are the two premier programs and I guess we should have expected a close match,” Northview girls coach Roy Lazaro said. “Definitely, a lot of things went right for him (Corona coach Jim Bowers) from the start.”Actually, Northview started out with a 19-0 lead with four straight wins that were highlighted by consecutive pins by junior Trinity Palumbo (150 pounds), and No. 1 state-ranked senior Johanna Forman (160 pounds), who is a two-time state champion.“I think it was such an important thing for us just to go out there and win because it was our last dual as seniors,” Forman said.Corona began to make its comeback with three consecutive wins — a 9-0 major decision (Angel Castro, 170 pounds), and pins by Alexandra Uata (191 pounds) and Lorelei Hartman (heavyweight) to trail 19-16.“They started to swing momentum their way, so that’s why at 101’s I had to put in my senior veteran (Lexi Garza), who I could count on to try and get that momentum back on our side,” Lazaro said.It was a last-minute change and it worked to perfection.Garza pinned Corona’s Savanna Melancon with 35 seconds left in the second period for a 25-16 lead.Corona won the next two matches by pins and took their first lead of the match, 28-25, with four matches left.Lazaro’s daughter, Leilani Lazaro (118 pounds), pinned Corona’s Kylie Martinez with 1:05 left in the first period for a 31-28 lead.“Since we wrestled them last year, we kind of expected that we were going to go through some hard times, but (our) team is really different and we blew them out of the water,” said Leilani Lazaro, who has a 29-1 record.Northviews’ Samantha Rivera (123) won by decision, followed by Sanchez’s victory.“It was an honor to see the Northview Girls team win today on National Girls in Sports Day,” Covina-Valley Unified School District Superintendent Elizabeth Eminhizer said. “It was a highly competitive wrestling meet with two of the top teams in the state. It’s really amazing to see this level of competition in a sport that has been historically dominated by males.”  Northview defeated Corona, 37-34, Wednesday night to win its second consecutive CIF Southern Section Division 1 duals meet championship. It was the second year in a row Northview defeated Corona in the finals, and it’s the third straight time the two teams met in the finals.
