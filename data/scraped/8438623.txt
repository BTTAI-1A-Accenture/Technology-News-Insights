     Slack employees are taking this week off — but not for a fall vacation. The Salesforce-owned workplace chat app is pausing operations to give staff time to complete their internal training, Fortune reports. Workers are expected to reach "Ranger status" on Salesforce's Trailhead online learning platform, which requires about 40 hours to accomplish; modules include “Learn about the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and “Healthy Eating.” The challenge has been met with skepticism by some employees, since Salesforce also promotes Trailhead to other companies as a tool to "upskill" their workers.

             WILD NEWS out of the Salesforce/Slack Camp

Employees are gaming trailhead by creating code to automate clicks through training.

Meanwhile - Slack is SHUTTING DOWN (costing the company millions) for a whole week so employees can get caught up on company and product training.

I remember having to take company and product training via Trailhead when I was at Salesforce. 

I was SUPER busy, and didn't want to make time to do the training.

But I did it - because I am adult and I had an employer that asked me to do something to make me a better performing employee.  

....Oh...and I was the top performing Rep while I was there. 

People are getting so soft - these same people gaming the system are probably the same people that complain about their cushy tech job being "hard" and asking for better working conditions while enjoying arguably the BEST company benefits package on planet earth.

             It makes sense to have your employees utilize your own product. Including any possible exploits. Particularly if the product is training based.

             When everyone in the organization is focused on one task then there are no interferences for accomplishing that task. Kudos to Slack! #Slack

             Slack requiring employees to take a week off to catch up on training!

IMO, this is a result of 2 key issues. 
1) Ensuring that training is easily accessible so that employees can participate at any time
2) Making the training relevant and interesting

Over the past 7 years we have seen a significant increase in completion rates when users can easily access training at any time or place and when employees see the value in what is being offered.

Slack staff have been asked to set aside recurring internal meetings to complete 40 hours of training on Salesforce's Trailhead learning platform. 

Employees are instead gaming the system by developing code which automates tasks and clicks through modules on the platform. 

Some of the modules include topics like healthy eating and the fourth industrial revolution.

             There are few articles in my morning news feed that bring out a cheer. When companies like Salesforce prioritize L&D I feel hopeful that others will begin to put learning and growth higher on their priorities list. 

Employees benefit, leadership benefits, profits follow when the learning is handled properly. #InvestInPeople Going all out to build a great company - if you are too, let's roll | Owner/CEO at Catco Elizabeth Kachur L&D is one of those Stephen Covey "Quadrant 2" activities. IMPORTANT but not URGENT. It will always get swallowed up by crises and BS if time and space aren't created for it.

             Slack pausing operations next week so employees can put in 40 hours of training to obtain ranger status on Trailhead. 

How progressive right?

Well maybe, but when it’s for topics of “Learn about the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and “Healthy Eating.”

Thoughts?

https://lnkd.in/efb3cT3i Data Officer & Sr Director Enterprise Data Management training for people is great, yet when it's forced like this there will be people that resist or as the article mentions people will find work arounds. This doesn't feel like a genuine gesture. It's probably in someone goals so this will help them get a bonus
