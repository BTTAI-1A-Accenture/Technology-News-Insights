 So, youâ€™ve gotten past the first level in the game of job seeking: your resume was plucked from a pile of hopefuls. Congrats! Now, things are about to level up: itâ€™s interview time, baby. Most interviews follow a predictable script: questions about your background, career journey, work youâ€™re proud of, challenges youâ€™ve overcome, why youâ€™re looking for a new job, yada yada yada...Â  Note I did not yada over the best part, which is when itâ€™s YOUR turn to ask some questions. For me, this is where the real interview begins.Â  You donâ€™t want to do a complete 180 and interview the interviewer, but asking a couple of impactful questions can really give you an edge. Here are some of my favourite questions Iâ€™ve asked (or have been asked) in interviews.Â   Not only does this show your eagerness to get started, it will provide clarity around your immediate responsibilities and help you mentally prepare for what your days might look like in this role. This is helpful to identify any technical knowledge gaps (e.g. if youâ€™ve never used HubSpot before) or strengths (e.g. being able to say youâ€™re a HubSpot pro). For any gaps, you can be proactive and offer to upskill before you start, or come up with a plan during your onboarding.Â  This is a great question to show youâ€™re committed to delivering results. It also sheds light on performance expectations, and could even raise a red flag if you don't get a clear answer. How will you know if youâ€™re meeting your goals if you canâ€™t see the goalposts?Â  We love a little psychological play. This question starts planting a vision of you being with the company in 6 monthsâ€™ time in the mind of your interviewer, plus it shows youâ€™re an ambitious long-term thinker.Â One of my faves. Again, this shows that youâ€™re thinking about your growth and future with the company. It will also tell you if and how the company invests in the professional development of its employees.Â  Note: this can be tricky for start-ups and small businesses to answer as thereâ€™s not always a linear career pathway or clear â€˜bandsâ€™, but every company should at least be able to share what their version of progression looks like. Another opportunity to show your interest in the companyâ€™s long-term vision and goals, while also vetting if thereâ€™s a clear road ahead for the business or if things are a bit up in the air. You have to be pretty game to ask this one but it can be incredibly revealing, both about the challenges of the business and their willingness to be transparent with you. Of course, youâ€™re basically a stranger so the answer will likely be filtered, but how they respond is whatâ€™s important here. People are asking me this more and more in interviews and I love it! In this post-Covid, remote-work world, candidates have more choice than ever and cultural fit / alignment of values have become more of a consideration they once were.Â  Related to the above, this question should show you what the company culture and values look like in practice. If you are being interviewed by more than one person, itâ€™s always interesting to see if they have different responses.Â  If you havenâ€™t been told this already, be proactive and ask. It shows respect for the interviewer's time and that youâ€™re keen to move forward to the next stage.  This is an ancient human brain signal. What was once a sign of â€˜I have no weaponsâ€™ is still intrinsically linked as a sign of trust. If you donâ€™t naturally talk with your hands (like me ðŸ¤Œ), try to keep them visible on the table like so: Countless surveys and industry resources say blue is the best colour to wear to an interview as itâ€™s psychologically connected to being a team player, trustworthiness and confidence.Â  I came across this advice recently and itâ€™s a game changer. If youâ€™re asked about your salary expectations, instead of saying "Iâ€™m currently on $X" or "My expectation is $X", say: "Iâ€™m currently interviewing for roles paying $X".Â A great tip to remove any awkwardness, turning a request into a statement.  Iâ€™ve had people tell me they donâ€™t like to follow up after an interview because they feel like theyâ€™re annoying the person. I promise you will never annoy a hiring manager by following up after an interview. Unless youâ€™re doing it every dayâ€¦ You can also use the follow-up as an opportunity to ask any additional questions. A same-day follow-up is ideal, so donâ€™t leave it too long to ponder.Â  If you REALLY want to leave a lasting impression, Iâ€™ve been known to send thank-you beers, office plants, or flowers (noting certain industries or companies may not be able to accept gifts).  It really depends on where you are in the interview process, how competitive the field is, your relationship with the interviewer, and how much you want the gig. If you really want it, pull out all the stops.  Senior Content Writer Another really interesting read. I never knew the colour blue was related to trustworthiness!
