With millions of songs and podcasts available on Spotify, it can be overwhelming to find new music that aligns with your taste. Luckily, there are several methods to try out to discover more music you’ll love on Spotify. Here are some tips to improve your experience on the platform. 1. Utilize Discover Weekly and Daily Mix Spotify curates personalized playlists every Monday and updates them based on your listening patterns. Discover Weekly is a playlist of new tracks you may enjoy but have yet to listen to. Daily Mix is a set of genre-specific playlists that contains songs you’ve played before mixed with new tracks. These playlists update automatically to give you fresh recommendations regularly. 2. Follow Artists and Friends By following your favorite artists, you can stay up-to-date with their new releases, collaborations, and tours. You can also browse through their public playlists and discover other artists they’re listening to. Following your friends on Spotify can give you an insight into their taste in music, and you can listen to their playlists to get exposed to new songs and genres. 3. Use Spotify Radio The Spotify radio feature plays songs similar to the ones you choose. By selecting a song, artist, or playlist, you can start a radio station based on that track or artist. As you listen, you can give feedback by skipping or liking songs to help personalize the station further. 4. Browse Through Curated Playlists Spotify has numerous playlists that cater to different moods, genres, and themes. You can browse through playlists like “Today’s Top Hits,” “Indie Vibes,” “Chill Hits,” or “New Music Friday,” to discover new tracks and artists. You can also filter the playlists based on your mood or activity, such as “Workout,” “Study,” or “Sleep.” 5. Explore the “Fans Also Like” Section When you open an artist’s page on Spotify, you’ll see a section titled “Fans Also Like.” This feature provides a list of similar artists based on the one you’re exploring. By diving into this section, you can find new artists and genres that you may love. 6. Use Spotify’s Search and Browse Features Spotify’s search and browse features provide access to its vast library of music. You can search for an artist, song, album, or playlist and explore their discography. By using the browse feature, you can delve into different genres, moods, and playlists. You can also find podcasts and audiobooks to explore new topics and interests. In conclusion, Spotify offers several methods for finding more music you’ll love. Whether you use the personalized playlists, browse through curated lists, or utilize the search feature, there’s something for everyone on the platform. By trying out these methods, you can expand your musical horizons and discover new artists and genres that align with your taste.
