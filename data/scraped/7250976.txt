Sonam Kapoor's birthday note for her husband Anand Ahuja on his 40th birthday is pure love. The actress, who never shies away from expressing her affection towards her family, did nothing different on her husband's big day. The mother of a baby boy, Sonam Kapoor picked a series of pictures featuring the adorable duo to mark the day. In some images, we see Anand Ahuja being a hands-on dad for Vayu while others feature Sonam Kapoor and the birthday boy sharing a wholesome kiss. Sonam Kapoor wrote a wholesome caption, praising Anand for working hard to be "the best version of himself." The caption read, "Dear Anand, a year around the sun again, this time with our beautiful boy. We love you the most in the world, you kind, sensitive wonderful man. Everyone realizes how special you are but no one knows how hard you work to be the best version of yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. Fly high and reach for the stars @anandahuja . Life is just going to better and better because you deserve everything and more."  Take a look at the adorable post: A post shared by Sonam Kapoor Ahuja (@sonamkapoor) While poured in from all quarters, Sonam Kapoor's cousin Arjun Kapoor also wished Anand Ahuja with a sweet wish. Sharing a picture of Sonam, Anand and Vayu, he wrote, "Happy birthdayÂ brother. Makes me feel so happy seeing Sonam Kapoor, you and Vayu living such a wholesome, well-rounded life... Have your best year ever my man." See Arjun Kapoor's post for Anand Ahuja: A few days back, Sonam Kapoor flew out to London on a summer retreat with her husband, son and sister Rhea Kapoor.
