WEATHER ALERT Jonathan Kegges, Meteorologist Published: February 25, 2023 at 4:39 AM Updated: February 25, 2023 at 8:13 AM Jonathan Kegges, Meteorologist ORLANDO, Fla. – Rinse, wash and repeat. After thick fog in spots early, highs will surge back into the upper 80s Saturday afternoon. Like the past few days, sunshine will be dominant early with a few heating-of-the-day clouds bubbling up through the afternoon. Highs will be in the mid-to-upper 80s again Sunday. The hot and dry stretch looks to continue for much of the week ahead. Highs most days will be in record territory with extremely limited rain chances.  A cold front finally looks to cross the region Friday into Saturday, but temperatures will only drop to average at best. Average high temperatures for late February are in the mid-70s. Even with that front late in the week, rain chances look low at this point. Get today’s headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily: Copyright 2023 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.
