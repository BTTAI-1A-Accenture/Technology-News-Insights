The original story is below. For nearly two weeks, a Hampton man has been unable to access his money because of an update the Green Dot Corporation is conducting.  Robert Vertrees has had his Green Dot prepaid Visa card for years. He loads most of his money onto the card each month to pay bills and cover his gas and small day-to-day expenses, but he's never been denied access for this long. "They've got $837.94 of my money locked up," Vertrees said. "I can't get it, and that's all I've got." To get by, Vertrees is leaning on the support of his grandchildren. He is also finding small ways, like recycling soda cans, to scrape enough cash together to travel to his chemotherapy appointments and continue treating his stage 4 cancer. Vertrees said he has called more than a dozen times, sometimes waiting for hours, without a real resolution to the problem. But, for the sake of his health, he can't continue fighting on the phone.  "I can't worry about it no more. I have to worry about my chemo now," Vertrees said. Green Dot says his access was down for several days, not weeks. The company apologized for the frustration it caused and said it is investigating his case further to improve their service. Green Dot says it gave Vertrees a courtesy credit.
