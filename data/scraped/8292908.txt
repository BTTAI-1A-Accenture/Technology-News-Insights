 Homeowners insurance is defined as a contract between a homeowner and an insurance company, stating that in exchange for your premiums, the insurer will reimburse you for damages or loss caused by covered problems, up to the limits in your policy.   Home insurance also includes coverage for additional living expenses, liability and medical payments to others.  A standard home insurance policy works by reimbursing policyholders for covered claims. The exact way home insurance works depends on the type of claim you make.   Here’s how home insurance works when it comes to your property:  Here’s how home insurance works when it comes to your liability: There are eight types of home insurance policies, depending on your coverage needs. The most common, an HO-3 home insurance policy, provides suitable financial protection for most homeowners. It includes the following six coverages. A standard home insurance policy insures the structure of your house and detached structures against all types of damage, except those listed as exclusions in your policy, such as flooding and earthquakes.  When it comes to your personal property, a standard home insurance policy only pays out for claims if your belongings are damaged by one of the 16 named problems, or perils, in your policy. This includes damage due to fire, lightning, windstorms, snowstorms, home break-ins and more. Tip: Your personal property is usually insured at its actual cash value, meaning depreciation is factored into the claim payout. Upgrade to replacement cost coverage if you want to be reimbursed at today’s prices for your belongings. Learn more: What home insurance covers A standard home insurance policy will not pay to repair or rebuild your property if it is damaged by any of the below problems.  Expert tip: You can purchase additional policies or coverage — like flood insurance, earthquake insurance or water backup coverage — to make sure you’re covered in the event of an excluded problem. Explore coverage for appliances and home systems: What is a home warranty?  By completing a few steps, you can find a homeowners insurance policy that matches your budget and coverage needs. Insurance companies ask for specific information when you request a quote. This can include: A deductible is the amount subtracted from your claim payout. If you file an approved claim for $10,000 and your deductible is $1,000, you’ll receive $9,000 from your insurance company. The higher your deductible, the cheaper your home insurance will be, but the less you’ll receive in a claim reimbursement.  It’s important to compare several home insurance quotes to ensure you’re not missing out on a better deal for the same level of coverage.  But don’t only look at the price. You should also compare insurers’ financial ratings, claims service and customer service ratings and available discounts. Shopping for homeowners insurance? Start here: The best home insurance companies No federal or state law requires homeowners to insure their properties. If you plan to borrow money to pay for your home, however, your lender will almost certainly require insurance as a way to protect its investment. Even if you purchase your home in cash or pay off your mortgage, dropping homeowners insurance is a risky move that leaves you financially exposed. How much home insurance you need depends largely on the rebuild cost of your house. You’ll also want to consider the value of your belongings and the total value of your assets, to protect yourself financially in the event of a liability lawsuit. Also consider if you need additional coverage for problems not covered by home insurance, like flooding.  There are eight types of homeowners insurance, each with different levels of coverage. The HO-3 policy is the most common form of home insurance, designed for standard, single-story houses. An HO-4 is a renters insurance policy and an HO-6 is for condo owners.  Typically, no. The IRS does not allow for homeowners insurance premium deductions on tax documents for your primary home, with few exceptions.  If you own a business and use a portion of your house to conduct work, you may qualify for a home office deduction. This allows you to deduct a percentage of your home insurance premium, based on the square footage of your home office.  There are three — sometimes four — main levels of home insurance coverage: Actual cash value, replacement cost and extended replacement cost. Some insurers also offer guaranteed replacement cost coverage.  Here’s how each level of coverage works when you file a covered home insurance claim.
