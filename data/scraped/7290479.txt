WEA Member Benefits has partnered with Haven Life to make Haven Life's term life insurance policies available to those employed at PK-12 public schools nationwide. MADISON, Wis. (PRWEB) December 14, 2022   WEA Member Benefits, the Wisconsin-based company that provides personal insurance and retirement and investment programs to promote the financial well-being of public school employees and their families, has partnered with Haven Life to make Haven Life's term life insurance policies available to those employed at PK-12 public schools nationwide. Haven Life is a customer-centric digital life insurance agency backed and wholly owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual, AM Best rating of A++). The partnership is supported by the addition of Haven Simple and Haven Term policies to Associates of Clifton Park's (AoCP) portfolio of insurance offerings. AoCP is a national leader in matching people with insurance coverage and provides access to licensed agents to help them find the right policy for their needs. As a result of the partnership, PK-12 public school employees and their families can purchase a low-cost Haven Simple policy via an easy, online application process through the website at weabenefits.com/haven, or with help from the agents at Associates of Clifton Park. Applicants just provide general information about their health to receive a quote.  Haven Simple never requires a medical exam, provides coverage up to $500,000 and you receive a decision online in minutes.  If you live in NY, DE, ND, or SD (where Haven Simple is not available), you may wish to consider Haven Term, a fully medically underwritten life insurance policy that requires a medical exam. Haven Simple and Haven Term policies provide flexible coverage amounts, customizable term lengths, and other individualized features to help meet the unique financial needs of public school employees.  "Member Benefits was born out of a determination to provide those employed in public schools with trusted financial resources to guide them on their financial journey. Haven Life's financial security, coupled with their affordable rates and easy-to-use-platform, were important factors as we considered a potential partnership," said David Kijek, President and CEO of WEA Member Benefits. "Whether people choose to purchase directly through our website or through the assistance of AoCP's agents, we are thrilled to be able to provide another resource to help public school employees and their families achieve long-term financial security."
