 Despite inpouring favorable macro data, the Federal Reserve is anticipated to continue rate hikes at a slower pace until its 2% inflation target is achieved. With experts expecting a recession in the near term, investors can scoop up quality, inexpensive penny stocks trading under $1, VEON Ltd. (VEON), Gran Tierra Energy (GTE), and GEE Group (JOB) this week. Read on…. The U.S. economy expanded for the fourth quarter of last year at a 2.9% annualized pace, higher than the Dow Jones analysts' estimate of 2.8%, owing to an increase in government and consumer spending, In addition, slowing inflation for the sixth consecutive time in December has raised investor optimism, further enhanced after the Fed's moderated rate hike of 0.25 percentage points. However, recessionary fears remain on the forefront after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled rate hikes to continue until the 2% inflation target rate is achieved. Experts believe such persistent rate hikes could tip the economy into recession. Cam Harvey, a professor at Duke University and the director of research at the investment firm Research Affiliates, said, "There could be many things that we could do to mitigate the actual source of inflation, rather than this blunt instrument that just drives us into recession."
