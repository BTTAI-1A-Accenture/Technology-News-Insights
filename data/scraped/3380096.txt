            Some of the most notable and promising innovations in solar panels and wind turbines for farms are using bifacial solar panels, using floating solar panels, using vertical axis wind turbines, and using hybrid solar-wind systems. Bifacial solar panels are solar panels that can capture and convert sunlight from both sides, and can increase power output and performance by 10% to 30%. Floating solar panels deployed along open canals is another great example of maximising underutilised surfaces. Vertical axis wind turbines can offer some advantages over horizontal axis wind turbines (ie. lower installation and maintenance costs) while hybrid systems optimise both solar and wind sources, which can reduce the variability and intermittency.

            Innovations aimed at reducing the operational noise of VWTs are making them more suitable for farm environments where noise pollution can affect livestock and residential areas. Techniques such as modifying blade shape and using materials that dampen sound have led to quieter turbines. For example, in a VWT model I was involved with, we incorporated aeroacoustic simulations in the design phase to identify and minimize noise-generating features, resulting in a turbine that was significantly quieter than traditional models.

The integration of advanced control systems in VWTs, such as active pitch and yaw control, enhances their ability to adapt to changing wind conditions and optimize energy capture.
