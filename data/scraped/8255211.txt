  Language learning marketplace Preply has revealed a list of seven words that viewers might need to know before they tune in – here’s what they mean.
 
Star Baker: This is one of the easier terms to remember and it's two words every baker wants to hear. It refers to the best baker of the week.
 
Soggy bottom: This, however, is not something a baker wants to come across if they can help it. A soggy bottom occurs when a cake hasn’t been cooked properly – it has a raw centre and therefore a soggy base.
 

 
Crème pat: This phrase is a shortened version of Crème Patissière which is a rich custard made from flour, egg yolk and sugar and is used in pastries and tarts. It’s important the bakers avoid a lumpy crème pat when it comes to making the sweet treat.
 
The Gingham Altar: This term isn’t widely known but it’s the name of the table where the bakers carry their technical and showstopper bakes to for Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith to judge them. The bakers will be aiming to make it to the Gingham Altar without dropping their creations.
 
The Hollywood Handshake: Every Bake Off fan will know this one. Paul Hollywood gives a handshake to bakers who have really impressed him.
 
Even bake: This means the bake is perfect and has been cooked for the right amount of time.
 
Proving: When the bakers are tasked with making bread, the dough must be proved to allow it to rise before going in the oven. But bakers need to avoid over-proving it.
 



 
  Amy Pritchett, Student Success Manager from Preply, has shared five tips to help viewers become a Bake Off pro.
 
  She said breaking up the syllables of the words will help viewers say the terminology they hear on Bake Off and viewers can also look out for particular sounds that are specific to the word’s native language, for example, the ‘è’ in Patissière.
 
  Amy suggested using Google to search how to pronounce words that viewers come across on the show or she said using TikTok or YouTube can also help with pronunciation.
 
The Great British Bake Off returns on Tuesday, September 26 at 8pm on Channel 4.
