SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Comparing Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Netflix isn't the only company cracking down on sharing. Costco, which is the "largest wholesale club in the U.S. by location" and that requires an annual membership to shop at, "is now asking to see photo identification along with customers' membership cards at its self-checkout registers," The Wall Street Journal reported. Costco said in a statement that it's noticed an uptick in non-members using other members' cards at self-checkout, and it doesn't "feel it's right that nonmembers receive the same benefits and pricing as our members." But what exactly are those perks, and are they worth paying an annual fee for? Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

We take a look at the three big warehouse club memberships to see where it makes the most sense to pay to shop. If you're interested in buying your groceries and household products in bulk, there are three main warehouse clubs you can turn to: Costco, BJ's, and Sam's Club. We dive into how the three compare when it comes to membership costs, accessibility, and store offerings. Of course, a plethora of stores and an affordable membership only go so far if you can't get what you want from the warehouse club. Here's an overview of what the three stores offer: Ultimately, it depends on what you're looking for. A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com BJ's clearly "doesn't offer all the benefits of Costco or Sam's Club," Insider said, but it could still "be a happy medium for most people, selling food in quantities that can be easily stored without taking over your entire home." When it comes to Costco vs. Sam's Club, Sam's Club has the less costly annual membership fee, but Costco has the edge when it comes to "better prices on more grocery staples," according to an Insider price comparison. Meanwhile, "Sam's Club carries more brand-name products," U.S. News & World Report noted, whereas Costco stands out for its Top Tier gas and its "impressive selection of organic products." But at the end of the day, "all three wholesalers are likely to offer you solid value for your money," CNBC Select said.
