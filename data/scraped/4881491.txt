Clean TeQ Water (CNQ) has signed a $10 million contract for the Townsville Water Treatment Facility project in Queensland. The company signed the contract with local civil partner A. Gabrielli Construction (AGC) to deliver a recycled water treatment facility at the Townsville City Council’s (TCC) Cleveland Bay Purification Plant.  The facility will produce up to 15 megalitres of water per day for industrial and irrigation users. AGC is the head contractor of the project and is responsible for the integrated design and construction of the recycled water treatment facility, including all civil and infrastructure works.  Clean TeQ Water will be responsible for the design and construction of the specified water treatment process and equipment to produce the ‘Class A’ water. Under the contract, the company may increase the plant’s capacity to 20 megalitres of water per day and upgrade the treatment technology to reach a higher quality of water for reuse. “Clean TeQ Water is delighted to sign this contract and to continue our work with AGC to deliver this advanced water treatment and recycling plant, a central pillar for the future water security of the region,” CNQ CEO Willem Vriesendorp said. “We hope other regions will follow the Townsville example to treat and recycle municipal effluent instead of disposing to the environment.” Clean TeQ expects to deliver the contract works in the third quarter of next year, and the facility is targeted to be operational by the end of 2023. Company shares were up 3.95 per cent to 39.5 cents at 3:09 pm AEDT.
