The fish are biting − but are you licensed to catch them? Go Outdoors Florida, an online licensing system for anglers and hunters, offers a quick and easy way to prepare for your next fishing or hunting trip. Here's how it works. It's the official licensing site of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. It offers recreation hunting and fishing licenses, captive wildlife permits and harvest reporting. Florida residents and nonresidents can purchase permits, but pricing may be different. If you haven’t already, create an account with the FWC to begin the application on Go Outdoors Florida. Once you’re logged into your account, click on “Recreational Licenses” tab. There, you’ll select, “Click here to get a license.” Voila! You’ll see dozens of hunting licenses to select from.

This includes catch-and-release fishing. "A license is required to attempt to take fish," FWC said on its website. "If you cast a line or catch and release, you need a fishing license." Keep up to date with hunting zones and dates on the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission site. Make sure to check if there's designated dates for each animal, large and small, and possession limit for each license.
