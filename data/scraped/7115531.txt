 An automatic dialer is an electronic device or software system that calls customer telephone numbers automatically from a database of leads. It has the ability to target customers and connect them to an agent or an interactive voice response (IVR). You’ll no longer spend a tremendous amount of time searching through a contact database or dialing numbers manually. Auto dialers are designed to help companies increase productivity by making a larger volume of calls without hiring new agents. There are three types of outbound dialers: Auto dialers are ideal for time-sensitive situations where you need things done super-fast but that is just one of its many benefits. It is an effective tool to actively support call center teams, helping them ease their workload and achieve greater success. Let’s look at some of the key benefits of implementing auto dialer software: Featured Partners 1 RingCentral $20 per user, per month (paid annually) Yes Yes 1 RingCentral On RingCentral's Website 2 Nextiva $18.95 per user, per month Yes Yes 2 Nextiva On Nextiva's Website If you are looking for a way to simplify your call center and increase productivity, using an auto dialer may be a solution for you. There are many types of auto dialers on the market, each with an array of features so it is important to choose a program that is right for you. This will depend entirely on the needs of your call center. Let’s look at some key points to consider when choosing an auto dialer: The price of an auto dialer all depends on the company needs. Some companies will pay between $300 to $10,000 and more, depending on how many channels are required. The price also varies according to how many calls are being made at once. If you are an enterprise with multiple channels the price also increases. Auto dialing services offer a variety of pricing packages and are custom priced according to the company’s needs. Most plans are per user, per month with additional costs based on features and services, add-ons or pay-per-minute and pay-per-seat pricing methods. If you have basic needs and you have a cellphone and Wi-Fi, there are free services available, such as Google Voice. Fortunately, the dialing system is simple to use and set up. To get started you will need the essentials: Auto dialer software, computer, active telephone line and voice modem or VoIP. Generally, auto dialing systems work in four parts: Most auto dialers come with a plethora of features and functionalities and many call centers benefit greatly from such sophisticated tools. Let’s look at just some of the most common and valuable features and functionalities of an auto dialer: To determine the best auto dialers for small businesses, Forbes Advisor researched providers in the space and narrowed it down to the 14 top providers. We analyzed these across five primary categories for a total of 27 different metrics. The criteria were then weighted to favor features that matter most to small businesses. The best auto dialers on our list had the best overall scores based on our methodology. Here’s what we took into consideration while ranking each category: Some users may be looking for the best deal around for the most basic auto dialing services, such as voice calling, internet fax, free local and toll-free numbers, but some are willing to pay more for robust features and capabilities, value for money, additional add-ons and ease of use. We chose the best auto dialers that accommodate all sizes of businesses from small to enterprise offering affordable pricing, moderate pricing and custom pricing. This category makes up 10% of the overall score. Features make a product and users know the right features will boost productivity as well as create an overall experience, delivering value and functionality to the user. We looked for features based on the services each auto dialer provider had to offer. For example, software integrations, dialing capabilities, list filtering, unanswered number detection and collaboration tools. This made up 30% of the overall score. Additional features help to set one product apart from the other. Some additional features come as an add-on while others might be included in the plan, making the service provider more appealing. Some additional features include contact list and time zone management, call transfer options, speed customization, message broadcasting and call monitoring. Our rating score was determined by which features were included, not included or add-ons. Additional features made up 20% of the overall score. An important product feature includes ratings and reviews. Customers are more likely to make a purchase when the product has user reviews, even with a balance of both good and bad. Reviews are weighted between ease of use, functionality, customer service, app ratings and UX. This category makes up 10% of the overall score. In addition to the categories above, we also included our own first-hand expert score to account for qualitative factors that require first-hand experience to gauge. For example, this metric considers the quality of each auto dialer’s features, the value for price, ease of use, support quality and popularity. This accounts for 30% of the overall score. Automatic dialing software is legal but the call center must abide by the rules and regulations under the TCPA. Auto dialer software is ideal for call center teams to helping them ease workload and improve customer experience (CX). This can be achieved by expediting outbound productivity,
improved customer engagement, improving sales, decreasing idle time and providing TCPA compliance. If you have a Wi-Fi connection you can still make and receive calls with your service even if you have little to no cellular coverage. If you are looking to make multiple simultaneous calls, the predictive dialer can average a daily capacity of 100 to 900 contacts with about 100 to 250 calls per agent. Sometimes, contact centers employ hundreds or thousands of employees, many of whom work part time, making it challenging for contact center managers to plan schedules and assign shifts without making errors or spending too much time. Thus, you need to find a way to resolve customer issues. Contact center workforce management software platforms can help you with the necessary forecasting, scheduling, agent assignment and management of intraday activities.
