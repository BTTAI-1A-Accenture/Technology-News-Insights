VAST Data, the data platform company for the AI era, today announced that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) has incorporated VAST Data's leading file software platform into the new HPE GreenLake for File Storage service. By leveraging VAST's unique and innovative scale-out software architecture for the new HPE GreenLake for File Storage, enterprise customers can manage unstructured data with high performance at scale to deliver superior time to data insight.

 
"Media creation is on the rise, across enterprise, commercial and consumer use cases. As a result, unstructured data storage is becoming increasingly necessary and increasingly complex for organizations ranging from life sciences to media/entertainment and financial services," said Tom Black, executive vice president and general manager, HPE Storage. "By using VAST Data software within HPE GreenLake for File Storage, we are able to deliver a scale-out file service, designed to accelerate data-intensive workloads, which can be managed via the HPE GreenLake platform."

 
The new HPE GreenLake for File Storage uses VAST's Disaggregated, Shared-Everything (DASE) architecture, which IDC describes as "the storage architecture of the future." Built on HPE Alletra Storage MP and delivered as part of the HPE GreenLake cloud operational model, the new HPE data service enables enterprises to run their unstructured data workloads efficiently from one control plane. From enterprise to AI applications, the VAST software allows customers to quickly analyze all data in context and in the moment by consolidating infrastructure to accelerate training and inference time.

 
"By combining VAST Data's next-generation architecture with trusted hybrid cloud infrastructure and data services from HPE, customers now get the best of all worlds combined into a single, simple to consume solution from HPE," said Renen Hallak, Co-Founder and CEO of VAST Data. "VAST is laying the foundation for the future of data management and AI workloads, and together with HPE, we're continuing to innovate for the enterprise, where data is at the center of every application strategy and business decision."
