 OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that enables the extraction of text and characters from scanned documents, images, or other sources of textual information. It involves the conversion of printed or handwritten text into machine-readable and editable formats. OCR plays a vital role in various applications such as document digitization, text recognition, data extraction, and automated data entry. Today 3 OCR models will be introduced. These are: -     Keras OCR -     East -     Tesseract These three models will be tested on this book cover.  1. OCR DIFFICULTIES But before the OCR process, let's discuss some OCR problems. When OCR engines run, engines must deal with some difficulties. These major difficulties can be grouped into 4 categories:    2. OCR ENGINES COMPARE RESULTS First, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will use the "time" library to measure the OCR engine running speed. Because the East Algorithm doesn't have a private library, we will import it with OpenCV.dnn module. You can find the weights of East libraries from this link. We need to read our sample book cover which showed above. 2.1. KERAS OCR Our first algorithm is Keras OCR. Keras OCR is built on top of Keras and TensorFlow. It provides a framework for training and deploying OCR models using deep learning techniques. Keras OCR provides out-of-the-box OCR models and an end-to-end training pipeline to build new OCR models. 2.2. EAST Our second algorithm is East. East (Efficient and Accurate Scene Text) is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) method specifically designed for detecting and recognizing text in natural scene images. It was introduced in the paper titled "EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector" by Xinyu Zhou, Cong Yao, He Wen, Yuzhi Wang, Shuchang Zhou, Weiran He, and Jiajun Liang in 2017. In East, the picture sizes must be divided by 32, otherwise, you will get an error. The East OCR method has gained popularity due to its efficiency, accuracy, and ability to handle text of various orientations and aspect ratios. 2.3. TESSERACT Tesseract OCR is an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It is widely used for extracting text from images, scanned documents, and other sources. Before using Tesseract OCR you must download and install the Tesseract engine. (32 bit or 64bit) 3. CONCLUSIONS The running speeds of the algorithms for the selected book are as follows: KERAS text detection took 4.807 seconds EAST text detection took 0.319 seconds TESSERACT text detection took 0.234 seconds East and Tesseract gave fast results. But Keras, due to the pipeline system runs slower. But Keras give more accurate results. Also, Keras gives more solutions for visualizations. In general:  ·        It seems that Tesseract is not very good at detecting text in the entire image. Instead, the text should be detected first with text detection and the texts have to be given OCR engines. ·        But Tesseract is performing well for high-resolution images. Certain morphological operations such as dilation, erosion, and OTSU binarization can help increase pytesseract performance. ·        While Keras OCR is good in terms of accuracy but it is costly in terms of time. Also if you’re using CPU, time might be an issue for you. Keras OCR is image specific OCR tool. If text is inside the image and the fonts and colors are unorganized. ·        East OCR is a lightweight model which is giving a good performance for receipt or PDF conversion. It is giving more accurate results with organized texts like PDF files, receipts, and bills. East OCR also performs well on noisy images. ·        All these results can be further improved by performing specific image operations. OCR Prediction depends not only on the model but also on many other factors like clarity, the grey scale of the image, hyperparameter, weightage given, etc.  4. ACCURACY METRICS OF OCR OCR metrics are used to evaluate the performance of an OCR system in terms of accuracy and quality. Here are some common metrics used for measuring OCR performance: Character Error Rate (CER): Character Error Rate measures the percentage of incorrect characters in the OCR output compared to the ground truth text. It considers changes, adding, and subtractions of characters. CER provides a detailed assessment of character-level accuracy in OCR. One industrial problem that was solved with the CER metric is shown below. Precision, Recall, and F1-score: Precision, Recall, and F1-score are metrics commonly used in text recognition tasks, including OCR. Precision measures the ratio of correctly recognized characters or words to the total number of recognized characters or words. Recall measures the ratio of correctly recognized characters or words to the total number of ground truth characters or words. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of OCR performance. CEO da Empresa Tivia Soluções Inteligentes Keras is a good option if you use GPU, can improve a lot the results.
