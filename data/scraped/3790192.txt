 Welcome back, alwaysAI Insiders!  I recently returned from some much-needed PTO. Along with visiting lots of family and getting my yearly fill of the East Coast, I had time to think and recharge. The luxury of it was not lost on me. One full week off the alwaysAI clock. 168 hours. The exact amount of hours in this week and will be in the next.  I answered a lot of questions about what I do and what alwaysAI does.  What I do is try to convey in words, what alwaysAI does. I knew that explaining how computer vision uses AI to help companies see into their operations using existing cameras, would require some follow-up explanations. But I was surprised by how neatly responses filtered into three categories. People who heard AI and were over the hype. People who heard AI and immediately wanted to discuss the end of humanity. People who heard AI and were thoroughly confused in spite of (or because of?) the current news frenzy around technology.  No, alwaysAI does not generate new content. No, our software does not hallucinate. We do not do anything with chatbots and cannot serve as your life coach. But yes, we provide practical solutions for any industry looking for real-time data. We track objects, people, and events in stores, warehouses, factory floors, and restaurants. Wherever business happens, we provide real-time visual data as it happens. Our technology can automate tasks like defect detection or occupancy counting. We can tell you exactly how long a certain process takes. We are an extra set of eyes looking at whatever is most important to your business. Yes, AI is extraordinary. It can do extraordinary things. But as I took in one last sunset 🏜️, with a cold drink in hand 🍹, I was reminded of the one thing no AI will ever be able to do: generate more hours in a day. ⏳ Now I’m back and have a chance to reflect further.  I didn’t need more time (did I mention we were with A LOT of family?) 168 hours a week is enough. I just needed to reconsider how I spend those hours. That’s what alwaysAI does. 💡 alwaysAI provides businesses with a visual audit of their operations. We allow businesses to practically, accurately, and precisely evaluate processes to make the best use of their resources. With unprecedented, real-time visual insights businesses can see exactly when, where, and how critical operations perform.  Computer vision is not generative. It’s not virtual. It’s practical AI, shining a light on reality. alwaysAI is helping businesses do more within the confines of finite time and resources. 💻👁️ How can alwaysAI computer vision solutions help you streamline operations, improve productivity, and drive more revenue so you get the most out of your 168 hours?  alwaysAI Insights 6 Reasons Why Your Retail Business Needs to Invest in Computer Vision “Technology — specifically edge computing — provides the foundation for a better customer experience, real-time inventory management, enhanced security and loss prevention and in-store analytics.” For more on how edge computing – specifically computer vision – is driving the future of retail, click here. Industry Roundup AI Can't Build a High-Rise, but It Can Speed Up the Job Sarah Liu, a partner at Fifth Wall, a venture capital firm focused on real estate investments says, “The best companies aren’t touting themselves as A.I. companies…They’re touting themselves as problem-solving companies.” We couldn’t agree more. Industries, especially like construction, manufacturing, retail and restaurants, lack visual insights into their operations. Computer vision delivers, helping enterprises to evaluate and audit processes to better allocate resources, improve productivity and drive more revenue. Learn more about how construction is leveraging practical AI solutions. 👷🏗️ All Hail Retail People still like to spend their time shopping – in person! Not only are retail sales up, but shopping malls are back. 🛍️ CNN reports, “The mall as a retail concept is alive and well, with retailers pivoting to fit the demands of a digital age. Rather than jostling with brick-and-mortar stores for supremacy, each shopping format is bolstering the other.”  Computer vision offers a valuable solution for retailers looking to bridge the gap between online and in-person shopping. Just as online shopping sites can use cookies to track and monitor online shopping behavior, computer vision provides retailers with the ability to track and monitor customers in real-time. This immediate, visual data is critical for understanding customer behavior and maximizing their brick and mortar shopping experience. Discover more.
