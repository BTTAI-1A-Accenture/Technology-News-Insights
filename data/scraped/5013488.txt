As per US Energy Information Administration, the US was categorised as the world’s top crude oil producer in 2018 and it maintained this position through 2021. U.S. oil refineries continue to obtain crude oil produced in the US and in other countries. There are different companies providing crude oil to the world market. In 2021, out of total U.S. crude oil production, Texas made a contribution of approximately 42.4%, while New Mexico and North Dakota made up approximately 11.1% and 9.9%, respectively. Research by US Energy Information Administration shows that despite total U.S. crude oil production falling between 1985 and 2008, its annual production saw an improvement nearly every year from 2009 through 2019. An increase in production, primarily in the states of Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado, was brought about by the implementation of more advanced drilling techniques. However, crude oil production in the US saw a downfall in 2020 and 2021 principally due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Council on Foreign Relations highlighted that the US produces approximately 75% of its crude oil supply and 90% of its natural gas supply domestically. By the end of 2021, the country was producing around 100 billion cubic feet of gas per day and around 11 million barrels of crude oil per day. The US Energy Information Administration estimates that without major policy changes, U.S. oil and gas production should remain high through 2050. This estimate remains stable even after considering the warnings from climate scientists and international agreements promoting an immediate transition to renewable energy sources. In the latest December issue Short-Term Energy Outlook, EIA expects global oil inventories to decline 200,000 b/d in H1 2023 before they rise by approximately 700,000 b/d in H2 2023. U.S. oil and gas industry is made up of several companies. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are considered as the biggest U.S.-based oil firms. Elsewhere, UK–based BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) have dominant position in the US. International Energy Agency (IEA), in their December issue oil market report, highlighted that global oil demand might contract by 110,000 b/d year-on-year in Q4 2022, touching 100.8 million b/d. This is up by 130,000 b/d against the agency’s report for November 2022. Strong gasoil use in main consuming countries surpasses weak European and Asian petrochemical deliveries. Despite seasonal slowdown in world oil demand and global challenges, recent oil consumption data exhibits optimism. This was mainly apparent in non-OECD regions, such as China, India and Middle East. As per IEA forecasts, oil demand should rise by 2.3 mb/d in 2022 and a further 1.7 mb/d next year. Goldman Sachs’ Jeffrey Currie is quite optimistic about the outlook for commodities in 2023 principally due to recent trends being seen in China. Apart from this, he believes that the rebounding of PMIs in Europe and India should also lend support. China, which is the largest commodity consumer and largest oil importer in the world, is expected to lead the demand growth through much of 2023.
