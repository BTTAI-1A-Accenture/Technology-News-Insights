Reviewed Updated: Mar 24, 2024, 4:50pm Cloud ERP software is an enterprise resource planning platform that’s hosted online, so there’s no need to install it on in-house servers, as is traditionally the case. It’s meant to help businesses run all departments, from accounting and human resources (HR) to sales and manufacturing. Traditional ERP software was typically out of reach for small to midsize businesses (SMBs) because it was expensive and difficult to implement. Now cloud ERP software provides customer relationship management (CRM) and business intelligence (BI) features at an affordable price. Here are our top choices for 2024. The Forbes Advisor Small Business team is committed to bringing you unbiased rankings and information with full editorial independence. We use product data, strategic methodologies and expert insights to inform all of our content to guide you in making the best decisions for your business journey. To find the best cloud ERP software for small businesses, we considered over 25 of the leading providers in the space and narrowed it down to 16, which we then evaluated across five key categories and 25 different metrics. Our ratings consider factors such as transparent pricing, employee self-sufficiency, compatibility with third-party integrations, access to customer support and ratings.

 The cloud ERP software from QT9 is made specifically for manufacturers, retailers and distributors. Its features focus on automation and real-time reporting and the company even offers a quality management system (QMS) separate from the QT9 ERP. Features: Although most cloud ERP software is meant to combine multiple business processes, they often separate modules and make you pay for some as add-ons, but not QT9. You pay one price for all 18 modules, including MRP, sales management, inventory control and purchasing, to name a few. The features included in QT9’s ERP focus on automating tasks for accounting, data integration across modules, job scheduling and email reminders. You can set up auto reorders and auto allocation in your inventory based on suppliers’ estimates and your own sales. All reports are in real time, so you can get an accurate view of your shipping, purchasing, manufacturing and accounting departments. Pricing: To get the most accurate pricing, you should contact the QT9 sales department directly for a quote. We’ve seen starting costs at around $1,500 per year, but it isn’t clear if that’s for cloud ERP software or for an on-premises solution. Nor is there a per-user cost published publicly. Learn more: Read our QT9 review. Who should use it: Retailers and production companies would do well with QT9 for tracking inventory, goods and ensuring quality control.

 Cloud ERP software is considered software as a service (SaaS), which combines a variety of tools to help businesses manage resources. It’s hosted by a company that allows paid users to connect to the service online via a browser or an app. Usually the services provide management of finances, inventory, supply chain, sales and analytics. Some also include HR and project management features. Traditional on-premises ERP software is often far out of reach for small business budgets because the upfront cost of installation, hardware and implementation is so pricey. With cloud ERP software, you tend to pay a monthly price based on the number of users and types of modules your business needs. Additionally, cloud ERP software tends to include monthly maintenance and updates without you having to pay extra or deal with interruptions to your platform. It’s also  more scalable because you can add more users or resources as needed. There are multiple benefits of choosing cloud ERP software and not just choosing it over traditional ERP software. Finding a cloud ERP system in the early stages of your business can set you up for success. It can help you organize your entire business operations from the beginning. Even if you’ve been in business for a while and you’re just now finding the need for cloud ERP software, you can reap several benefits of making the move, such as an increase in productivity, better visibility of your data and you could reduce the number of apps your business uses now: When you’re ready to choose cloud ERP software for your business, it’s important to take into consideration what your business needs. There are essential features, such as inventory and financial management, but there are also bonuses that may make or break your decision, such as ease of use or integrations available. Consider the features of each cloud ERP software you’re looking into, but also look at what each one specializes in and how it can help your business. Some cloud ERP software are better for manufacturers, while others may offer tools vital for e-commerce businesses. Below are what Forbes Advisor suggests as must-have features and the key factors you should consider before signing on any dotted line. You can find some cloud ERP software that offers features for every vertical in your company, but not all do. Some are better suited for manufacturers and don’t include features needed by retailers or e-commerce businesses, for example. Be sure to consider the departments you have in your company and what features are most important to each. Generally, ERP software is complex because there’s so much you can do with it. You should consider how easy it is to use for all users. Cloud ERP software can come with a steep learning curve, especially for those who are less tech-savvy. Look for software that’s customizable with zero or low code, that has easy-to-understand guides and training for users. Implementation is something that’s usually considered for traditional ERP software because it requires more help. Cloud ERP software is far easier, but you may want to consider asking your provider for help in setting up workflow automations, custom reports and settings you need for your business. Implementation is just one part of overall support. Most cloud ERP software offer 24/7 support via one or more common channels, including phone, email, live chat or a ticketing system. Look for help documentation that can be accessed via the platform and paid training for your staff. Cloud ERP software is more affordable than on-premises solutions, but it’s still fairly expensive. Most providers charge a monthly per-user fee. You can find some that offer a flat fee for unlimited users, but it’s rare to see this pricing structure. Keep in mind that you may need to pay for support, implementation and customization help. There could also be hidden maintenance fees or resource fees, given that your provider will be hosting the platform on its servers. If you have software that you want to keep using for your business, it’s important that you note which ones are must-haves to cross-reference with a cloud ERP software’s list of integrations. Alternatively, you may have access to an open API, which would allow you to connect any software you have to your cloud ERP software, but this may require some dev help. It’s difficult to put an average price on cloud ERP software because there are so many variables and most providers don’t publish pricing publicly. The lack of transparency isn’t convenient, but it’s because most software companies need to provide a custom quote for a custom setup. Our research shows that you should expect to pay anywhere between $70 per user, per month and $150 per user, per month. There are often additional monthly costs for the license, or a base cost, which can run a couple hundred dollars to $1,000 per month. Some cloud ERP software charges a per-user-per-month price for each module it offers, so the cost can go up quickly. Each cloud ERP software works a little differently, but the basic premise is the same. You should have a login to access the platform via a browser or in an app for your desktop, tablet or mobile phone. You’ll have a main dashboard that should show you all the modules or data that’s pertinent to your role. An admin typically sets permissions for each user to show them only the modules they use. For example, those who work in HR will likely have access to company-wide charts and dashboards and the HR management tools. Manufacturing teams may have access to financials, project management and supply chain modules. If you’re an executive, you likely have access to everything, but your dashboard may be set up to mostly show a bird’s-eye view of projects, YTD finances and other high-level information. Navigating cloud ERP software works similarly to other software you likely already use. You can expect a sidebar menu along with a top menu for quickly accessing each module or dashboard. Setting up cloud ERP software is the most time-consuming step and will require a bit of downtime for some teams, or you can usually enlist the help of your provider’s support staff to help with importing data and customizing fields for inventory, warehouse locations, contacts and reports. Forbes Advisor takes an unbiased approach to ranking the best cloud ERP software. We focus on five main criteria broken down into 25 different sub-factors to determine our top picks. The total number of points a perfect product could score is 100, but we translate the scores into our five-star rating. Here’s how we evaluated cloud ERP software: Budget is a big deal, especially to SMBs and SMEs, but it’s difficult to score SaaS such as cloud ERP software because the pricing is tied to the unique needs of each business. We gave more credit to providers that offer a free trial, free plan and publicly publish their pricing. There are specific features and options that every cloud ERP software should include. We looked at warehouse management features, reporting, accounting, real-time updates and software integrations. For the software providers that include these in the base service, we gave the most credit. We still credit those that offer a module as an add-on, but we remove points for those that don’t include at least the basics. We consider some cloud ERP software features as bonuses because you don’t require them to run your business, but they’re nice to have. Automation, CRM features, HR functionality, supply chain management, forecasting and manufacturing features are a handful of the unique features we look for. It’s important to consider what users have to say about these programs, so we turned to third-party review sites and considered comments, ratings and the pros and cons listed by customers. Not only do we consider the actual rating on each site we reference, we read through the reviews to study what the users say and whether issues are resolved by the software company. Finally, we leave room to offer an expert view of each software for the less tangible value of the cloud ERP software options. We consider how easy it is to use each platform, its value for the cost and the standout features or tools it offers. The biggest difference between ERP and cloud ERP is that you host traditional ERP on your business’s servers (on premises), while cloud ERP is hosted via the cloud (online). The benefits of cloud ERP software are that you can access it remotely and it’s more affordable for small businesses. Forbes Advisor named Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, SAP Business One Professional and SYSPRO as the best cloud ERP software because they have low points of entry thanks to their affordability, ease of use and myriad features helpful to small to midsize businesses. Cloud ERP platforms work similarly to other software you likely already use. They’re hosted on the software providers’ servers and paid users from your company use a login to access the software and your data. SAP offers a cloud-based ERP—SAP Business One Professional is a highly customizable ERP solution that we listed as one of our top picks.
