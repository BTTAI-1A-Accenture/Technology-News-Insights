To mark Green Football Weekend, Swansea City Under-18s were joined by head coach Russell Martin for a litter pick in the city centre. The youth players met at Morgans Hotel, part of the Swansea.com group, where they collected litter pickers and black bin bags before splitting into two parties. One group took a route along Wind Street and into Castle Square, while the others made their way around Swansea Marina.  The second group were later joined by head coach Martin after he had concluded first-team training and, in total, the players and staff collected 12 bags of refuse from the streets. Swansea City Under-18s coach Darren Davies, said: "It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience contributing to our community.  "It actually opened our eyes to how much litter is around the area and the players and staff certainly are more aware of our environment, how we can contribute to respecting it, and how we can make Swansea a cleaner and ultimately better place to live in."  General manager of Morgans Hotel, Kate Bowen, added: "We had a great time participating in Swansea City's Green Football Weekend in conjunction with the EFL. "We are proud to have been a part of the club's community participation programme, and loved being able to promote our local sustainability and environment!" © 2024 Swansea City Association Football Club Limited
