 Join Our Telegram channel to stay up to date on breaking news coverage Hedera Network, native coin HBAR, is making waves in the crypto market and projecting a significant surge in potential in the coming weeks.Â The coin is already boasting over 100% in its 24-hour trading volume, while its market value hints at increasing significantly before the weekend. State of @hedera Q2 2023 Despite a bear market and hostile US regulatory regime, Hedera continues to show resilience.  In Q2, Hedera revenue increased 67% QoQ, added its 29th council member, announced an EVM strategy, and saw increases in all Network Services.  ðŸ§µ pic.twitter.com/mRVbUgh2Ke â€” Nick Garcia (@NickDGarcia) July 28, 2023  HBARâ€™s current surge and bullish outlook could be attributed to the increased buying activities in its market and the new social media network, Calaxy, garnering speculations across the crypto community.Â  HBAR will likely become a high-rewarding coin in the crypto market. HBAR price is 12.40% up, trading at $0.07226 in the last 24 hours as of 6:17 am EST. Also, its trading volume has shot up by 102%, recording over $351 million today.Â  While these surges show the increased buying activities across the assetâ€™s market, the technical analysis could hint at what to expect next.  The two consecutive green candle sticks above show the increased buying pressure on HBARâ€™s market in the last two days.Â  This reflects on the Bollinger bands, diverging from each other, showing that HBARâ€™s market condition is overbought and could trigger price correction in the coming days. Also, HBARâ€™s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 76.45, moving in the overbought region (above 70). This shows the increased buying activities in the crypto market, suggesting more rallies ahead of the potential price correction.Â  Since the asset is selling more units within a short period, itâ€™s likely to reach its resistance at $0.07953 faster, thus triggering a consolidation phase on HBARâ€™s price.Â  Despite the potential consequences of this overbought condition, HBAR still has bullish solid momentum, showing its tendency to break above the nearest resistance at $0.07332 before the next 24 hours. The overbought market condition above shows that Hederaâ€™s coin, HBAR, has reached new high prices. Profit-taking investors and traders may decide to sell off their holdings at these high prices, thus, resulting in a price correction and consolidation for the coin. Notwithstanding, HBAR has support at $0.0593 and $0.0694. So, if the consolidation phase pushes the coinâ€™s price down, itâ€™s likely to rebound shortly at its support levels.Â  The excitement and speculation garnered by the new social network, Calaxy, is a factor that could uphold HBARâ€™s surge throughout this week. The Hedera network onboarded a social media app expected to attract a mainstream audience to the network. Before we depart for the weekend, I, on behalf of the @CalaxyApp team, wanted to thank the @hedera community for embracing Calaxy MVP that we released yesterday morning ðŸ¥¹ Itâ€™s been a difficult 3 years and our team worked so hard for this moment but boy was it worth it ðŸ˜± 1/ â€” Solo Ceesay (@SoloCeesay) August 12, 2023  The app helps creators monetize their passions by offering a one-stop hub where they can share unique experiences with their community and turn skills into income. Considering the solutions and objectives of this new social network, traders and investors are developing strong positive sentiments that Hederaâ€™s network will benefit significantly from this integration.Â  The project is that its coin HBAR would be in demand, thus recording dramatic surges in the long run.
