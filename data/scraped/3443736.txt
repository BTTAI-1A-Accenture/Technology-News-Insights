 Riot Games is dropping a large Teamfight Tactics 12.23 B-patch before the holiday break, containing a total of 55 balance changes.  Having released on Dec. 7, TFT Set Eight Monster’s Attack! has showcased a meta full of variance. Outliers like Zed and Viego are getting addressed in the 12.23 B-patch, along with 53 other minor adjustments. No updates will take place for the remainder of 2022, as the Riot team will be on holiday break. The next TFT Set Eight patch is 13.1, scheduled to release on Jan. 11.  Here are the full TFT 12.23 B-patch notes, according to game designer Stephen “Mortdog” Mortimer. The TFT 12.23 B-patch nerfed multiple levers on Viego. Most of the balance changes were minor tweaks, like the nerf to Zed or the buff to Yuumi’s mana. Aurelion Sol had its number of meteors increased, but to compensate for them the dragon’s spell was slightly nerfed.  Similar to the champion balance changes, the Hero Augment adjustments were mostly minor ones.  In conjunction with Camille and Viego nerfs, the attack speed offered through the Ox Force trait was also nerfed. The Heart trait received a nice little AP buff and the Recon trait had its critical chance adjusted.  Warmog’s Armor has been overperforming since the release of TFT Set Eight, resulting in multiple nerfs applied to its various forms. Redemption was also slightly nerfed, along with the Radiant Runaan’s Hurricane.  No major changes were applied to TFT Set Eight Augments. Electrocharge had been overperforming slightly, resulting in a reduction of damage at one, two, and three.
