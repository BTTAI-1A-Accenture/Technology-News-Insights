Most Widely Read Newspaper Kuda Kindly share this story: A fintech company operating in Nigeria and the United Kingdom, Kuda Bank, has launched a multichannel campaign to increase the awareness of cashless payment options in Nigeria.
according to the fintech’s Co-founder, Musty Mustapha, the thematic campaign named ‘Cash Is Hard. Kuda Is Easy’ was created to drive wider usage of the Kuda app by Nigerians who were looking for reliable cashless payment options.
In a statement, Mustapha noted that Kuda put together the campaign against the backdrop of the recent cash scarcity experienced by Nigerians and the subsequent shift in consumer behaviour away from a widespread reliance on cash toward using cashless payment channels.
Mustapha said, “Nigerians went through a lot during the cash scarcity, and it was only natural for them to find alternatives to cash. More people are now open to cashless payments beyond cards and transfers, and we want them to know that there are reliable options for them on the Kuda app.” 






He said the campaign aimed to deepen awareness and knowledge of the advantages of cashless payments, and that all that a customer required was to own an Internet-connected smartphone, and be eligible to open a bank account with his Bank Verification Number and a valid ID.

Commenting on the cashless payment features on the Kuda app, the co-founder said Kuda customers who had their BVN to their Kuda profile would get the fintech’s standard 25 free transfers to any Nigerian bank every month.
He added, “Pay With Bank’, a feature on the Kuda app which allows its customers to pay directly from their Kuda account on websites and apps that accept payments through Paystack, has been in the limelight recently as a reliable alternative to using cards for online payments.        
“With a secure code known as Pay ID which they generate on their Kuda app, Kuda customers can pay easily online through Pay With Bank without using a debit card.”
He added that, “The fintech’s Pay with USSD feature also makes cardless payments on PoS terminals and websites possible for anyone who uses a smartphone.
“With these features, Kuda is positioning itself at the forefront of the race toward a cashless Nigeria and aims to make payments easier for everyday people.”
