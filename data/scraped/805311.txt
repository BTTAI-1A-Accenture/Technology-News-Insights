According to the Covina Valley Unified School District, the Covina Police Department responded to the school at 463 S. Hollenbeck Ave. Monday on a report of an unspecified threat. Detectives conducted a search and determined the threat was not credible and that the school was safe to resume normal operations, according to the district. There were no injuries to students or staff. District officials said there were some “inaccurate posts on social media” about the campus, but “none of the rumors are accurate.” A bomb threat on May 15 targeting the school forced a partial evacuation of the campus, but that report also turned out to be unfounded. “In light of these non-credible threats, there will be additional security and police presence at the school throughout the remainder of the school year,” according to the district.
