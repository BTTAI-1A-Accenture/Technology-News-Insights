UNC football didn’t lose, so we’ll reward the Tar Heels with an average report card for their double overtime victory against App State on Saturday.  Running back Omarion Hampton had a career night, quarterback Drake Maye had the go-ahead touchdown and UNC’s defense got a stop to seal the win against the feisty Mountaineers, who earned a win in 2019 – the last time they played in Chapel Hill.  Here are our grades from the Tar Heels’ second game of the 2023 season.  Omarion Hampton was sensational and Drake Maye made key plays to keep UNC’s offense on track. After coming up short on fourth down in the first quarter, the Tar Heels rebounded to put up 40. The pass defense struggled at times and the Tar Heels didn’t have a sack, but they got a fourth-down stop to win the game in the second overtime.  HOW UNC SURVIVED AGAINST APP STATE:UNC football shakes off scare from App State in double overtime MAYE DAY:Heisman hopeful Drake Maye on never-ending quest to improve for UNC football UNC had a chance to win it in regulation and missed a field goal that allowed App State another opportunity in overtime.  Nothing crazy, nothing special.
