                         OLED TVs produce light from each pixel rather than being illuminated from the sides or rear like their LED counterparts. OLEDs can achieve darker blacks because the TV can just turn off that pixel's illumination. Having greater contrast and better viewing angles often leads to richer colors and greater accuracy, but the brightness levels traditionally haven't been as high. That's beginning to change for bigger sizes, but the latest tech takes a while to trickle down to smaller models like these.
                         Traditional LEDs are still generally available at lower prices and are brighter, with some TVs capable of outputting well over 5,000 nits. QLED from Samsung is another form of LED TV that includes a Quantum Dot layer between the backlight and the display to make the picture brighter.
                         Premium models often fall under the premium Neo QLED brand, which uses Mini LED technology to improve picture quality. It rivals OLED levels of light control and accuracy, alongside incredible LED brightness, and that's all because the LEDs in the backlight not only stretch across the whole of the screen but are also much smaller. This means there is much more control over the brightness levels in the different areas of the television and reduces the blooming some standard LED TVs can experience.
