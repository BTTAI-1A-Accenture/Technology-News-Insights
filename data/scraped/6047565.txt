   on October 9, 2023 at 10:29AM PDT  Pokemon TCG Holiday Calendar 2023   $40 (was $50)   Pokemon TCG Trick or Trade Booster Bundle 2023   $20  The Pokemon Trading Card Game Holiday Calendar is on sale for $40 at Walmart as part of the retailer's Holiday Kickoff sale, which is competing with Prime Day Round 2. This is the first discount we've seen on the Pokemon-themed advent calendar that includes a handful of Pokemon TCG booster packs and other goodies. While you're picking up the advent calendar, you should also consider grabbing the Trick or Trade Booster Bundle. Though it's not discounted at the moment, Halloween is right around the corner, and Pokemon booster packs are cooler than candy, right? The Pokemon Holiday Calendar includes tons of goodies spread out over 25 days. After opening all 25, you’ll have the following: We also included links to Amazon and Best Buy in case Walmart sells out. It's possible those retailers could match Walmart's deal. The Trick or Trade Booster Bundle is only $20 and comes with 50 mini packs that contain three cards each--and it’s bound to make your home a hot destination on the spookiest night of the year. Or, you can keep the pack for yourself and reap the rewards of 150 spooky cards. The Trick or Trade Booster Bundle was available last year too, and it sold out prior to Halloween (and returned afterward).
