Instead, holding companies own controlling stakes in other companies. The main purpose of a holding company is to offer centralized management, and they may also be used for tax or liability purposes. So while it may oversee a subsidiary’s management decisions, a holding company does not actively engage in the daily operations of these subsidiaries. While a holding company structure can be complicated to navigate, it offers multiple benefits including centralized management and control, limited liability, tax relief, flexibility in terms of investment opportunities and diversifying risk, and branding and reputation management. However, holding companies are subject to additional regulations, limited control over the day-to-day operations of their subsidiary companies, dependence on the performance of subsidiary companies, and problems in raising capital.  Some of the best holding company stocks to invest in include JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021. Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles: Disclosure: None. 12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.
