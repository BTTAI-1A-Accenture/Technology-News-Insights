The company only offers one basic LLC plan that costs $99 and has limited add-on options, whereas competitors offer free basic plans with additional features.  However, its membership subscription outshines its standalone business formation services. If you opt for a new Rocket Lawyer membership, you can get the LLC formation service for free, along with a handful of other perks, such as access to a lawyer to answer business questions. Founded in 2008 in San Francisco, Rocket Lawyer is an online tech company that provides legal services to individuals and businesses. It’s helped over 20 million customers create legal documents, incorporate businesses, provide advice from attorneys and more.  Overall, Rocket Lawyer’s customers seem to be generally satisfied. The company has a 4.6-star rating on TrustPilot with nearly 6,000 reviews. However, all of those reviews are reflective of the company’s services as a whole, not just its standalone LLC service — which we’ll evaluate in-depth here. Rocket Lawyer only offers one LLC service plan, and it costs more but offers less than comparable plans on the market. However, if you opt for the company’s membership plan as a first-time user, you may be able to get a better value.   Rocket Lawyer’s LLC business incorporation service costs $99.99 plus the fee charged by your state. In exchange, you get your business name and articles of organization filed. It doesn’t come with any additional features, but there are many you can add on during the registration process.  Tip: State filing fees range from $40 up to $500 and are added on top of any fee charged by the LLC service provider you choose.  While there’s no other standalone LLC plan option, you can get the LLC service for free if you sign up for a new membership with Rocket Lawyer. If you already have a Rocket Lawyer membership, you’ll qualify for a discount on your LLC filing, but it’s only 25% off instead of the full 100%.  A Rocket Lawyer membership may be a good option for your newly formed business, however, the membership model isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking to file your LLC paperwork and would prefer a one-time payment or free plan, you should consider one of the other providers on our best LLC services list. But, if you could benefit from additional business services, you may want to learn more about Rocket Lawyer’s $39.99 per month or $239.99 per year membership.  For reference, the Rocket Lawyer membership provides ongoing access to legal documents for hundreds of purposes, attorney services and discounts on professional services like tax filing and trademark applications. If you’re curious but not ready to invest, you can try it for seven days to see if it’s something your business needs on an ongoing basis.  While the Rocket Lawyer LLC plan is pretty bare-bones, there are a few additional services you can add during the online registration process. Here’s a look at the options.  State governments require each LLC to have a registered agent — a representative who is present within the state of incorporation and available for correspondence during normal business hours.  If you need someone to fill this role, you can hire a registered agent through Rocket Lawyer. The service costs $249.99 per year for non-members. Rocket Lawyer members receive get the same service for $124.99. With Rocket Lawyer’s registered agent services, you can:  If you want to purchase Rocket Lawyer’s registered agent services, you must call the company. If you pay for the full-year membership upfront, you will save 50% off the price if you were to pay monthly. You can manage your Rocket Lawyer account through a mobile app — a feature many competitors lack. The mobile app may be especially handy if you run a remote business or travel often for work. When looking at prices, Rocket Lawyer is relatively high priced in the industry. Other providers, like Northwest Registered Agent and Bizee, offer cheaper registered agent services for businesses. As you consider this service, however, Eric Lee, Co-Founder of REIInsiders, LLC, a real estate investing education company, encourages businesses that “price should not be the primary factor when choosing a registered agent service. It is important to consider the features offered and the provider’s reputation, as well as the cost.” Rocket Lawyer’s registered agent services are available in all 50 states. That means you can get support no matter where you live in the country. Rocket Lawyer’s nationwide availability can help you expand your enterprise worry-free. Most LLCs will need to register an EIN with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It’s a number that’s used to identify your business, similar to how social security numbers identify individuals. While you can get one for free on the IRS website, Rocket Lawyer provides a done-for-you EIN service for $59.99.  RocketLawyer offers tax preparation and certified public accountant (CPA) services starting at $399.99. In these plans, you get your tax filings prepared on the federal and state level. Subsequent plans add features like year-end bookkeeping, business structuring advice to maximize tax savings and an overall tax analysis to help you save money.  While these add-ons can help new LLCs beyond the company formation step, many competitors offer a wider selection. For example, it’s common to see operating agreements, banking resolutions, business bank accounts and free tax consultations included in LLC service plans. However, Rocket Lawyer primarily relies on a membership business model that offers legal documents and consultations with its membership plan, but not a la carte.  Rocket Lawyer offers a few different customer support channels, but they could use some improvement.  You can call the customer service line Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. PT. When calling, we experienced a wait time of around three minutes and had one person in front of us. After waiting, we were told an operator wasn’t available and were forwarded to voicemail. You can also leave a voicemail from the start of the call and receive a callback. If you prefer email, you can fill out the company’s contact form on the contact us page. Rocket Lawyer will get back to you through the email address you leave. However, no response time is provided. While there’s no live chat option, there is an instant help feature. You can type a question into the search box on the contact us page and it will search a knowledge base for an answer. While helpful for some problems, it wasn’t able to answer many questions we asked. The FAQ page has some information, but it’s similarly limited.  As for the website, it provides a decent user experience. You can purchase the LLC plan within minutes, however, detailed information isn’t easy to find. Many competitors have charts showing the plans, features and pricing. With Rocket Lawyer, you have to go through the registration process to learn what’s available and at what cost. LegalZoom offers a lower starting price, so it’s a better choice if you’re looking for a basic service to help you file your LLC formation documents. That said, if you need LLC formation and registered agent services, Rocket Lawyer’s basic plan with the registered agent add-on would be the better option. You’d break even the first year and then would save $100 per year in every year following.  For those looking for more support, the best choice will depend on what you need, as the prices are comparable (Rocket Lawyer membership and LegalZoom paid plans). Both companies offer legal consultations on new legal topics and the ability to ask a lawyer questions.  Beyond that, LegalZoom includes an operating agreement and an EIN, while Rocket Lawyer provides access to hundreds of customizable legal documents and a document signing tool (RocketSign).  Bizee comes out ahead here for a basic LLC formation, with or without a registered agent service. Its Silver plan is free for the first year (before the state fee), which is hard to beat.  The next option is Bizee’s Gold plan. For $199, it includes everything on the Silver plan plus a business bank account, business tax consultation, an operating agreement, an EIN, a banking resolution and more.  If you’re signing up for a new Rocket Lawyer annual membership plan for $239.99, you’d also get free LLC filing, but it wouldn’t cover the cost of a registered agent service or EIN. Instead, you’d get access to Rocket Lawyer’s large collection of customizable legal documents and lawyers. Both companies come highly rated by previous customers, so it’ll depend on your budget and which services better suit your business’s needs. The Gold Bizee plan can help you get up and running with more of a done-for-you service, while the Rocket Lawyer membership gives you resources outside the scope of LLC formation to get advice and DIY your documents. If you want ongoing access to Rocket Lawyer’s extensive library of document templates and network of lawyers, it can make sense to get your LLC through the company due to the free LLC formation discount for new members.  If you’re already a Rocket Lawyer member or aren’t interested in the membership services, you’ll benefit from looking elsewhere. Many companies offer to file your LLC formation documents for free, before state fees and offer other perks. Further, if you need a registered agent service, the $249.99 for non-members is on the higher end. Overall, Rocket Lawyer is a long-standing, reputable company that is well-rated by customers. However, its reputation has been built primarily on its membership services, not the LLC standalone offering. While it can make sense in some situations, it’s probably not going to be the best option for most.  Methodology We extensively research the key competitors within an industry to determine the best products and services for your business.

Rocket Lawyer doesn’t have a worry-free annual compliance program, but the registered agent service does come with alerts for tax and legal deadlines.  No, Rocket Lawyer doesn’t charge any hidden fees for its LLC service. You will encounter a variety of options with added costs throughout the registration process, but none of them are mandatory. For the LLC process as a non-member, you’ll only be responsible for the $99.99 fee plus the state fee.
