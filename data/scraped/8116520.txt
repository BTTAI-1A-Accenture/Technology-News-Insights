 When your iPhone isn't receiving picture messages it can be incredibly frustrating. After all, nowadays we communicate with friends and family via iMessages littered with memes and photos of what we had for dinner last night. Whether you've got the best iPhone available, like the iPhone 15 Pro Max, or an older device like the iPhone SE, bugs can often impact your ability to do the things that should be relatively easy. With iOS 18 on the horizon, it's good to know how to fix these issues if your iPhone ever has issues with receiving pictures. Here's how to fix your iPhone not receiving pictures in text messages with a few easy fixes that should solve any issues to get you back to 2024 in no time at all.  John-Anthony worked at Apple's Genius Bar for years and has seen many issues related to pictures not appearing on a customer's iPhone. Luckily, he's here to help and will get your photos back into Messages so you don't have to miss out on sharing memories. In addition to iMessage, the iPhone supports MMS, which is a simplified way to send a text message via a cellular network. If you have MMS disabled on your iPhone, you won't be able to send or receive multimedia messages like photos or videos with Android users or when iMessage is unavailable.  Another thing that you can try is signing in, and out of the Apple ID you use with Messages. Signing out of Messages will delete all your messages from your iPhone and re-download them as new from Apple's servers when you sign back in.   The last thing you can try is resetting Network Settings on your iPhone. Although it may sound a little daunting, this option will only remove some behind-the-scenes configurations, toggle Wi-Fi/cellular on and off briefly, and change your iPhone name to the default state. iMore offers spot-on advice and guidance from our team of experts, with decades of Apple device experience to lean on.
