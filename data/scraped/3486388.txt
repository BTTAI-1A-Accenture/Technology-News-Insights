WHAT: Fast Track Passwordless MFA by Avoiding Five Common Pitfalls
It's no secret that passwords and traditional MFA are at their breaking point. But Passwordless MFA faces many adoption challenges, including unverified biometrics that rely principally on device possession for identity verification. In this session, Mike Engle will explain how verified identity provides a mechanism to truly know who is on the other end of a digital connection and present a low-friction roadmap for moving users gracefully to passwordless.

 
Bringing Verified Identity and Passwordless to the Masses
Today's authentication challenges are mainly associated with phishing and often compromise a user's device, not their identity. In this session 1Kosmos and AWS will review how a user's true identity can be used for authentication and how this approach can be rolled out for the masses.
