LSU defeated Florida to win the College World Series finals, clinching the championship with an 18-4 victory in Game 3. The Tigers went 11-2 in the NCAA Tournament, sweeping through the Baton Rouge Regional and Super Regional. They went 6-2 in Omaha, beating Tennessee, Wake Forest and Florida along the way. The national championship is the seventh in program history for LSU, the second most all-time. Its last title came in 2009. The Tigers are also just the second team in the 21st century to win the national championship after being ranked No. 1 in the Preseason Top 25, joining 2019 Vanderbilt. Wake Forest was ranked No. 1 in the Top 25 at the end of the regular season and falls to No. 3 after losing to LSU in the bracket final. That is still the Demon Deacons’ highest finish to the season in the 43-year history of the Top 25. Indiana State (11) and Campbell (22) also establish new highs for a final ranking. The staff of Baseball America determines the Top 25 rankings. Records indicated are through the end of the season. 1.

The Gators put together an impressive NCAA Tournament run, overcoming an early loss in regionals to Texas Tech to come through the loser’s bracket and win the Gainesville Regional. They then swept South Carolina in super regionals and swept their CWS bracket before falling to the Tigers. Florida made its first trip to Omaha since 2018 and fell one win shy of the program’s second national championship.3. Wake Forest (ACC)Previous Ranking: No. 1Overall: 54-12, 22-7 in ACCWeekend Record: 14-0NCAA Tournament: 7-2, reached OmahaWake dominated its competition in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament and advanced to the CWS with a plus-59 run differential. The Demon Deacons started 2-0 in Omaha despite not leading before the eighth inning in either game against Stanford or LSU, but a pair of tough losses to the Tigers ultimately knocked them out of the tournament in the bracket final. It was the first time all season that the Deacs lost back-to-back games. Wake still finished with a program-record 54 wins, the ACC title and its first trip to Omaha since its 1955 national championship.4. Texas Christian (Big 12)Previous Ranking: No. 24Overall: 44-24, 13-11 in Big 12Weekend Record: 8-6NCAA Tournament: 7-2, reached OmahaTCU heated up in May and rode that momentum all the way to Omaha.

The Volunteers advanced to the CWS for the second time in three seasons and won their first game in Omaha since 2001.

Stanford (Pac-12)Previous Ranking: No. 6Overall: 44-20, 23-7 in Pac-12Weekend Record: 11-2-1NCAA Tournament: 6-4, reached OmahaStanford produced another strong season, winning the Pac-12 title for the second straight season and making a third straight trip to the CWS. The Cardinal didn’t make it easy on themselves in the NCAA Tournament, first fighting through the loser’s bracket in regionals and then coming back from a game 1 loss to beat Texas. Stanford’s three straight Omaha appearances are its most since going five straight times from 1999-2003.7. Oral Roberts (Summit League)Previous Ranking: NROverall: 52-14, 23-1 in Summit LeagueWeekend Record: 12-2NCAA Tournament: 6-3, reached OmahaOral Roberts was the underdog story of the NCAA Tournament. It became the third No. 4 seed in the 64-team era (since 1999) to reach Omaha after it swept through the Stillwater Regional and then won the Eugene Super Regional. The Golden Eagles opened the CWS with a win against TCU before back-to-back tough losses against Florida and TCU ended their run. Only Florida, LSU and Wake Forest won more games this season than ORU, which made its second-ever trip to the CWS and first since 1978.8.

Duke (ACC)Previous Ranking: No. 21Overall: 39-24, 16-13 in ACCWeekend Record: 8-4-1NCAA Tournament: 4-3, eliminated in super regionalsDuke went on the road to win the Conway Regional and won its super regional opener against Virginia. But the Blue Devils weren’t able to push past the Cavaliers and lost in three games.

Indiana State (Missouri Valley)Previous Ranking: No. 25Overall: 45-17, 24-3 in Missouri ValleyWeekend Record: 11-3NCAA Tournament: 3-2, eliminated in super regionalsThe Sycamores’ remarkable run carried them through their first-ever home regional, as they swept past Wright State and Iowa.

The Scott Berry era still reached a strong conclusion, as the Golden Eagles won back-to-back regionals for the first time in program history.13. Oregon (Pac-12)Previous Ranking: NROverall: 41-22, 16-14 in Pac-12Weekend Record: 9-5NCAA Tournament: 4-2, eliminated in super regionalsOregon carried the momentum from its Pac-12 Tournament title run into the NCAA Tournament and swept through the Nashville Regional, beating Xavier and Vanderbilt.
