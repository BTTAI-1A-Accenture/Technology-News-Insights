BETHESDA, MD — Z-Burger is moving to downtown Bethesda, taking over the space on Fairmont Avenue previously leased by BGR, according to a report. Signage was installed on the restaurant’s exterior on Tuesday, Robert Dyer @ Bethesda Row reported. Z-Burger is known as a local burger place enjoyed by former President Bill Clinton, according to Robert Dyer. The restaurant at 4827 Fairmont Avenue at Veterans Park will be Z-Burger’s first location in Bethesda. The fast food chain has nine locations in the D.C. area and one in Towson. Z-Burger serves burgers, hot dogs, cheese steaks, fries and onion rings, and a veggie burger. It is also well known for its many varieties of milkshakes. BGR, which stands for “Burgers Grilled Right,” closed its restaurant at the location in late 2022. It was BGR’s original location and had been open since 2008. Earlier this month, the McLean location of Z-Burger lost hundreds of dollars after a scammer claiming to be with DoorDash was able to connect to the restaurant’s account with the delivery service. Z-Burger owner Peter Tabibian told WUSA9 that a person impersonating a DoorDash representative was able to get information that allowed the scammer to hack into his business's bank accounts.
