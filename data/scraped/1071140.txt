In 2022, 897 MMcfd of interstate natural gas pipeline  capacity was added collectively from five projects, according to the latest US Energy Information Administration (EIA) State-to-State Capacity Tracker,  the least since the agency began data collection in 1995. Capacity, however,  was added to intrastate pipelines and to existing Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC)-administered interstate pipelines.  EIA attributed the low interstate capacity additions in 2022  to two primary reasons: In previous years, interstate pipeline capacity was added  from looping and compressor station projects that were designed to accommodate  growing Appalachia production, but all of the planned projects in the region  are mostly completed. Since 2017, EIA said, about 70% of the growth in natural  gas production has come from the Permian and Haynesville regions, near LNG  plants along the Gulf Coast. In Texas and Louisiana and leading to growth in  intrastate projects to reach the plants. Of the five projects EIA listed as increasing interstate  capacity to transport natural gas, only one added any new pipe, with the others  accomplished entirely through compressor upgrades:Â
