Mr Wagers was told last week he was out, according to media reports, and will end his tenure at Flexport tomorrow. He had quite a stellar career before joining Flexport two and a half years ago.

And there is another casualty – Jennifer Boden, VP for people, tech and employee experience. She has only been at the company for eight months having left Snap Inc. She also spent 12 years at Amazon. Meanwhile, another former Amazon executive, Michael Brown, who joined Flexport in June 2021, is to become “head of restructuring and CEO initiatives” – reportedly in charge of Flexport becoming customer-centric and “returning to profitability”. It is thought that more staff will go. In January, Flexport fired some 20% of its staff – although it was keen to note at the time that it was also hiring. Yesterday, it was revealed that it had invested in a start-up which promises to cut truck brokerage fees out of the logistics equation. Flexport is not alone. As Loadstar Premium exclusively reports today, a major forwarder is cutting some 450 jobs, according to Premium sources.
