If you landed on this page, there's a 90 percent chance you're wondering where to buy sex toys online. Lucky for you, I've got the answer: Do all your sexy shopping at stores you trust *and* that have a stamp of approval from PureWow editors. Because if there's anything PureWow editors are super passionate about, it's sex toys. To narrow down the list, I ordered a bunch of goodies from top brands and retailers in the biz (including Lovehoney, PinkCherry and Amazon, to name a few), tested their products and reviewed their shipping processes. So, whether you're on a mission to find a new rabbit vibrator that checks all the boxes or are hoping to secure one of the best sex toys for couples, you can put your trust in the 16 stores on this list (which I can confirm ship discreetly). You can also take my word that all the toys mentioned in this story (from bullet vibrators to quiet devices and more sex toys for women) are worth every penny and then some. Are you pulsating with excitement yet? Well, keep reading to find out everything you need to know about the best places to buy sex toys online in 2024. To vet our choices, PureWow Senior Editor Dana Dickey interviewed sex therapists and company reps and studied the biggest sellers on the market. Meanwhile, I researched the top-rated sex toys on the internet and ordered 20 products from 15 brands and retailers (not limited to Womanizer, Lelo and Dame) to find out if their shipping process was as discreet as they claimed it to be. Then, I tested the devices over five months to bring you recommendations that won't disappoint. Dickey and I also prioritized stores with a wide variety of products made with quality materials for gender inclusivity. Ease of navigating sites also came into play since we're sensitive to how overwhelming an encyclopedic array of choices can be. In the end, we called out, for better and worse, companies that maintain a strong educational component on their sites—beyond just instructions on how to use the gizmos. With that, we gathered the 16 most user-friendly places to buy sex toys online, and I pulled out a few of my favorite goodies so you can have the best (secret) shopping spree. Want to know which buzzy products are *really* worth buying? Sign up for our shopping newsletter to uncover our favorite finds. Lovehoney I appreciate this online sex toy superstore for its wide selection and reasonable prices on everything from the usual suspects (wands, dildos, etc.) to more wide-ranging sexual health offerings, from both its own Lovehoney brand and top sexual wellness makers. The beloved Lovehoney Jessica rabbit vibrator ($40) pictured above is one of my go-to's, and I'll tell you why. Thanks to its classic bunny ears and rotating shaft, I hit O-town every time I pull out this toy. Plus, it's one of the only rabbit vibrators still on the market with the OG rotating function. Not to mention, it made my list of the best rabbit vibrators that money can buy, which features several options from the site. So, it's safe to say this cornucopia of adult toys is easy to navigate, with sections featuring sex toys, vibrators, male toys, dildos, lingerie, bondage, lubes & essentials, sexual wellness (including menopause solutions), best sellers and deals—and there's even a section on sex ed, including free webinars. What's more, the site offers a 20 percent student discount, and has fun collabs with favorite brands like Womanizer and affordable Gen Z brand Romp. shop now Lovehoney Jessica Rabbit Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Frabbit-vibrators%2Fp%2Flovehoney-jessica-rabbit-10-function-rabbit-vibrator%2Fa14099g14850.html&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 40 Buy It We-Vibe Melt App Controlled Rechargeable Clitoral Stimulator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Fclitoral-suction-vibrators%2Fp%2Fwe-vibe-melt-app-controlled-rechargeable-clitoral-stimulator%2Fa41322g75287.html&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 149 Buy It Lovehoney Rose Clitoral Suction Stimulator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lovehoney.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fvibrators%2Fclitoral-suction-vibrators%2Fp%2Flovehoney-rose-clitoral-suction-stimulator%2Fa47373g84894.html&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 40 Buy It PinkCherry This online shop, which sells multiple top brands, including We-Vibe and Lelo, understands that not everyone knows a lot about sex toys, so they've made it easy to browse vibrators, dildos and anal sex toys, as well as a vertical dedicated to gender expression and affirmation. PinkCherry has great deals on its sale page, including a number of its own brand offerings, from an under-$10 Finger Gee G-Vibe designed to target sensitive areas from the inside out to a high-powered and high-design Le Wand vibrator ($200; $170). Expect a wide variety of choices, including the Romp Rose clitoral stimulator ($100; $25) that I'm still hooked on to this day. Seriously, if there's any rose toy you should buy, it's the Romp Rose. Unlike other models, this one lets you pop off the tip (aka the part that's meant to go over your clitoris) to give it a good wash. shop now Romp Rose Clitoral Stimulator https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkcherry.com%2Fproducts%2Fromp-rose-clitoral-stimulator&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 25 Buy It CalExotics Scandal Bed Restraints https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkcherry.com%2Fcollections%2Fbondage-and-fetish%2Fproducts%2Fscandal-bed-restraints&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 48 Buy It PinkCherry Hide My Vibe Bullet Vibe https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinkcherry.com%2Fproducts%2Fpinkcherry-hide-my-vibe-bullet-vibe&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 20 Buy It PlusOne In the first year after it launched in 2018, the New York Times reported that this brand accounted for 26 percent of the sexual massager market. Why is it in such high demand? It's because the happy-hued adult toys are sold in Walmart, are easy to use *and* on average cost around $30. Yet the quality is still there—medical-grade silicone, water-resistant chassis and magnetic recharging cords. "Best vibe I've ever had!" writes one reviewer about the brand's PlusOne Dual massager ($30). "The dual vibrators are an A design (one in the main part and one in the 'rabbit'). The main part of it, boy can it reach places! Hitting two spots at the same time is a *chef kiss.* Recharging it via USB is wonderful, no running out of power and finding out you don't have any fresh batteries (what a huge disappointment that is). The whole thing feels a bit floppy but that extra give helps you find those sweet spots. Its price? Absolutely worth the $30. Go buy one and treat yourself!"

But look closer—those sculptures are actually highly engineered adult toys including vibrators, massagers and plugs. Besides being pretty to look at, this bright collection of silicone-and-ABS plastic toys has a hidden selling point: innovative tech. For example, the Lelo Enigma ($199) is a three-motor flexible silicone massager that has eight settings and uses sonic waves. And just so you know, it's one of my favorite sex toys ever, and believe it or not, it's not just because it feels as luxurious as it looks. The Enigma has blessed me with some of the most intense orgasms I've ever had. So, yeah, I think it's worth every penny. Plus, it's designed to stimulate visible and internal clitoral areas, as well as the G-spot. But you also can't go wrong with the Sila ($169)—a “sonic clitoral massager” that uses a humming vibration to create a wider area of stimulation than other clitoral stimulators. (It's devised to make a slower, stronger build to climax.) This site also gets high marks for its “how to use” drawings, while the sex-fantasy video montages are entertaining. And did I mention all the toys are waterproof? shop now Lelo Enigma https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lelo.com%2Fenigma&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 199 Buy It Lelo Sila https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lelo.com%2Fsila&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 169 Buy It Lelo Soraya 2 Rabbit Vibrator https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8757841-14521322?sid=buy+sex+toys+online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lelo.com%2Fsoraya-2 172 Buy It Adam & Eve I'm a fan of the encyclopedic nature of this online superstore, along with its strong educational elements. Not only does the site have a handy drop-down glossary menu that explains how some of the less intuitive items are meant to be used, but Adam & Eve has its own resident sex expert, Dr. Jenni, who runs a clinical sex therapy practice in Colorado and has a series of YouTube videos called "Savvy Sex in 60 Seconds." The site also has a clever “vibrator wizard” quiz that helps pin down which device is right for you. And the reviews reveal a discerning customer, for example with this All-American Whopper dong ($35; $30) review: “It has a great suction base and sticks well to different types of surfaces, but may come off if you’re having way too much fun with it. Very nice fit inside, especially with the curve, and fun to use with or without your significant other.” From that harness-compatible dildo to a vibrating penis ring ($130; $110) that I'm happy to confirm also acts as a *handheld vibrator* when no penises are around, Adam & Eve definitely has what you’re looking for. shop now All American Whopper Dong https://www.pntra.com/t/TEFNS0xNQUZEREZMSkFFREtLTEc?sid=buy-sex-toys-online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adameve.com%2Fadult-sex-toys%2Fdildo-sex-toys%2Frealistic-dildos%2Fsp-inch-all-american-dong-12618.aspx 30 Buy It Verge By We-Vibe Penis Ring https://www.pjatr.com/t/TEFNS0xNQUZEREZMSkFFREtLTEc?sid=buy-sex-toys-online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adameve.com%2Fadult-sex-toys%2Fpenis-rings%2Fsp-verge-by-we-vibe-vibrating-ring-104043.aspx 110 Buy It Fifty Shades Of Grey Inner Goddess Silver Jiggle Balls https://www.gopjn.com/t/TEFNS0xNQUZEREZMSkFFREtLTEc?sid=buy-sex-toys-online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adameve.com%2Fadult-sex-toys%2Fben-wa-balls%2Fsp-fifty-shades-of-grey-inner-goddess-silver-jiggle-balls-106945.aspx Buy It Dame This female-founded brand has the aesthetic appeal and sexual promise of a weekend at a hipster hotel by the beach. Dame designs and makes attractive and inventive sex toys. Available in colors like quartz, lavender, jade and navy, you’ll be tempted to leave them on your bedside table rather than hide them away when you’re not using them. The hero product of the collection is the Eva couples vibrator ($140), which received a whopping 93 out of 100 in a PureWow100 review. "I didn’t have to do much to experience the full benefits of the Eva," Stephanie Meraz shared in her review. "In just a few minutes of maneuvering, I figured out where the device sits best for maximum clitoris stimulation and which speed I preferred." BTW, the small, hands-free vibrator has retractable arms that are meant to be tucked inside your outer labia and hold the vibrating part against the clitoris during penetrative sex. However, if you ask me, the Arc G-spot vibrator (from $79)—featuring five intensity levels—is not to be overlooked. In fact, it's one of the very few sex toys I practice patience with, and I'm not the only one. One reviewer adds, "I've always struggled to feel internal pleasure and tend to rush my solo orgasms by just shoving a vibe on my clit and calling at a day. [But} this toy has been helping me [form] a more mindful connection with my body and my pleasure and actually explore what feels good both internally and externally." And there’s no risk—the brand promises fast *and* discreet billing and shipping. shop now Dame Arc G-Spot Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdame.com%2Fproducts%2Farc%3Fvariant%3D41519397273783&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 79 Buy It Dame Dip Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdame.com%2Fproducts%2Fdip%3Fvariant%3D41494033858743&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 35 Buy It Dame Eva Couples Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdame.com%2Fproducts%2Feva-ii%3Fvariant%3D41346718236855&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 140 Buy It Maude Minimalists swear by this site’s core collection of vibrators and associated products. The elegant flutter-tip Vibe ($49) has three super-quiet speeds, is made of platinum-grade silicone and charges through a near-invisible slot in its side. The company also engineered a tantalizing vibrating plug called Cone, Medium ($49) for your rear made of their platinum-grade silicone. It's got three speeds and a 90-minute runtime. But here's why I don't regret buying it: To put it simply, it was a fun way to explore butt play on my own, and the Cone wasn't too small or big. Another reviewer raves, "[It's] substantial enough to impress and well designed for pleasure...We are having a great time with our newest toy. Ordering was easy, shipping fast and discreet. Highly recommended." While it's notable that actor Dakota Johnson signed on as the brand's co-creative director, I'm more interested in the brand's founder, Eva Goicochea, who Forbes notes is one of only 90 women to have raised more than $1 million in VC funding. Interestingly, Maude also makes sets of couples libido gummies ($85) that seek to aid in blood flow to the genitals; it's all part of Maude's stated mission of centering sexual wellness firmly in the wellness arena. shop now Maude Spot https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1253198&u=1100777&m=83239&urllink=getmaude%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fspot&afftrack=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 79 Buy It Maude Cone, Medium https://getmaude.com/products/cone-medium?sscid=11k8_m3dy6&utm_source=ShareASale&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=1100777_1253198 49 Buy It Maude Vibe https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1253198&u=1100777&m=83239&urllink=getmaude%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fvibe%2Dpersonal%2Dmassager&afftrack=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 49 Buy It Goop Goop sex toys—like their whole sexual wellness edit—are all about getting the job done stylishly. The Double-Sided wand vibrator ($98) "is a dependable way to relax, with the ball's deep rumbly pulsations—there are eight settings on the one end alone—getting right where it needs to, even with my short arms," one user told Dickey. And apart from the handful of Goop-branded toys, the site sells other sleek and gift-worthy finds, like the Crave Vesper 2 vibrator ($98) that doubles as a statement necklace. Whenever I wear it, I feel sexy AF. It's like I have a secret around my neck, and I don't have to tell anyone if I don't want to. No one ever questions it, and while it's not exactly the most pleasurable vibrator you can buy, it has four speeds and two modes that'll get things going. In other words, don't sleep on Goop—its got all the good stuff! shop now Crave Vesper 2 https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8757841-14500220?sid=buy+sex+toys+online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fcrave-vesper-2-vibrator%2Fp%2F%3Fvariant_id%3D122456 98 Buy It Goop Heartthrob Vibrator https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8757841-14500220?sid=buy+sex+toys+online&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fgoop-wellness-heartthrob-vibrator%2Fone-size%2Fp%2F 98 Buy It Goop Double-Sided Wand Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fgoop-wellness-double-sided-wand-vibrator%2Fp%2F&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 98 Buy It Amazon Not only is an Amazon delivery discreet—Nothing to see here, neighbor! Just the usual plain brown Amazon box on our doormat!—but the selection of toys, lubes and accessories is wide and deep on the site. Here, you can find an array of prices and toy types, and get everything you order in just a couple days (or sooner for Prime members). You can skim through the different stores available on Amazon to see which one has the right saucy toys that are up your alley and even narrow down your choices based on the number of 5-star reviews. For starters, there's this Satisfyer Pro 2 Generation 3 ($60) that I would trade in my boyfriend for. No, seriously, it mimics the sensation of pulsating water and oral stimulation, which you can enjoy in 11 intensities thanks to the brand's trusty Air Pulse function that sucks and throbs. And don't even get me started on the Vlatne Rose vibrator, which is one of the biggest TikTok sensations. Here's what one reviewer had to say about it: “The Rose vibrator toy is unbelievable! It's a great gift for all your girlfriends, too. Gets the job done for sure. I would highly recommend it; it will be the best rose you ever got.” Oh, you already added it to your cart? Good idea, but just a general tip: While Amazon has great sales, be sure to double-check seller reviews if a brand you're after is at an impossibly low price—an unscrupulous seller might be trying to pass off a copy of the item you want. shop now Satisfyer Pro 2 Generation 3 https://www.amazon.com/Satisfyer-Pro-Generation-Stimulating-Rechargeable/dp/B0BVTNNZYJ?&linkCode=ll1&tag=pur0e4-20&linkId=c0b38e8aaf1b1d5a425ccd734b9ff249&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl 60 Buy It Vlatne Rose Vibrator https://www.amazon.com/Vlatne-Stimulator-Mind-Blowing-Masturbating-Vibrating/dp/B09TVNDPFL?&linkCode=sl1&tag=pur0e4-20&linkId=b238bf5c5e2963b03c6da76672325ccb&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl 16 Buy It Tusuuo BDSM Neck to Wrist Restraints Bondage Set https://www.amazon.com/BDSM-Neck-Wrist-Bondage-Restraints/dp/B09WCXFC1S?&linkCode=ll1&tag=pur0e4-20&linkId=b1425a85c4ce9a6bce89383e1bd0e40b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl 10 Buy It Babeland Founded in 1993 in response to the lack of woman-friendly sex toy shops in Seattle, this female-founded online retailer now has multiple brick-and-mortar locations. I like that it has multiple new brands as well as classics such as Magic Wand (ahem, Samantha Jones-approved brand from Sex and the City). Just so you know, I have the Magic Wand Plus ($70), and while it needs to be plugged in to function, the four speeds and silicone head make up for it (if you know what I mean). Just in case you don't, just think of it as the perfect massager for down there, but don't sleep on Babeland's other sex toy offerings. The thriving online hub's got thoughtful, informative posts on topics including gentle sex toys, app-controlled toys and "Rimming 101." In other words, while browsing the site, you'll be inspired to experiment in the bedroom by treating yourself and your partner to a couples' toy like a strap-on set or a harness. shop now Magic Wand Plus https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.babeland.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fp%2FBL33930%2Fmagic-wand%2Fmagic-wand-plus%3F&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 70 Buy It Good Vibes Toys Echo Silicone Rechargeable Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.babeland.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fp%2FBL36067%2Fgood-vibes-toys%2Fecho-silicone-rechargeable-vibrator%3F&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 55 Buy It NS Novelties Colours Anal Trainer Set https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.babeland.com%2Fsex-toys%2Fp%2FBL41887%2Fns-novelties%2Fcolours-anal-trainer-set&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 42 Buy It Lovers Many online erotic purveyors are stuck organizing their sites in binary “men” and “women” categories. Not so with Lovers, which cuts to the chase with verticals named “Sex Toys,” “Vibrators,” etc. Under “Pulsators,” you’ll find the Womanizer Premium 2.0 ($209), designed to stimulate e-ver-y clitoral nerve ending. And as if it couldn't get any better than that, it's got 14 intensity levels (which I can confirm are anything but boring), an autopilot mode (for when you want to be extra surprised) and a waterproof silicone body (that is as smooth as it looks). High-energy types will appreciate the Jack Rabbit Signature heated thruster ($119), which is also submersible and waterproof. And with just the click of a button, you can heat the shaft to 131 Fahrenheit (or 55 degrees Celsius) in just 40 seconds, which is why I keep coming back to it, and you probably will, too. shop now Womanizer Premium 2.0 https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2Fcollections%2Fwomanizer%2Fproducts%2Fwomanizer-premium-2-black%3Fsscid%3Da1k7_2pngu%26&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 209 Buy It Cal Exotics Jack Rabbit Signature Heated Thruster https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2Fproducts%2Fjack-rabbit-signature-heated-thruster-1&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 119 Buy It Rocks Off Ruby Glow Grinder https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Floversstores.com%2Fcollections%2Fvibrators%2Fproducts%2Fruby-glow-grinder&xcust=buy%20sex%20toys%20online 59 Buy It Spencer's This shopping mall staple store has a *thriving* online presence with products including adult toys. The easy-to-navigate site includes verticals for the expected categories such as vibrators and bondage gear, as well as more unusual fare like blue raspberry throat spray for oral sex and female arousal gummies. While novelty gifts such as a glitter dildo or feline-shaped lipstick vibrator might get laughs at the bachelorette party, they also mean business. One reviewer writes that the Smooth AF blue vibrator ($18), "Really spices up your sex life. It feels smooth and soft and gets the job done. I don't mind using batteries instead of the sex toys that you have to charge up. Totally worth the money." Spencer’s even offers various dance pole kits so you can choose the one that best fits your budget (and bedroom ceiling height). In the site’s well-priced offerings, you’re definitely going to find something that will pique your interest, and newcomers to the world of sex toys can learn the basics or finer points of whatever sexual pursuit they're after, thanks to the site’s well-written blog. shop now Smooth AF Blue Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spencersonline.com%2Fproduct%2Fsmooth-af-blue-multi-speed-vibrator-7-inch%2F230234.uts&xcust=buy+sex+toys+online 18 Buy It Bling Bang Waterproof Wand https://go.skimresources.com?id=27667X859343&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spencersonline.com%2Fproduct%2Fbling-bang-waterproof-wand-massager-8-4-inch-sexology%2F107752.uts&xcust=buy-sex-toys-online 15 Buy It Butterfly Kiss Flicker Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spencersonline.com%2Fproduct%2Fbutterfly-kiss-flicker-rechargeable-waterproof-g-spot-vibrator-pink-7-5-inch%2F243315.uts&xcust=buy+sex+toys+online Buy It Anthropologie Sexual wellness can be found just a click away from flouncy dresses and eclectic decor at this online boutique, where industry favorites like Dame and Lelo mingle with smaller brands such as Unbound. I'm a fan of the convenience as well as the sleek, minimalist aesthetic of many of their products. A good example is the Puff vibrator ($48), which has five intensity modes and a waterproof design that will come in handy in the shower. Yes, you read that right. I took this bad boy for a spin in the bath, and I'll just say the brand wasn't kidding when it said that the toy was petite but powerful. Anthropologie also carries London-based Coco de Mer, toys that come with elegant leatherette zip cases. With frequent sales, one of these toys is a necessary add-on to your next Anthro haul. shop now Unbound Puff Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Funbound-puff-vibrator&xcust=buy+sex+toys+online 48 Buy It Coco de Mer Seed Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Fcoco-de-mer-pleasure-no-1-the-seed&xcust=buy+sex+toys+online 195 Buy It Unbound Ollie Vibrator https://go.skimresources.com/?id=27667X859343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anthropologie.com%2Fshop%2Funbound-ollie-vibrator&xcust=buy+sex+toys+online 76 Buy It Sephora Sephora's robust collection of sex toys, lubes and intimate accessories makes us appreciate just how far sexual wellness has moved into the mainstream. Case in point: the fact that you can now buy a cute bubblegum-pink toy called The Firefighter ($60) at the same time as a tube of statement lipstick and ingrown hair remover. In addition to Smile Makers (the company behind The Firefighter), Sephora also carries something called Sex Dust Adaptogens For Fire* ($38), a blend of lusty, adaptogenic herbs aimed to target stress, support a healthy hormonal and ignite some passion in and out of the bedroom.

Not all toys and brands are created equal and personal preference is key. Here are a few things that we like to keep in mind while browsing for our next big-O: "You don’t have to get products that other people like, just because someone else doing it," says Balestrieri. "Pleasure is about play, talk about what is interesting to you with people you trust—don’t forget and be open to what other people suggest." She adds that some newbies want to jump right in and want to experience all the bells and whistles, while others prefer to start more gradually. "Start small in terms of sensation, size and technical abilities," she says. "It’s easier to start small versus something more complex and overwhelming." When it comes to buying sex toys online, you can't go wrong with any of the sites on this list, from Lovehoney to Smile Makers. Just hear me out: Not only can I confirm that all 16 of 'em ship discreetly in *plain* packaging (so no one has to know what you're up to), but their selection of sex toys is massive (so you're bound to find something that checks all your boxes). While shopping at each of them, I found several options that I love, and I have no doubt that you will, too.
