Bistroo traders use a variety of tools to try and determine the direction in which the BIST market is likely to head next. These tools can roughly be divided into indicators and chart patterns. When trying to predict the Bistroo price, traders also try to identify important support and resistance levels, which can give an indication of when a downtrend is likely to slow down and when an uptrend is likely to stall. Moving averages are among the most popular Bistroo price prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for BIST over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for BIST is a sum of BISTâs closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12. In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action. 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the crypto market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the BIST price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for Bistroo. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually a sign of weakness in the BIST market. Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the BIST price. Most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of Bistroo with different granularity â for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular. Letâs use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into âcandlesâ that give us information about Bistrooâs price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display BISTâs opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that Bistroo reached within the 1-hour period. Itâs also important to pay attention to the color of the candle â a green candle means that the closing price was higher than the opening price, while a red candle tells us the opposite. Some charts will use hollow and filled candlestick bodies instead of colors to represent the same thing.  Just like with any other asset, the price action of Bistroo is driven by supply and demand. These dynamics can be influenced by fundamental events such as block reward halvings, hard forks or new protocol updates. Regulations, adoption by companies and governments, cryptocurrency exchange hacks, and other real-world events can also affect the price of BIST. The market capitalization of Bistroo can change significantly in a short period of time.   When trying to make a Bistroo forecast, many traders also try to monitor the activity of BIST âwhalesâ, which are entities and individuals that control large amounts of BIST. Since the Bistroo market is relatively small compared to traditional markets, âwhalesâ can single-handedly have a big influence on Bistrooâs price movements.   Some traders try to identify candlestick patterns when making cryptocurrency price predictions to try and get an edge over the competition. Some candlestick formations are seen as likely to forecast bullish price action, while others are seen as bearish.
