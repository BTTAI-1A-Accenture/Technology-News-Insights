  Keeping an eye out for fake news is a full-time job for our pioneering online credibility company Cyabra. The company’s AI-driven information verification platform analyzes public information on social networks to identify and protect against disinformation and reputational damage. It is quickly becoming the stamp of credibility and trust of social media actors and conversations, filtering between the real, bad and fake, including generative AI. Cyabra’s high-level clients include Mediacorp and the US State Department. The company’s year-on-year contracted ARR was up 270% in Q1 2023, and it forecasts break-even in 2024. OurCrowd is leading Cyabra’s A-2 investment round.  Our oncology pioneer OncoHost has licensed new bio-sensing technology developed at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev that predicts cancer patients’ response to a specific type of immunotherapy, Renee Ghert-Zand reports in The Times of Israel. The tech can potentially improve the effectiveness of the treatments while sparing patients the toxicity and debilitating side effects. OncoHost will conduct clinical trials and seek FDA approval, hoping to bring the product to the market within two years. “With our technology, I can take samples from pathologies from 10 years and I can do retrospective studies of thousands and thousands of patients to look for new potential patients that can respond to treatment. This will help us select the right patients with different cancer types. There is an unlimited opportunity with this technology,” says Dr. Moshe Elkabets from the Faculty of Health Sciences at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.   South Korea's leading healthcare investment company Boryung, space research non-profit Aurelia Institute, and Axiom Space are launching the Humans in Space program designed to advance human activities in space. The program is initiating a challenge for space innovators to come up with ideas that will shape future interplanetary civilization. The winners will be awarded investments and research grants to develop the ideas. Axiom Space recently completed Axiom Mission 2, its second all-private astronaut mission to the International Space Station, which lasted eight days and conducted more than 20 experiments centered on human health and the Earth's atmospheric conditions. OurCrowd has an allocation in Axiom’s current funding round.

Air EV participated in a test flight of drones as part of the Israeli government’s $16M National Drone Initiative, Sharon Wrobel reports in The Times of Israel. The company’s AIR ONE, an all-electric two-seater electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, was one of several vehicles tested. The aim of the project is to fly passengers and heavy cargo, easing traffic congestion on Israel’s busy roads, and providing more efficient commercial and public services.

The new platform will initially be trained to address banking-related questions and exclude responses outside the realm of banking and finance. The system will also be programmed to avoid providing responses that may have legal or ethical implications. The pilot program will initially involve 450 customers and will be widely available in Q4 2024. One Zero is currently funding on the OurCrowd platform.  Gro Alliance, North America’s largest independently owned corn and soybean seed production company, contracted our portfolio company BioLumic and its ultraviolet light technology to spur crop growth. The light treatment improves crop performance without genetic modification or increased use of chemicals, while reaching double-digit yield increases. “This innovation enables farmers to improve their financial and environmental performance, helps seed companies deliver on their ESG goals, and creates more climate-resilient crops,” says Jim Schweigert, president of Gro Alliance.   Our portfolio company Polarisqb is deploying its quantum-powered drug discovery technology onto a new SaaS platform. The Quantum-Aided Drug Design system helps drug discovery teams in BioTech and pharma companies quickly identify a library of top candidate molecules for drug targets.

The subscription-based platform is deployed in a secure, isolated environment tailored to the client’s specific security and organizational requirements.   TestEquity, one of the world’s largest electronics test and measurement distributors, is offering its customers the Moku product line from our portfolio company Liquid Instruments. The all-in-one hardware options can perform the functions of up to 12 software-defined instruments such as oscilloscopes or spectrum analyzers in one device, at a fraction of the cost. “The Moku platform is poised to change the test and measurement industry,” says Dan Stewart, Chief Marketing Officer at TestEquity.  The biometric fraud protection platform from our portfolio company BioCatch is now available on Microsoft Azure’s Cloud for Financial Services. The move will extend protections for banks and financial institutions transitioning to cloud-based operations. “We look forward to the enhanced opportunities this will bring to our joint customers, helping empower fraud and risk teams with behavioral biometric intelligence to act quickly, while also giving consumers a safer and frictionless digital banking experience,” says Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President, Worldwide Financial Services, Microsoft.  Moodify launched its AI-powered software for the formulation and reformulation of perfumery and fragrance, Personal Care Magazine reports. Moodify (Re)formulation allows perfumers to substitute components while maintaining the same scent profile as the original formula. The system also recommends a list of substituents – replacement molecules – rated by proximity, providing the perfumery and fragrance industry with an alternative to the time-consuming and costly process of reformulation. The software will solve the problem faced by fragrance companies dealing with new regulatory requirements and changes to price or availability of ingredients.  Looking for a job?
