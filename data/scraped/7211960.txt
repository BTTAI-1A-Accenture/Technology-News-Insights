ORLANDO -Â The Orlando Magic is beginning to fill out its roster. According to Jason Beede of the Orlando Sentinel, the Magic is signing former Utah Jazz guard Miye Oni. Oni, 26, played his college ball at Yale where he was the Ivy League Player of the Year in 2019. He was drafted with the No. 58 overall pick by the Golden State Warriors, but had his draft rights traded to the Jazz. He played 80 games for the Jazz from 2019-22 and bounced around the league a bit after a trade to the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The Thunder waived him shortly after the deal and Oni signed a contract with the New Orleans Pelicans, but he never played a game with them. That forced Oni to play overseas, signing with the London Lions in the British Basketball League. Now, Oni hopes to get back in the NBA with a shot in Orlando. With Oni and fellow new signee Trevelin Queen in the mix, the team's current roster now sits at 17 with a pair of two-way contracts (Admiral Schofield, Kevon Harris). The Magic still has a few weeks left to fill those spots with training camp coming towards the end of September. You can follow Jeremy Brener on Twitter @JeremyBrener.
