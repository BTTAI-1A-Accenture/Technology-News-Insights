The Film the Robots account on TikTok proudly proclaims that it has been “putting robots in their place since 2022.” The fact is, robots, drones and autonomous vehicles are becoming a bigger part of daily life and whether we like them or not, businesses would not be as efficient without them. So while stories of delivery robots rolling through crime scenes, or autonomous cars getting stuck in wet concrete are fun to watch on social media, it is time for businesses, regulators and society as a whole to better understand how to interact and co-exist with robots. Yariv Bash is the co-founder and CEO of on-demand drone delivery provider Flytrex, which has been successfully making drone deliveries in numerous U.S. communities for several years now. He joined Talking Supply Chain host Brian Straight to discuss the steps his company must take before launching a drone delivery operation. Bash also addressed safety of autonomous assets, some of the regulatory red-tape autonomous providers face, and how Flytrex has been able to build collaborative relationships with the communities it operates in, providing a blueprint for successful integration and co-existence between humans and robots.  Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.
