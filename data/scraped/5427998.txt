 Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest, LinkedIn and more Sprout Social is one of the pricier plans on this list with its lowest tier starting at $249 per month. With the steeper price point comes unlimited posts and powerful data analytics tools, however, the Standard plan restricts the user to five social media sites. Sprout Social’s most popular plan is the Professional at $399 a month (billed annually). The plan allows users to post to unlimited social media sites. It includes an all-in-one social box, analysis tools for Twitter hashtags and response rate analysis reports.

 Social media management software enables users to connect multiple social media accounts and post social media content in advance to those accounts from a single interface. For example, it allows a restaurant marketing manager to schedule posts to the restaurant’s Twitter, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram accounts a week, a month or a year in advance. Social media management software typically also includes features, such as analytics tools, brand awareness campaign tools and communication tools, to help marketing departments use social media marketing campaigns to their fullest potential. It can be overwhelming determining which social media management tool is right for you because of the large number of software options available. The best way to choose the right tool for you is to start with clarifying your priorities and goals when it comes to social media. How many social media outlets can you realistically create content for on a consistent basis? How many hours per week do you want to devote to social media? How much of your budget do you want to devote to social media? Once you answer these questions, it will be easier to search through the software features that will coincide with your priorities. Your social media management tools should help you capture the eye of new followers and drive engagement with your current followers. To do this, you need to post often and know when to post at the best time. There are a few features that will help you do this: These days, most social media management software companies integrate with the top social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and LinkedIn. SocialPilot was one of the first to integrate with the popular video-sharing platform TikTok. However, slowly but surely, most of the other software platforms have as well. Not all social media management software platforms integrate with the multiplatform messaging app WhatsApp. While some platforms, such as Buffer and SproutSocial, allow users to schedule and push text, images, audio, video and PDF automatically to their customers on WhatsApp, other platforms, such as Zoho Social do not. Company size will help determine what features you need in your social media management software. For example, if you are a solopreneur in charge of managing your own Instagram and TikTok accounts, you will have much different software needs than a social media manager managing all eight separate social media platforms for 10 different brands. Solopreneurs or time-strapped marketing managers in charge of their company’s social media channels will look for a software platform that has several automation features. Automation tools help save time by scheduling posts in advance, automatically sharing new blog posts to your preferred social media platforms and customizing posts per social media platform. Along with the set-it-and-forget-it social media scheduler, an affordable price is also important for small businesses. Some social media management software, such as Buffer have a robust free plan that might be more than suitable for solopreneurs or small businesses to manage their social media accounts. Social media managers who run large accounts or those who manage accounts for several companies or brands tend to work with teams. If this is the case for you, it is important to find a social media management software that will allow team members to work together without stepping on anyone’s toes or doubling efforts. Some team collaborating features to look for when comparing social media management software are: If you are going to put time and energy into creating social media content, it is important to know if that social media content is working for you. Most social media management software include reporting and analytic tools. These tools can help you decipher your social media strategy’s return on investment. It can answer questions, such as whether it is advantageous to continue to post on Twitter, what social media post garnered the most engagement, how many followers you gain every month on Facebook and which network drove the most brand awareness for a particular product launch. Hootsuite’s reporting capabilities are some of the best on the market. The platform gives users a 360-degree view of all social networks from one dashboard where you can set performance benchmarks and monitor improvements over time. Hootsuite users can also create customizable reports, get updates on the best times to post to optimize the best results and easy-to-read graphs on how your social media channels and campaigns drive leads, conversions and sales. Sprout Social is another platform with power analytics and reporting tools. The software enables users to set certain demographic and geographic measurements to measure how their audience is engaging with their content. Sprout can monitor keywords across all social media alerting users when their name is mentioned, analyze audience growth, demographics, engagement and impressions across all social media platforms. Sprout Social even allows users to compare their social media performance to their competitor’s social media performance. Several top social media management software platforms, including the ones we outlined here, have a forever-free plan. Generally, these plans have limited features and functions. They may limit the number of social media accounts you can post to, limit the number of users allowed on your plan or restrict access to analytics. For example, Buffer’s forever-free plan allows users to schedule content on up to three social media channels. Zoho Social’s free plan is more robust, allowing users to post to seven social media channels as well as access Zoho Social’s browser extension, zShare, and the ability to add one team member to their Zoho Social Portal. While these limitations may not be an issue when you are first getting started, they can limit your ability to scale unless you upgrade to a paid plan. When signing up for a free plan, it is important to research the software’s paid plans. Do they contain the features you think you will need as you grow your business? How affordable is its basic plan versus its most expensive plan? When making a business plan for the next five years, when do you think you will need to upgrade to a paid social media management software and what software features do you think will be most important for your business? Try to find software that has a free plan for the time being, but also has paid plans that will help you meet your company’s future goals.

Buffer is one of the more affordable software platforms. Buffer’s paid plans start at $5 per month per channel and include planning and publishing tools, analytics tools, engagement tools and a landing page builder. Its most expensive plan, the Agency plan, is $100 per month for 10 channels and includes unlimited team members and clients along with draft collaboration tools. Sprout Social’s paid plans start at $249 per month for five social media channels and include an all-in-one social inbox to monitor comments across the social media channels, a social content calendar and profiles, keywords and locations monitoring. For $399 a month, its Professional plan includes unlimited social media channels, competitive reports for Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, scheduling for optimal send times, response rate and time analysis reports and more. How much you spend on your social media management software depends on how much revenue you generate from social media. If your business only posts a few times a week to a few social media channels, it might not be a smart idea to buy the most expensive plan with all the automation and analytical bells and whistles. However, if you are an e-commerce store that posts multiple times a day to multiple channels, purchasing an all-inclusive plan that will help you post at the ideal time, respond to multiple customers throughout the day and track your social media ROI is probably worth the extra money. Posting great content is just part of a cohesive social media marketing plan. Marketers must also be able to interpret the results of marketing campaigns. More advanced software plans should include features that analyze results of individual posts, suggest Twitter hashtags, track relevant social conversations and gain real-time insights from social media to make business decisions. To choose the best social media management software for this article’s ranking, Forbes Advisor compared each company based on important factors that include ease of use, cost and fees, customer support and features and functionality. We ranked each company on these factors based on a rating system, with the highest score being five out of five stars. Here’s what we looked at to compile the rankings in each category: Hootsuite, Sprout Social and Buffer are three of the top social media management tools on the market today. Hootsuite is ideal for all companies that use all social media channels while Sprout Social has great analytics features. Buffer is a great option for companies looking for an affordable social media management software. Social media management software allows users to post content in advance to various social media accounts from a single user interface (UI). Additional features, such as analytics tools, brand awareness campaign tools and communication tools, are also available, depending on the software company and plan. Social media management tools allow marketing managers, small business owners and content creators to save time by scheduling social media posts in advance to multiple accounts, view top-level metrics and generate viable leads from social media. Social media is always evolving as are the social media tools companies can use to streamline their social media workflow. New social media tools include content curation tools, social media scheduling apps, content creation tools and social media analytics tools. Managing multiple social media accounts does not have to be overwhelming. Social media management software, such as Hootsuite and Sprout Social, make managing multiple accounts easy with content creation calendars, features that help automate postings and chatbots to respond to messages. To manage a business social media account properly, you must understand the company’s brand, its target audience and its business goals for the social media account. Then, create a monthly and yearly content calendar to help achieve those business goals, post engaging content and analyze the social media metrics to determine if your content is helping you meet your business goals. Community management is using social media to build an active online community to foster brand loyalists. Managing an online community requires constant monitoring of social media channels, engagement with customers, prospects and influencers and measuring feedback.
