Mindfulness has helped me with distinguishing why I may be feeling anxious & when I need to take a break. It's also given me clarity on what my boundaries are, which makes me more confident when setting those boundaries with internal team & clients. Taking 10-20 mins of the beginning of your day to meditate has made a huge difference in my productivity & mental health. Taking nature walks in the middle of the day has helped as well! It clears my mind which helps with overall creativity & stress."   -Anonymous June 22 - How to Effectively Pitch Your Agencies Social Media Services. Register here!
