 Unfortunately, thousands of people are dealing with #layoffs this month. Some of these may even be due to automation from AI... so turn the tables on the machine. Here's a list of #AI tools that may help at each stage in your #jobsearch. ü§ì  üìó Teal: https://www.tealhq.com/ Are you stuck writing your resume? Can't figure out how to explain that great project you did that made your company millions? Teal focuses on helping you craft your experience (and other sections) by making your accomplishments sound as impressive as they truly are. It also includes a job tracker so you can stay on top of each step everywhere you apply.  üëÄ Jobscan: https://lnkd.in/eF2_a-EW This tool quickly scans your #resume for keywords that match a job description you are interested in and lets you know if you have the skills the hiring manager is looking for. It's designed to get you through the automated applicant tracking systems to at least get a human to review your application. Quite crazy to use AI to beat AI to get to a real person, but it helps.  üëª PhantomBuster https://phantombuster.com/ This tool is another way to use AI to beat AI. While it's designed for sales reps to reach prospects on LinkedIn, you can search for recruiters at companies you want to work. Then send your resume the same way sales reps send you a request for a meeting through InMail.  üêº LazyApply: https://lazyapply.com/ This tool can massively speed up the process and eliminate typing and retyping of things like the start and end dates for some company you worked for ten years ago multiple times a day when you are job hunting.  üì© Loopcv: https://www.loopcv.pro/ Once your resume is in good shape, LoopCV automates applying for jobs. It finds openings relevant to your skills and auto-applies you through emails to recruiters at target companies.  üôä Google Interview Warmup: https://lnkd.in/e9iJkiK4 Congrats if you are at the #interviewtips stage! Google developed this tool to help people practice their answers to common interview questions. You speak to your microphone and get feedback on how well you answered the question sample interview question.  ü§ñ ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com/ The AI tool everyone is talking about can suggest a resume format, list companies in your field, proofread your emails to hiring managers, and more. Remember that it's still in development and doesn't have data before 2021, so it's best as a brainstorming partner and not a replacement for your own brilliance. Plus, if you generate the same content as everyone else using it, you won't stand out in the application process.  (This is not an endorsement of these tools but a list of ideas to check out. Read the reviews and/or do a trial to understand better how they will work for you.) If you are interested in learning more about #AI or #Marketing in your search, follow me Anne Hunter for discussion and let's learn together.
