A number of Illinois consumer advocates on Thursday called for state utility companies such as Ameren Illinois, Commonwealth Edison, Peoples Gas and Nicor Gas to issue a moratorium on utility shut-offs and offer special assistance to help residents of areas ravaged by extreme summer weather. Leaders from such advocacy groups as the Citizens Utility Board (CUB), Blacks In Green (BIG), and Community Organizing & Family Issues (COFI), joined state Rep. La Shawn K. Ford in calling for the moratorium and special assistance. They remarked that even though stormy weather has passed – for now – the costs of everything are still being felt and sorted through. To that point, Gov. J.B. Pritzker earlier this month issued disaster declarations for eight Illinois counties that were hit with severe weather between June 29 and July 4 – including high winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding; the counties included were and are Cook, Coles, Edgar, Hancock, McDonough, Morgan, Sangamon, and Washington. CUB Executive Director Sarah Moskowitz noted that:

“In an emergency like this, utilities need to rise to the occasion and be good corporate citizens. These utilities are incredibly profitable, and they are currently asking for record rate increases. We’re urging them to look beyond their bottom lines and stand up for their customers.”


Rep. Ford remarked in a similar vein:

“When I speak with impacted residents, I hear how many are struggling to choose between paying their bills and putting food on the table. Especially for those who are on a fixed income or LIHEAP (Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program), we need to show compassion and come together to help get people back on their feet. A brief moratorium will go a long way in helping our neighbors.”
