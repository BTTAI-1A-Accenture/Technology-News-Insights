 Prudential’s universal life insurance policies are top-rated in our analysis thanks to strong scores for cost competitiveness and reliable policy illustrations. More: Prudential Life Insurance Review Universal life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that offers the flexibility to adjust your premium payments (within certain parameters). You can also decrease or apply to increase your death benefit. Universal life insurance also typically includes a cash value component that earns interest or other investment gains that grow tax-deferred. There are three main types of universal life insurance: The main difference in the types of universal life insurance is how cash value grows.

There are three main types of universal life insurance: A GUL policy has a death benefit and premium payments that don’t change over time. Cash value growth may be minimal, but it is usually the cheapest type of universal life insurance. IUL offers the potential to change your death benefit and premiums within certain limits. Cash value is tied to a stock market index, like the S&P 500, or a combination of indexes. Policy fees and charges are often high. A VUL policy allows you to change your death benefit and premiums within certain limits. You’ll select sub-accounts for cash value investments, which means you’ll need to actively manage this type of policy. 
 The average cost of universal life insurance is $102 a month for a $250,000 policy for a 30-year-old female and $114 a month for a 30-year-old male, according to Forbes Advisor’s analysis. If you’re shopping for a universal life policy, understanding the various factors that affect life insurance rates can help you know what to expect. It may also help you identify the best insurance company for your needs. Here are some factors insurers may consider when setting your universal life insurance rates. These factors help life insurance companies to determine your risk level. Your health, including height, weight, prescriptions, medical conditions, smoking status, substance abuse history and the health history of your parents and siblings help insurers predict your life expectancy. Your life insurance medical exam results (if required) will also be assessed. Life insurers consider infractions on your driving record, such as DUIs and reckless driving, as factors in your risk assessment. Major felonies and multiple felonies will often result in a decline. Risky hobbies like aviation and scuba diving can lead to higher rates or even a decline. Credit and public records such as bankruptcies may be considered.

Universal life insurance can last a lifetime or until you reach the maturity date specified in the policy if you make the required premium payments. Many indexed universal life policies mature when the insured reaches age 121. Universal life insurance death benefits are usually not taxable. The cash value component of a universal life policy grows tax-deferred. It is not taxable if withdrawn or borrowed, as long as it’s money that came from your premium payments. You can borrow money (or take out a policy loan) from the cash value of a universal life insurance policy. Before you do, request an in-force policy illustration to see how the life insurance policy loan will impact the policy. The two main differences between universal life and term life insurance are the policy durations and the cash value component. Universal life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance intended to last a lifetime. Term life insurance has a specified end date, after which you can renew the policy, but at higher rates each year. Universal life insurance offers a cash value component; term life insurance does not.
