(TSX: CCA) ("Cogeco Communications" or the "Corporation") announced its financial results for the second quarter ended February 28, 2023. "Our overall operating strategies proved to be effective in the context of more challenging economic and competitive environments," said Philippe Jetté, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cogeco Communications Inc. "Our Canadian telecommunications business unit performed well in the quarter, which was marked by continued organic growth in our Internet customer base, both in our traditional markets and in our newly served areas, resulting in growing adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins," continued Mr. Jetté. "In addition, the acquisition in March of the telecommunications operations of oxio is a great addition to our service offering and brings a second brand to serve the telecommunications needs of Canadians." "With respect to our U.S. telecommunications business, we have grown our customer base outside our newly acquired Ohio footprint, both in our current and newly served areas," added Mr. Jetté. "In Ohio, we continued our commercial integration activities while enhancing our product line by making our IPTV product available to all our customers, setting the foundation for future growth. Our progress and marketing efforts have paid off, with Internet customer metrics improving over previous quarters." "I am pleased to highlight that we recently published our annual ESG and Sustainability Report as well as our Climate Action Plan, in which we respectively provide an update of our environmental, social and governance commitments, initiatives and performance and outline the key steps we are taking in support of urgent climate action," continued Mr. Jetté. "We are also very proud to be, for the fourth consecutive year, ranked among the 100 most sustainable companies in the world by Corporate Knights, a highly-regarded global ranking of companies that are leading the way in making the world a better place," concluded Mr. Jetté.

Forward-looking statements  Certain statements contained in this press release may constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Forward-looking information may relate to Cogeco Communications Inc.'s ("Cogeco Communications" or the "Corporation") future outlook and anticipated events, business, operations, financial performance, financial condition or results and, in some cases, can be identified by terminology such as "may"; "will"; "should"; "expect"; "plan"; "anticipate"; "believe"; "intend"; "estimate"; "predict"; "potential"; "continue"; "foresee", "ensure" or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Particularly, statements regarding the Corporation's financial guidelines, future operating results and economic performance, objectives and strategies are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on certain factors and assumptions including expected growth, results of operations, purchase price allocation, tax rates, weighted average cost of capital, performance and business prospects and opportunities, which Cogeco Communications believes are reasonable as of the current date. Refer in particular to the "Corporate objectives and strategies" section of the Corporation's 2022 annual MD&A and of the fiscal 2023 second-quarter MD&A, the "Fiscal 2023 financial guidelines" section of the Corporation's 2022 annual MD&A and the "Fiscal 2023 revised financial guidelines" of the fiscal 2023 first-quarter MD&A for a discussion of certain key economic, market and operational assumptions we have made in preparing forward-looking statements. While management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to the Corporation, they may prove to be incorrect. Forward-looking information is also subject to certain factors, including risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what Cogeco Communications currently expects. These factors include risks such as competitive risks (including changing competitive ecosystems and disruptive competitive strategies adopted by our competitors), business risks (including potential disruption to our supply chain caused by economic and geopolitical instability and other contributing factors, increasing transportation lead times, scarcity and shortages of input materials and key telecommunication equipment and competition for limited resources), regulatory risks , technology risks (including cybersecurity), financial risks (including variations in currency and interest rates), economic conditions (including inflation pressuring revenue, reduced consumer spending and increasing costs), human-caused and natural threats to our network (including increased frequency of extreme weather events with the potential to disrupt operations), infrastructure and systems, community acceptance risks, ethical behavior risks, ownership risks, litigation risks and public health and safety, many of which are beyond the Corporation's control. For more exhaustive information on these risks and uncertainties, the reader should refer to the "Uncertainties and main risk factors" sections of the Corporation's 2022 annual MD&A and of the fiscal 2023 second-quarter MD&A. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Cogeco Communications and future events and results may vary significantly from what management currently foresees.

While management may elect to do so, the Corporation is under no obligation (and expressly disclaims any such obligation) and does not undertake to update or alter this information at any particular time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.  All amounts are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.
