Smart home technology can be fun and convenient, but it can also save lives, property, and a lifetime of memories. These days, powerful security cameras, dependable Wi-Fi networking, and straight-to-consumer home security systems are more reliable, available, and affordable than ever. Coupled with constantly refined smart home devices, now's a better time than ever to protect your loved ones and belongings from emergencies.
                         But how do you choose? Some smart home security systems come from well-known brands with trusted products and services, often including professional monitoring services to ensure nothing gets past your first line of defense. Others are slightly less comprehensive but deliver peace of mind with long-range motion sensors and Internet-connected notification systems. This list includes the latter and everything in between so you can make the best choice for your home.
     Impressive reliability Ring security devices, particularly the Ring Alarm Pro, are popular because of their compact, affordable, and reliable design. They feature an integrated Eero router, battery backup, professional monitoring, and Edge encryption for video data protection. Advanced features include Alexa Guard Plus and Amazon Echo-based services. However, initial software installation can be cumbersome, and features may lack some user-friendly explanations.                      Ring security devices, especially the Ring Alarm Pro, are incredibly popular for a few good reasons. They're compact, reasonably priced, and, most importantly, as refined and dependable as smart home electronics can hope to be. In the case of the Alarm Pro system, that's due partly to an integrated Eero router that ensures practically plug-and-play installation in addition to backup internet access should your home Wi-Fi connection ever go down. There's also a built-in battery backup in case of a complete power failure.
                         You can (and, if you want peak protection, should) sign up for Ring's professional monitoring plan, but you also have the option of local storage. Speaking of storage, Ring now uses a proprietary encryption feature called Edge to secure video data, so you don't have to worry about bad actors gaining access to live or saved feeds. Ring security also has some interesting, advanced features that are nice to have. One is Alexa Guard Plus, an Amazon Echo-based service that listens for sounds like breaking glass and smoke detectors to ensure no alarms go unnoticed.
                         There are a few drawbacks to the Ring Alarm Pro. If we had to pick a couple, the first-time software installation is somewhat cumbersome since you'll need to set up three separate apps to configure the entire system. There's also a bit of a lack of in-depth, user-friendly explanations for some of the more complex features. But these minor issues shouldn't affect the day-to-day use of a great home security system.
     A group of top-of-the-line products For comprehensive home security, Arlo is the complete package. Its 22-piece set includes everything from the all-important keypad hub right down to the yard signs. Aside from the hardware, this system is bolstered with professional monitoring.                      Why make sacrifices in your smart home security system? Turns out, with the Arlo Total Security Advanced with Video package, you don't have to. This system, while priced at a premium compared to our other picks, leaves little to be desired. It keeps eyes on the driveway, yard, and front door with its three included Arlo Pro 5S 2K cameras — and these cameras' benefits should not be understated; they feature color night vision, HDR video, and an extra-long battery life. Plus, this package includes three anti-theft mounts to keep each camera secure, four batteries to ensure all cameras can have a charged battery available, and a dual battery station for convenient charging.
                         We consider Arlo's All-in-One Sensors to be some of the best smart home sensors you can currently buy, and the Total Security Advanced with Video comes with a whopping ten of those bad boys. They detect opened windows and doors, smoke, carbon dioxide, and more. This system's perks don't just hide in the hardware, though. Arlo's top-shelf plan offers AI-powered intelligent motion discernment, 24/7 professional monitoring, and a month of cloud-based video storage.
     Basic starter kit Wyze home security systems are dependable, affordable solutions. The Core Kit includes a hub, keypad, motion sensor, entry sensors, and various cameras. The professional monitoring service costs $10 monthly, with a year-long subscription saving $20. However, it lacks smart home device integration and requires professional monitoring for most functions.                      Assembling a security system piece by piece ensures that you get exactly what you need. That concept, plus a remarkably low price, is one of the biggest selling points behind Wyze's home security systems. The Core Kit we've highlighted includes the most basic components: a hub, keypad, motion sensor, and two entry sensors. Of course, you're not limited to just those devices, thanks to the variety of Wyze security cameras (indoor and outdoor, wired and wireless) and its selection of climate and leak sensors.
                         The professional monitoring service costs about $10 per month with no contract required, and you can save $20 on a year-long subscription. The Core Kit comes with three months of free monitoring, making it an even better deal than at first glance. Remember, if you decide to add some Wyze cameras, cloud video storage is still an additional charge.
                         While the Wyze system is the best basic and affordable choice, it has minor drawbacks. It doesn't offer much integration with general smart home devices and lacks advanced features such as cellular internet backup. Also, while the professional monitoring service isn't strictly required to use the hardware, you won't be able to access most functions without it. But it's hard to beat Wyze home security if you're looking for something dependable, affordable, and easy to use.
     Wide device compatibility The Abode home security system is compatible with smart devices like Sonos and Bose and features integrated Zigbee and Z-Wave radios. It offers high-end features like battery backup and a fallback cellular connection. While not perfect, it provides reliable and expandable security for those with a blend of security equipment.                      One of the most interesting things about the Abode home security system is how well it works with various smart devices from other manufacturers. Not only is it directly compatible with brands like Sonos and Bose (which most security systems aren't), but it even sports integrated Zigbee and Z-Wave radios that enable the use of many specialized devices. So, if you already have smart locks, garage door openers, leak sensors, or similar, you can merge control of almost everything underneath the Abode app. Unlike many others, it's pretty useful even if you don't initially opt for the subscription plan. And if you're on the fence about said subscription, there are two tiers to choose from, and you don't have to commit to a contract.
                         The Adobe eight-piece system is a good choice for larger homes; its multiple sensors and broad smart device compatibility ensure consistent coverage for three-plus bedroom homes. It also sports some of the most useful high-end features, including battery backup and a fallback cellular connection in case your home internet goes down (although that requires a top-level monitoring plan). So if you already have a good deal of security equipment but want to tie it all together, Abode is a great choice. It's not perfect, though. Abode's cameras aren't anything to write home about, although the best ones offer decent image quality at a price. Also, the sensors are pretty bulky, and the most effective subscription plan isn't exactly cheap. However, anyone willing to invest will likely be happy with the reliability and expandability.
     Ultimate customizability, no monthly fee SimpliSafe security systems, developed just a decade ago, are effective and user-friendly. A 9-piece kit includes four-door and window sensors, motion detectors, a keypad, and a wired camera. Add-ons like dedicated sensors and smart door locks provide more control. Although not the most affordable option, it remains a reliable midrange selection with many customizable options.                      SimpliSafe security systems were at the very forefront of home security solutions just under a decade ago, and the latest versions remain effective and user-friendly despite having far more competition in the past. Its 9-piece kit includes four door and window entry sensors, two motion detectors, a keypad, one wired camera, and the hub needed to connect everything. It's enough for small family homes, and many add-ons are also offered. You can, for example, pick up dedicated sensors that constantly check for leaks, breaking glass, or temperature and humidity. You can also integrate the SimpliSafe smart door lock for added control and peace of mind.
                         Aside from the relative ease of installation and system setup, SimpliSafe builds high-quality components. In particular, the outdoor security camera provides high-resolution recording, two-way talk, and a built-in spotlight and siren, making it a basically all-in-one addition to the front lines of home security.
                         There are a few negatives to be aware of, though, such as the doorbell's less-than-stellar field of view and lack of battery power. And while SimpliSafe's pro-monitoring service isn't absurdly expensive, it's far from the most affordable. Still, it is a tried-and-true midrange option from a company that's been around for a while and staked much of its reputation on dependable home security devices.
     Still high competition The second-generation Ring Alarm offers similar features as the Ring Alarm Pro but is less expensive. It features an integrated Wi-Fi 6 router and 4G modem for power outages, ensuring security until the lights return. The basic Ring Alarm has all the necessary features, including Google Assistant and IFTTT programming compatibility.                      The second-generation Ring Alarm has nearly all the same features as the Ring Alarm Pro but costs a decent amount less. The only major difference is that the Pro version has an integrated Wi-Fi 6 router and 4G modem, which take over during a power outage, so you don't lose your security system until the lights come back on.
     Don't break the bank with expensive alarms when Ring's got you covered!                      If you're not concerned about that specific issue, there's little reason to opt for the more expensive setup. Otherwise, the basic Ring Alarm has everything most homeowners will need, including recently upgraded compatibility with Google Assistant and IFTTT programming.
     Specially curated devices The Ecobee Home Security Bundle has reliable devices that monitor doors, windows, breezeways, and hallways. It lacks a keypad and uses a mobile device to notify the network and smart camera controller of the user's home. Ecobee's setup and management procedures make configuring individual parts easier than installing a bulky system.                      Rather than a cohesive, walled garden of branded security system components, the Ecobee Home Security Bundle comprises several highly reliable devices that keep your doors, windows, breezeways, and hallways monitored at all times. The lack of a keypad is the most noticeable difference between Ecobee's bundle and a bona fide security system.
                         Instead, your mobile device lets the network and smart camera controller know you're home automatically, so you don't have to run to the panel and enter a code. Plus, while the essentially piecemeal configuration might sound a little more complicated on the surface, Ecobee does such a good job with setup and management procedures that you might even find configuring the parts individually easier than installing a bulky, complicated system all at once.
     Leave the safeguarding to the experts Self-monitoring is an automatic component of most smart home security systems, but some shoppers may just want to install the security devices and trust the rest to the experts. ADT Self Setup lets you do the installation, with the option to hand monitoring duties over to the longtime experts at ADT, who are some of the most established security experts in the game.                      There are plenty of reasons to opt for a self-monitored system. You save some money, and you don't have to worry about false alarms wasting the time and resources of your security company's monitoring professionals and law enforcement. On the other hand, professionally monitored systems offer a lot of peace of mind, especially for homeowners who do a lot of traveling, have young children in the home, or live in areas with concerning property-related crime rates.
                         Since ADT Self Setup uses Google Nest smart home devices, shoppers will reap the benefit of Google's smart home features, such as intelligent motion detection and Google Home integration. This does, unfortunately, mean that if you are already using a different smart home ecosystem, such as Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, or Apple HomeKit, you might see some hiccups in integration.
     A comprehensive white-glove experience Vivint is a trusted name in home security with a dynamic product range, affordable monthly subscription options, and equipment financing. Its equipment integrates with Google or Amazon smart home ecosystems, which in turn help support Vivint's smart automation and monitoring functions.                      Do-it-yourself installation may be a growing trend in home security, but if you want or need the assistance of a dedicated home security technician, Vivint offers professional installation. While this typically bumps the price up a bit compared to competing systems, installation by a competent professional offers peace of mind — and keeps frustration to a minimum.
                         Vivint systems come custom-tailored to the unique needs of your home. Add on as many entry sensors, flood detectors, or security cameras as you'd like — and also take advantage of additional smart components like Vivint's smart thermostat, smart garage door controller, and smart hub. Vivint is, overall, a very hands-on security company; professional monitoring is a feature of all security plans, which offers 24/7 expert response to any security threat.
     A scalable system featuring cellular backup and battery backup The Iota smart hub is the star of this premium kit from Abode. It features an onboard HD camera and siren, plus two-way voice connectivity. This kit offers 4G cellular connectivity when the Wi-Fi breaks up, while a battery backup keeps important devices up and running in a power outage. Abode's all-in-one Iota kit also includes a key fob and one door/window entry sensor.                      Apple HomeKit users are still disappointed time and time again when shopping for compatible smart home products. For all the Apple loyalists used to being told no, the Abode Iota All-in-One Security Kit is a solid option. It integrates with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and, yes, even Apple HomeKit. It's a smaller kit, meant to lay the groundwork for a bigger system, but the Iota smart hub is a fantastic place to start. It includes its own built-in camera, plus a 93db siren to scare the daylights out of intruders. The hub also features a cellular and battery backup to keep the system running even during unexpected outages.
                         There are larger Iota kits available if you're looking for a larger scale right off the bat; the Iota hub comes in six- or eight-piece bundles, integrating a range of peripherals such as a keypad, more entry sensors, and glass breakage sensors.
     For a Google-friendly smart home, stick to the brand's own The Google Nest Total Security Package may be a pretty small group, but these three devices pack a mighty punch. First, there's the smart hub, the brains of the system. There's also a battery-powered Nest Cam security camera for convenient installation indoors or out. Lastly, the kit features a Nest Video Doorbell for keeping eyes on the front door.                      For homeowners with existing smart home systems, finding a security package that integrates with your chosen smart assistant is a must. While all options on this list report being compatible with Google Assistant, using Google's own security devices will ensure the smoothest transition. The Total Security Package includes three components: a smart hub, an indoor/outdoor camera, and a doorbell.
                         One caveat we see to the Total Security Package is that Google Nest users are likely to have a smart hub, rendering one-third of this kit redundant. For its price, we'd also like to see at least a couple of sensors or a peripheral support product like a keypad included, but Google's security devices are rich with smart features, including intelligent motion detection and remote control via the Google apps.
                         Wading through generic, off-brand security systems is a little disheartening because there are tons. While they'll save you money upfront, it's not worth trusting the safety of your home, family, and belongings to something with no brand reputation or responsibility behind it. That's why you'll find primarily well-known brands on our short list of the top smart home security systems.
                         It's also worth mentioning that the definition of a "smart" home security system varies among users and manufacturers. Some can respond to voice commands to enable, disable, or offer minimal control over some components, but that's as far as they go. Others, like the Abode Starter Kit, are great for homes with many smart devices. Many high-end options also come with indoor security cameras as a bundle.
                         The Ring Alarm Pro is a well-rounded choice for most smart homers, thanks partly to the integrated Wi-Fi 6 router and Z-Wave radio. Unsurprisingly, it got high marks, including the AndroidPolice Editor's Choice award. Its user-friendly configuration, impressive feature set, unmatched performance, and long-term reliability make it the best choice for people who can afford it and are comfortable with Amazon's ecosystem. But if you're not very concerned about power outages and already have a robust, well-managed Wi-Fi network, the base model Ring alarm offers the same functionality at a notably lower price.
                         While it's a decent chunk of change to invest in one, the Arlo Total Security Advanced home security system with video leaves no corner of the exterior home without surveillance. Capitalizing on Arlo's outstanding night vision and super-long battery life, porch pirates, nosy solicitors, and other unfriendlies are no match for the premium pick system. The 22-piece set includes ten entry sensors, so you'll know when a door or window is opened at odd hours or even left open for a long period. As a plus, this top-tier Arlo package comes with professional monitoring, so you can add expert monitoring to keep your home safe.
                         Wyze is another big name in smart devices that gets a lot of press and for good reason. More so than most competitors, Wyze security products are remarkably affordable (especially considering how well they work) and let you order exactly the components you need — no more and no less. Wyze's Core Kit is a great choice for those taking advantage of its standalone security cameras (just not the first-generation Wyze Cam, which is now discontinued) and want to take the next step to live professional monitoring. In the case of Wyze, it's worth noting that you'll miss out on many features without the ongoing subscription plan, but that's true of many competitors to some degree.
     Number one pick The Ring Alarm Pro is the best smart home security system money can buy, and users will not be disappointed with the available features and functions. This compact, affordable, and reliable setup brings peace of mind. With battery backup, professional monitoring, and advanced services, the Ring Alarm Pro is an all-around premium system for any home.
