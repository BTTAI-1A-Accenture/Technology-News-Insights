Share There are two ways to approach pairing a Martini with food, and Mitch Orr â chef at woodfired Sydney restaurant Kiln â says you can subscribe to both. The first is more traditional. âIf youâre pairing food with a drink, the aim should always be to create a harmony between the two that makes them greater together,â he says. âWhether thatâs because they complement each other so well or because the contrast livens everything up.â  The second approach is less prescriptive. âHonestly, you donât need an excuse to drink a Martini â it goes with everything,â says Orr. âMy motto is always eat what you want to eat and drink what you want to drink. Who cares if theyâre supposed to pair if you love it?â  If you fall more in the intentional-pairing camp, thereâs good news: Orr has designed a salty, umami-laden snack to serve at Kiln that is specially tailored to the Martini recipe below, and an ideal delicacy to indulge in during the Four Pillars Martini Collective, which is taking place across Sydney this May. While you could match the dish with a generic Martini, Four Pillars recipe is built around the finer points of its Olive Leaf Gin. âLemon myrtle brings those citrusy floral notes,â says Orr. âDistilling with layers of extra-virgin olive oil and the olive leaf adds savoury and umami [flavours], rounded out with the earthy nuttiness of macadamia.â  Never miss a Sydney moment.

The snack in question is a fried oyster with kombu butter that both complements and contrasts with the Olive Leaf Martini. âThe elements that come into play are those subtle botanicals of the olive leaf and lemon, as well as the umami and almost oceanic savouriness of the gin,â says Orr. âThe Martini is so crisp and clean that it will cut through the richness of the fried oyster and kombu butter, lifting and lightening. At the same time, in my mind, the oyster dirties up the Martini a little.â  If you want to check out how the fried oyster and Martini match works yourself, youâll find both at Kiln during the month of May. The bar is open late every night and DJs are on hand from 8pm on Friday and Saturday nights â so itâs a good spot to turn your snack tasting into a night out. Alongside Kiln, a bunch of Sydneyâs best bars and restaurantsâ including Albertoâs, Icebergs, Bistecca, The Gidley, Rekodo, Saint Peter and the Four Pillars Laboratory â will be serving up a Four Pillars Olive Leaf Gin Martini with their own hand-picked snacks.  However, if youâre making and matching the Four Pillars Olive Leaf Gin Mini Martini at home, Orr has one last piece of advice: âA Martini absolutely has to be ice cold.â  Recipe: Four Pillars Olive Leaf Gin Mini Martini
