The group have performed to sell-out audiences on their G4 Christmas tours in Manchester for the last 7 years, and are thrilled to be bringing their G4 LIVE tour to the area this year! You can see this vocal spectacular at Stockport Plaza on June 24. G4 set an exciting trend by bringing classical music to British reality TV screens for the first time in 2004 with their performance of Nessun Dorma. However, it was their cover of Bohemian Rhapsody that became their signature tune, storming the charts in 2005.  Their eponymous debut album went straight to number 1, selling more than 245,000 in the first week, making it the fastest-selling album of the year.  G4 subsequently released three albums, selling over 2 million copies in the UK. They also released a “Live at The Royal Albert Hall” DVD, an autobiographical book “G4: Our Way” and completed five sell-out tours across the UK and Ireland, including a Cathedral Tour where they sang acoustically.  Other G4 highlights included collaborating with Lesley Garrett, Robin Gibb, Stephen Gately and Sir Cliff Richard, performing in The Royal Albert Hall more than a dozen times. In 2024, the group have big plans, with a new studio album (G4 20) to mark 20 years since first appearing on the X Factor, followed by a large UK tour.
