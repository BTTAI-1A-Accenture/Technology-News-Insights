 Modern cyber threats require dynamic and evolving security countermeasures, especially regarding authentication. So, I thought to explore the concept of adaptive authentication in this post. Adaptive authentication is a dynamic (yes!), risk-based approach to authentication that can use real-time information to guard against system breaches. Sounds like it is the "perfect" solution, doesn't it? Well, it depends. Read on. Classical definition aside, adaptive authentication is an approach to identity verification that relies on risk assessments of users and their activity to determine whether or not to allow access. Furthermore, adaptive authentication enables systems to dynamically assign specific types of authentication to users based on several criteria to increase security based on real-time events. That last part is so important: whats happening in real-time is the key! The goal? To address the ever-evolving challenges to identity fraud and authentication that can threaten sensitive IT systems. In many contexts, authentication is seen as a one-time activity–the user seeks to enter a system or a sub-system, and the security infrastructure requires that users provide credentials to identify themselves. There are some limitations to this approach, though. For example, if an employee’s work credentials are stolen due to a phishing attack, then any authentication requirements will prove primarily useless. Adaptive authentication attempts to solve this problem by addressing some of the limitations of traditional authentication through a specific set of features: Risk Profiles: Adaptive authentication relies on evaluating risk in a system and applying criteria to that risk to determine authentication results. In extremely simplistic authentication schemes, the system may assign different access requests with high, medium, or low-risk profiles based on specific criteria.  Based on these profiles, the authentication system may require different verification forms (biometrics, PINs, etc.) or automatically reject the request. Real-Time Assessments: These risk profiles and evaluations are conducted in real-time. That is, there isn’t a straightforward approach to risk that relies on a prior knowledge of an account or user. Instead, the system can compile information regarding risk categories and apply them to specific user requests as they happen. Of course, it is imperative that the assessments completely quickly in order to minimize any impact to the user experience! Automated Decision-Making: To build more sophisticated authentication systems, risk-based systems will use machine learning and AI to monitor user and system activity to apply risk profiles dynamically. AI can learn from these activities and risk profiles and more effectively and securely apply different authentication requirements to specific requests- if not outright denying them due to risk. This predictive methodology learns while "online" wherein the current real-time context is fed to the model, which updates its risk parameters accordingly, for a future access attempt. Trust: Trust is a significant factor in adaptive authentication- by assuming different levels of risk, an organization can then define who they trust and how they develop that trust. Furthermore, zero-trust security schemes can leverage adaptive authentication to strengthen their underlying security without relying entirely on standard authentication. To summarize, adaptive authentication is a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to identity verification that addresses some of the limitations of traditional and multi-factor authentication. Adaptive authentication can use several approaches to monitoring and identifying risk in an authentication system. These approaches provide sufficient information to provide any risk-scanning or AI systems to decide how, or even if, to allow users to authenticate themselves. Some of these factors include: Location: If a user attempts to access system resources from a specific city, state, or country, then risk-based authentication can take steps to require additional identification factors to mitigate fraud. Once the user is verified, the system can include their location information in a directory of accepted locations for authentication. Behaviors: Dynamic systems can monitor user behavior, including purchases made, files or resources accessed, or login attempts to influence risk profiles. If a user’s account behaves in ways that align with fraudulent activities, the system can automatically require additional authentication or outright reject the user’s access. Of course, we must obtain the user's consent before collecting any of their transactional data for analytics. Attributes: Attributes are more static than dynamic and require administrators to set policies around account information. These attributes can include roles, permissions, or devices used to attempt access. Risk: The authentication system can combine the above-listed criteria with the sensitivity of the resource being accessed to determine specific risk attributes used to specify authentication requirements. Based on applying these risk factors (and upon deciding regarding risk and authentication), an adaptive authentication system can apply different factors or authentication not only to a specific user, but to a user based on the actual request being made. Low Risk: If a user has previously authenticated with the system, it may consider their following verifications as low risk. For example, suppose the user has verified and authenticated a device like a work laptop, and they attempt to access system resources using that laptop. In that case, the system may only require a PIN or password. Medium Risk: Suppose the system determines that the user request poses a moderate risk. In that case, however, the authentication system may require some factor of MFA in the form of a biometric scan or a one-time password over SMS. High Risk: The system picks up on a user account, raising red flags–this could mean a combination of repeated bad authentication attempts, changes to core account information, or account access from a non-standard IP address or geographic location. Configurable Risk: I call this the Bring Your Own Risk Posture (BYORp). Oh c'mon, let's start the year with a new acronym! Anyway, so this has to do with allowing an access administrator to derive the risk inherent in the access attempt without having any (or only a little) preconceived notion of that risk. Based on the probabilistic determination of the risk, the system allows or denies or generates "advice" on how to proceed: step-up the authentication via multi-factor authentication, introduce a delay on purpose, deny the access, etc. The system is empowered to read any of these activities as signs of fraud and deny further authentication from that account. Follow-up action might include direct contact with the user, a reset of login credentials, and verification of MFA. In any of these cases, the utility of adaptive authentication is in assessing these factors and providing appropriate security measures. Any evolution in security technology will come with some benefits, and adaptive authentication is no different. Specifically, adaptive authentication provides a level of flexibility and adaptability that can only be achieved through intelligent, risk-based security systems. Some of the key benefits of adaptive authentication include Friction-less Authentication: Adaptive authentication can provide organizations with a way to streamline identity verification for trusted users and devices. While this approach might throw up more challenges for non-standard or unrecognized devices or user variables, it also allows for streamlined authentication for trusted users. Sophisticated Risk Management: With a smart risk assessment system (and even some AI capabilities), adaptive authentication provides a more sophisticated approach to resource access versus static policies and complex, role-based schemes. Up-to-Date Security Policies: Adaptive authentication can better adjust to a shifting security landscape. Instead of building new security policies and access schemes, this approach can better adjust to new vulnerabilities or attacks based on behavioral criteria. Easy Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): Smart adaptive systems can adjust to different devices, applying new and evolving policies around mobile, desktop, and IoT devices seeking access to network resources. Following that, the system can apply different levels of security to each to ensure secure access. In conclusion, it is evident that in order to bolster a comprehensive authentication scheme that relies on adaptive authentication, you need a foundation of features that you can deploy based on assessed security risks. Strong MFA, biometrics, passwordless security, and decentralized identity management allow an adaptive system to utilize different levels of risk-based authentication security.  Product Manager | Mentoring Aspiring PMs | Generative AI | Security and Trust | Authentication Javed S. This is super insightful. Despite the enormous benefits of adaptive authentication, what are some concerns you think companies have when evaluating Adaptive Auth solutions? Is it effort of deployment, trust in the technology, accuracy of risk score or cost of MFA methods? CEO, Entrepreneur, Investor, Advisor, Board Member Javed S. - This is so spot on. Risk Based Adaptive Authentication that is context aware is so critical in rolling out "Logging In" options to be much more secure with least amount of friction....
