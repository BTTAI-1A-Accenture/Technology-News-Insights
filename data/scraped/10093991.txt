Tensions arise from the conflict between the SEC, Binance, and Coinbase, while concerns regarding inflation and central bank hawkishness add to the market unease. Despite these factors, BTC has demonstrated resilience by remaining above the $26,000 threshold in recent days. If it can successfully breach the resistance at $26,750, a substantial increase in its value may be observed. Moreover, surpassing the next significant resistance at approximately $27,000 could propel the price even higher. On the downside, the current support level is at $25,400.” Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead, CoinSwitch Ventures, said, “Crypto markets have traded sideways in the last 24 hours. The global crypto market capitalization is at $1.14 trillion, with a slight decline of 0.1 per cent since yesterday. The crypto fear and greed index continues to maintain yesterday’s position right in the middle of the scale with 50 points.” Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX, offered his take, "Bitcoin price fluctuation continues amidst the SEC’s crackdown on Crypto exchanges. The ecosystem anticipates more rules to be imposed on the industry. Bitcoin’s moving averages and market oscillators indicate a strong ‘Sell’ sentiment." Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder, Unocoin said, “Ether held its position at $1,842 , signaling stability in Bitcoin's downtrend. Notably, the tokens mentioned in the SEC lawsuits saw a smaller recovery, with BNB up 0.49 percent and ADA, SOL, and MATIC seeing a Minor dip. Bitcoin remains resilient despite recent SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, along with inflation and central bank concerns. It hovers around $26,300 seemingly untouched by regulatory action. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler delivers a resolute message in which he argues that the appeal of an additional instrument cannot exempt crypto assets from the securities categorisation.” Shivam Thakral, the CEO of BuyUCoin, said, “The US SEC action on crypto firms has not impacted BTC prices in a big way as the world’s largest crypto holds strong above the $26,000 mark. The largest altcoin, ETH, also remains resilient and did not slide further in the last 24 hours which is mainly due to optimism around Fed’s monetary policy decision which is due next week. There is a sense in the market that Fed may relax its hawkish stance to boost market liquidity.”  CoinDCX Research Team told ABP Live, “The crypto market has experienced volatility this week, with Bitcoin and Ethereum trading around $26,400 and $1,840, respectively. A fascinating trend has emerged in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score, as major whales with over 10,000 BTC continue to accumulate aggressively, while other significant groups are witnessing substantial distribution. On the other hand, Web3 initiatives in Asian countries have started reflecting. On-chain data indicates that Asia has surpassed the United States in terms of active capital in Bitcoin and crypto markets.” Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: https://t.me/officialabplive Disclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.
