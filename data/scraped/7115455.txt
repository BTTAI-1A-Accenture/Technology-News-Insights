With a track record of low complaints and a large selection of other business coverages, Travelers is worth consideration. Commercial car insurance is a form of small business insurance for work vehicles. If you drive a car, truck or van for business purposes, you’ll need a commercial auto policy. Your personal car insurance likely won’t cover the vehicle if you (or an employee) get into an accident while driving for business. Commercial auto insurance can cover everything from company cars to food trucks to delivery vans. Here’s a look at the types of coverage available with commercial auto insurance: If you are driving a vehicle for business purposes, you will need commercial auto insurance. Your personal car insurance policy won’t pay a claim if you get into an accident while driving your car for work. Here are some examples when you need a commercial auto insurance policy: Related: How commercial auto insurance works The average cost of commercial auto insurance is $147 per month, according to Insureon. More than a third (37%) of Insureon customers pay less than $100 per month, about a quarter (26%) pay between $100 and $200 per month and 37% pay more than $200 per month for commercial auto insurance. Here’s a look at the pricing factors for commercial auto insurance. If you have a business vehicle that you rent or a personal car that you sometimes use for business-related work, the vehicle won’t be covered by a commercial auto policy. But you can find coverage with “hired and non-owned auto insurance.” Let’s say you’re driving your personal car to a business meeting and get into a car wreck. You’re at fault in the accident, and the other driver decides to sue your business. Hired and non-owned auto insurance would help cover these legal fees. If you’re a driver for Uber, Lyft or another rideshare service, you may wish to get additional insurance protection with rideshare insurance. Relying on a personal auto policy and the rideshare company’s insurance can leave a coverage gap. For example, there is a gap in insurance coverage when a driver has the rideshare company’s app on but is still waiting for a passenger request. The driver won’t be covered by comprehensive and collision insurance from either their personal auto policy or the insurance offered by the rideshare company’s coverage. Getting rideshare insurance fills this gap in coverage. Below is a ranking of the largest sellers of commercial auto insurance. We evaluated 28 companies based on commercial auto insurance complaints made to state regulators in 2021, using data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. With so many choices for car insurance companies, it can be hard to know where to start to find the right car insurance. We've evaluated insurers to find the best car insurance companies, so you don't have to.   





























 
				Business Insurance Made Simple
			 Commercial auto insurance generally covers work vehicles that are owned, rented or leased by a business and used for work-related purposes, such as delivering goods and transporting tools and equipment. This includes vehicles such as cars, box trucks, pickup trucks, dump trucks, food trucks, vans, funeral home vehicles and courtesy vehicles for repair shops. Commercial auto insurance typically costs more than personal auto insurance because insurance companies generally see driving for work-related purposes as riskier than driving for personal use. For example, a business consultant who drives to meet with several clients every week is more likely to have an accident compared to someone who drives to work once a day.   The best way to find a good price on commercial auto insurance is to shop around for quotes. It’s a good idea to get commercial auto insurance quotes from several different insurers. Commercial auto insurance is intended specifically for vehicles used for business purposes. Because of the extra risks associated with business use, commercial car insurance is generally more expensive than a comparable personal auto policy.   You’ll find business-specific coverage options and sometimes discounts for using a telematics program to track your fleet of vehicles.
