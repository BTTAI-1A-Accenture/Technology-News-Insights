MARKETING-INTERACTIVE has reached out to TikTok for more information.  The new hires come as TikTok faces a ban in the US largely due to national security concerns regarding ByteDance, which is TikTok's parent company that is based in China. The US fears that the Chinese government may be able to use TikTok to access US user data and the devices. It is also afraid that the Chinese government could use the social media app to spread propaganda to its US audience. To solve this, federal officials demanded that ByteDance sell its stake in TikTok or risk a US ban of the app. More US senators are also backing a bipartisan legislation to give President Joe Biden new powers to ban TikTok on national security grounds, according to Reuters. Since the news of concerns, fears have spread globally with more governments taking action to secure their data against Beijing-headquartered company ByteDance. So far, TikTok has already been banned or restricted from government-issued devices in Singapore, United States (US), Canada and Belgium. The five-hour long hearing was an opportunity for Chew to appeal to US lawmakers to reassure them that TikTok will not be selling data to the Chinese government. In his statements, Chew assured Congress that Bytedance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government and it has not requested or accessed US user data. Chew also defended the company’s US$1.5 billion Project Texas plan which involves ringfencing US data into a separate division of the company, Oracle, so that all data remains stored in the US.  Chew added that TikTok is headquartered in Singapore and Los Angeles, and that it does not operate in China. Furthermore, Chew defended TikTok's supposed negative effect on young users. He argued that as a father of two himself, much has been done to protect children on the app such as putting in age-appropriate settings and controls. He added that users under 13 cannot post videos, comment or message others and that accounts of those under 16 are automatically set to private and that they cannot send direct messages or livestream till they are above 18. There is also a new 60-minute default daily time limit for those under 18. Now, the world waits as lawmakers deliberate.
