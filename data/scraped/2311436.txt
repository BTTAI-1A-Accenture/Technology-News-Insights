			Trending:		 SAN JOSE — A big Midwest energy company has grabbed a prime plot of empty downtown San Jose land where it plans a new power hub that’s part of a sweeping revamp of Silicon Valley’s electrical grid.The property purchase occurred in the wake of a March decision by the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to select LS Power as the developer, owner and operator of two massive new Bay Area projects to bolster electricity reliability in California.“We’re excited to be taking this major step forward on our recently awarded project,” said Casey Carroll, a vice president with LS Power Grid California.Both projects would create substantial new electricity transmission systems involving four facilities in and next to the South Bay.One project involves the creation of a 500-megawatt transmission line and other facilities between and next to the Metcalf substation in South San Jose and PG&E San Jose Station B, which is the substation that’s next to the downtown San Jose property that LS Power has just bought.“The ISO estimates that the proposed (Metcalf-San Jose) project will approximately cost $525 million to $615 million,” the Independent System Operator stated in the 2022 report. CAISO also set a June 2028 date for this project to be up and running.A vacant land site near the corner of Ryland Street and Santa Teresa Street just south of Coleman Avenue in downtown San Jose, shown within the outline. Boundaries are approximate. The other project would build a 500-megawatt electricity transmission link and other facilities between and near PG&E’s existing Newark Substation in Fremont and the Northern Receiving Station in Santa Clara.“The Independent System Operator estimates that the proposed (Newark-Santa Clara) project will approximately cost $325 million to $510 million,” CAISO stated in an April 2022 report. “The project must be in-service no later than June 1, 2028.”

Electricity demand has grown rapidly in the South Bay and is expected to surge further, energy experts believe. CAISO also believes the projects will improve electricity reliability.The just-bought property in downtown San Jose would be used as the site of a new electricity complex.“Silicon Valley cannot achieve its Climate Smart policy goals of electrifying all buildings and electrifying all vehicles without this major upgrade to the electrical transmission system,” said Erik Schoennauer, a land-use consultant who is advising LS Power in its efforts to build facilities in the San Jose area.Here are key details for the two major projects in the Bay Area that LS Power’s affiliates intend to develop, according to documents on file with CAISO:
The Metcalf-San Jose Station B project will include two new high-voltage terminals that will connect to the existing substations. The new terminal centers will be connected by a 14-mile underground transmission line.
The Newark-Northern Gathering Station project will include two new high-voltage terminals that will connect to those existing stations. A 12-mile transmission line, partly overhead and partly underground, will connect the terminals.

As of April 2022, LS Power stated in a press release that it had raised $48 billion in debt and equity financing to bankroll its efforts in North America. In March 2023, LS Power stated it had raised $50 billion in debt and equity.The two Bay Area projects that LS Power has spearheaded are in the earliest stages of planning, development and obtaining permits, according to Schoennauer. Construction could begin sometime in 2026 with an eye to completion in 2028.“Using some of the most advanced smart grid technologies available, the project will create a robust new electrical connection in the South Bay to improve grid reliability and support the state’s climate goals,” said Carroll, the LS Power executive.
