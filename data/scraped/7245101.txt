Another year, another playoff series against the hated Boston Celtics. It sounds like a broken record, but the Philadelphia 76ers will play their archrival for the third time in six years during the Process Era. The annual tradition of a banged up Joel Embiid will also hang over the Sixers heads as the teams match up in the 2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Celtics come into the series as favorites after losing to the Golden State Warriors in last year's NBA Finals. An Embiid knee injury suffered during the Sixers' first-round sweep of the Brooklyn Nets also puts Philly at a disadvantage against a team they've struggled against all season. Will the Sixers make it back to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2001?

Since the NBA playoff bracket does not reseed, the Sixers will play the No. 2 seed Celtics even though the lower seeded New York Knicks and Miami Heat advanced in the first round. The Celtics topped the Atlanta Hawks 4-2, clinching a best-of-seven first-round matchup with a 128-120 win in Game 6. During the regular season, Boston went 3-1 against Philly. The Sixers lost the first three games against the Celtics, despite a 41-point effort from Embiid in February. Philly was able to salvage a win with a 103-101 victory in April thanks to 52 points from Embiid. The Sixers last playoff matchup against the Celtics came in 2020, when they were swept in the first round after being without an injured Ben Simmons. Embiid, Simmons and the Sixers also lost to the Celtics in the conference semifinals in 2018. The last time the Sixers defeated the Celtics in the playoffs was in 1981-1982, when they won in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the Los Angeles in the NBA Finals. Overall, the C's lead the Sixers 14-7 in their storied playoff history. 2023 NFL Draft tracker: Eagles' trade frenzy; live updates, round-by-round selections, analysis THE PICK IS IN: Philadelphia Eagles and 2023 NFL Draft: Here's everything you need to know After more than a week off waiting to see who they'll play, the Sixers can now prepare to play Boston. Since Trae Young and the Hawks were able to extend the first-round series to six games, the Sixers' schedule against the Celtics will look like this: Game 1: 76ers at Celtics on Monday, May 1, at 7:30 p.m. ET on TNT Game 2: 76ers at Celtics on Wednesday, May 3, at 8 p.m. ET on TNT Game 3: Celtics at 76ers on Friday, May 5, at 7:30 p.m. ET on ESPN Game 4: Celtics at 76ers on Sunday, May 7, at 3:30 p.m. ET on ESPN Game 5: 76ers at Celtics on Tuesday, May 9, at 7:30 p.m. ET on TNT Game 6: Celtics at 76ers on Thursday, May 11, at 7:30 p.m. ET on ESPN Game 7*: 76ers at Celtics on Saturday, May 14, time and channel TBD *If necessary  The biggest uncertainty surrounding the conference semifinals is whether Embiid will play after sustaining a right knee sprain in Game 3 against the Nets. After sitting out Game 1, Embiid's status for Game 2 on Wednesday in Boston is uncertain. During an appearance on TNT on Tuesday, Embiid said he was unsure as to whether he would he play. NBA Insider Shams Charania reported before Game 1 that Embiid underwent platelet-rich plasma treatment on the knee to help the injury heal quicker. From Run It Back on @FanDuelTV: The latest surrounding 76ers star Joel Embiid, who, sources say, underwent platelet-rich plasma treatment on his injured knee as part of his recovery process: pic.twitter.com/EWsEuETHn6 ‚Äî Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) May 1, 2023 When Embiid does return, he will likely play with a brace due to the LCL sprain, according to reports. History is repeating for Sixers fans and Embiid, with the star center injured again in the playoffs. Last season, he suffered a fractured orbital bone in the final minutes of a Game 6 clinching, first-round game against the Toronto Raptors while also playing with a thumb injury. The facial fracture forced Embiid to miss the first two games against the top-seeded Miami Heat in round two, torpedoing the team's chances of a long playoff run. Embiid gutted through much of the 2021 playoffs with a small lateral meniscus tear in his right knee before the team's heartbreaking, Game 7 Eastern Conference Seminal loss to the Hawks. Stomach issues plagued him during the 2019 conference semifinals against the Raptors, and another facial fracture limited him against the Celtics in 2018. Despite being without the big man, the Sixers pulled out a decisive 96-88 win in Game 4 in a first-round matchup against the Nets. With the sweep, the Sixers finished the year 8-0 against the Nets, whose season ended in turmoil after being forced to trade stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. The series wasn't without drama, as Game 3 featured Embiid receiving a flagrant foul for kicking Nets center Nic Claxton and Harden getting ejected after hitting the groin of Nets' Royce O'Neale. The victory clinched the Sixers' first playoff sweep since 1991 when Charles Barkley led the team to a first-round 3-0 series win over the Milwaukee Bucks. It's the team's first sweep in a best-of-seven series since they knocked out the Bucks in the conference semifinals in 1985, Barkley's rookie year. Here's a look at the series recap: Game 1: 76ers 121, Nets 101 Game 2: 76ers 96, Nets 84 Game 3: 76ers 102, Nets 97 Game 4: 76ers 96, Nets 88 Boston Celtics (2) vs. Philadelphia 76eres (3): Series tied 2-2 New York Knicks (5) vs. Miami Heat (8): Heat lead 3-1 Denver Nuggets (1) vs. Phoenix Suns (4): Series tied 2-2Golden State Warriors (6) vs. Los Angeles Lakers (7): Lakers lead 3-1 Milwaukee Bucks (1) vs. Miami Heat (8): Heat won 4-1 Boston Celtics (2) vs. Atlanta Hawks: Celtics won 4-2 Philadelphia 76ers (3) vs. Brooklyn Nets (6): 76ers won 4-0 Cleveland Cavaliers (4) vs. New York Knicks: Knicks won 4-1 Denver Nuggets (1) vs. Minnesota Timberwolves (8): Nuggets won 4-1 Memphis Grizzlies (2) vs. Los Angeles Lakers (7): Lakers won 4-1 Sacramento Kings (3) vs. Golden State Warriors (6): Warriors won 4-3 Phoenix Suns (4) vs. Los Angeles Clippers: Suns won 4-1 This article originally appeared on Delaware News Journal: Sixers-Celtics schedule: Game 5 moves to Boston after 76ers tie series Christian Polanco and Alexis Guerreros talk about all the action from the United States successful group stages in the 2024 Olympics, the club friendlies happening in the U.S. and an awkward substation with Korbin Albert.
