 Hey dear JavaScript Lovers!  We are super stoked to dive deep into 3 BRAND NEW topics that we will discuss at React Live Conference on 28-29 September 2023 in Amsterdam!   Thinking to attend? THE SUMMER SALE with tickets starting at only â‚¬249 will end in 10 workdays ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥   Discover the power of Remix, a groundbreaking full-stack framework that embraces web standards to redefine modern web development. As developers grapple with complex tools and frameworks, creating performant and maintainable applications becomes increasingly challenging.  Enter Remix InÂ Alexandra Spalato's talk fromÂ Storyblok and learn how Remix harnesses web standards, such as URLs, Fetch API, HTML, and HTTP caching, to elevate developer and user experiences, ultimately empowering you to become a better developer!  2. Why obtaining long-term feedback on feature adoption can be difficult to validate! Building beloved user applications is a challenging yet rewarding pursuit for us working in technology today. While real user monitoring, or RUM, metrics are added early for external-facing applications, it is often added as an afterthought in the building of applications when building applications for users within organisations.  Instead, we rely on anecdotal discussions and review feedback that, for many reasons, can leave us with an incomplete or accurate picture of the adoption of the software we build. Carly Richmond from Elastic will use her experience in building applications in investment banking to discuss the reasons why obtaining long-term feedback on feature adoption can be difficult to validate. Also outlining how monitoring applications using the Elastic RUM agent and React Framework extension combined with OpenTelemetry for Node.js can help you quantify user experience satisfaction and adoption to ensure we are providing effective experiences for users.  3. Detecting React bugs automatically with linting and TypeScript  Josh is an independent full-time open source developer.  He works on projects in the TypeScript ecosystem, most notably typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code.  Josh is also the author of the Oâ€™Reilly Learning TypeScript book, a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies, and an active conference speaker. His personal projects range from static analysis to meta-languages to recreating retro games in the browser.  More React Live Conference talk updates soon from the Creator of CodeSandbox, Ives van Hoorne and World Renowned React Speaker Kent C. Dodds.   Read more about React Live over here!
