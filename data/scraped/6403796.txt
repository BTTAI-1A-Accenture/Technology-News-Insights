HiveMQ Edge helps manufacturing organizations simplify and modernize their Industrial IoT infrastructure by converting proprietary OT protocols like Modbus and OPC UA into the standardized MQTT format at the edge for easy integration with enterprise and cloud systems. Manufacturers face several challenges when it comes to integrating industrial data from OT to IT, including diverse endpoints with legacy connectivity interfaces and point-to-point data integration patterns that limit scalability. »HiveMQ Edge« solves these challenges and supports the Unified Namespace architecture, allowing data to be mapped from various sources into a structured and centralized data hub that enables real-time data analysis. »We see a clear need for HiveMQ Edge in the market as manufacturers struggle to solve complex edge connectivity challenges on their path to digital transformation,« said Dominik Obermaier, Co-founder and CTO, HiveMQ. »We’re making it faster and easier to connect the edge and reap the full benefits of IIoT with an open gateway that converts proprietary and legacy protocols to MQTT. We added a built-in broker for efficient messaging so users can deploy rapidly, drive costs down, and scale up easily.« HiveMQ Edge helps companies modernize their IIoT infrastructure with these benefits: HiveMQ invites developers to download the OSS version of HiveMQ Edge on Github, connect it to devices at the edge, run workloads and provide feedback in the HiveMQ Community Forum.
