FedEx has fired an employee who went viral in a TikTok video for telling a Spanish-speaking creator to "go back" to her home country when they began arguing during a package delivery. In a statement to Insider, the company said the depicted behavior is "unacceptable" and "contrary to the professionalism" it expects of its workers. A viral video of the incident was shared earlier this week by Karla De La Torre or "Karleshion," a sketch comedy creator with nearly 10 million followers on TikTok. The clip started after an argument had seemingly already broken out between De La Torre and the FedEx worker whose name is unknown. It showed the visibly distraught employee carrying a large package from a FedEx truck out onto a front yard, and asking people behind the camera to help her move the boxes to them. When De La Torre responded in Spanish, the FedEx worker begins to mock her. The person is then heard yelling, "go back to your country" and "this is America." The video has racked up over 23 million views since it was posted on Tuesday.

                               On Wednesday, the now-former employee posted her own TikTok under the account @annessa222, apologizing for her racist remarks. "I ended up saying a racist comment and I'm deeply sorry," she said in a stitched video to the original. "I wanna deeply apologize to Karla and her family because I shouldn't have acted like that." The user claimed their argument broke out after De La Torre accused her of breaking her package. Insider has attempted to reach her at the account @annessa222. Dozens of comments to De La Torre's original video are calling for FedEx to step in. When reached on Thursday, a spokesperson for FedEx told Insider that it is longer employing the woman depicted in the TikTok, and denounced her actions.Â  "This behavior is unacceptable and contrary to the professionalism demonstrated by service providers in safely and reliably delivering millions of packages every day," a spokesperson for FedEx Ground said in an email statement. "FedEx Ground expects the highest levels of conduct from service providers, and we can confirm that this individual is no longer providing service." Insider has reached out to De La Torre for comment.
