						 THERE was joy an excitement by the banks of the River Deel when news broke that a Crossmolina shop had sold a €200,000 lotto ticket.  A local syndicate were celebrating in Lotto HQ after landing a €200,000 payout from a €10 All Cash Spectacular scratch card, which was purchased at Hiney’s Londis of Crossmolina.  The winners admitted that they chose hid their €200,000 scratch card in a sock drawer. "As soon as I saw the amount on the scratch card, I started to worry about where to hide it," a syndicate member stated. "I must have spent the last few days going around the house making sure all of the windows and doors were locked at all times. I couldn’t help worrying about what if it was stolen so I decided to put it somewhere where no one would look - I kept it hidden in a fluffy sock at the bottom of the sock drawer!”  “Even though the scratch card has brought so much joy and luck, we couldn’t wait to get up to Dublin to get rid of it. The celebration definitely feels much more real now sitting here in the Winners Room and seeing all these zeroes on our cheque. We always hoped we’d be popping into Lotto HQ someday and you never know, we could be back again!” they continued.  Nearly 30 cent in every €1 spent on all National Lottery games goes back to Good Causes in the areas of sport, youth, health, welfare, education, arts, heritage, and the Irish language. In total more than €6 billion has been raised for Good Causes since the National Lottery was established 35 years ago. In 2021 alone, €304 million was raised for local Good Causes in communities across Ireland.           4 To continue reading this article, please subscribe and support local journalism!
