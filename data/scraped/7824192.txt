                            At least six people were killed and two injured after a trailer truck carrying steel rebar hit seven vehicles in Boyolali, Central Java, on Friday.

                         t least six people were killed and two injured after a trailer truck carrying steel rebar hit seven vehicles after an alleged brake failure at Kilometer 487 on the Semarang-Solo toll road in Boyolali, Central Java, at around 4 a.m. on Friday. The truck was heading toward Surakarta when it hit seven vehicles parked on the side of the road, including a car carrier trailer, a tanker truck, a cargo trailer and a passenger van. “Four passengers of the van were killed. I have ordered the traffic authorities to clear up the area,” Central Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Ahmad Lutdi said. The Semarang-Solo toll road is part of the trans-Java toll road, which connects Jakarta all the way to East Java. The toll road is expected to see an increase in traffic as the end of Ramadan nears, and people travel to celebrate Idul Fitri in their hometowns as part of the annual mudik (exodus). Idul Fitri is expected to fall between April 21 and 22 this year. The 2023 mudik season is expected to see a record of more than 120 million Indonesians traveling across the country.
