The season is being supported by actor and presenter David Harewood, who presented the acclaimed documentary, Psychosis and Me and will be appearing in a short film for the BBC Headroom site and on social media. David says: âMental health problems are very common. When I was 23 I experienced a powerful and mind-bending psychotic episode which resulted in me being sectioned and hospitalised. It was a hugely traumatic experience, not just for me but also to friends and family who had to watch me go through it. "With the help and support of those around me I made a full recovery, but that isnât the same for everyone. Some people need lifelong support and understanding, and this is why Iâm supporting the BBCâs Mental Health season." On the BBC Headroom website youâll find a selection of expert tips, coping strategies and inspiring documentaries to help you get through the day. Not everything can be fixed quickly or simply, but knowing there are others who understand what youâre feeling, and knowing there is support out there, can help.â New content on the website includes digital animations and videos on a number of themes, from how to support friends and family struggling with their mental health to how therapy actually works. The site will also act as a hub for highlights from throughout the week, as well as provide access to some of the best mental health content from the BBCâs wide ranging collection across TV, radio and digital.

Charlotte Moore, BBC Chief Content Officer says : âThe BBC has a long commitment to tackling mental health issues in our programming and with many people still living through challenging times, itâs important that we continue to raise awareness and provide help and support. "This year we are marking Mental Health Awareness Week with a wide range of content across television, radio and digital including documentaries, specially curated playlists, discussion and expert tips and advice. I hope it will give people the tools they need to look after their own wellbeing as well as helping them to support those close to them.â Mind Chief Executive, Sarah Hughes, says: âOur own research shows us that dramas, documentaries and news reports prompt people to talk about their mental health, seek help and support other people in their lives. Itâs crucial the media helps raise awareness and provides accurate information about mental health. Thatâs why I am delighted the BBC is putting mental health centre stage across its channels during Mental Health Awareness Week. For too long, discussions around mental health were taboo and frowned upon. No more. But there is still so much to do. âThe BBCâs mental health season will make a real difference. Encouraging discussion, raising awareness and signposting where to find support cannot be underestimated.â Matt Willis: Fighting Addiction BBC One and iPlayer Musician, actor and dad of three, Matt Willis, may seem to have it all.

Anton Danyluk on Body Shame Anton Danyluk, the ripped reality star from Lanarkshire, has battled body insecurity all his life. As an overweight kid, he faced body-shaming and bullying. He reacted by hitting the gym to build muscle and confidence. But despite his toned body, heâs still anxious about his appearance â and heâs not alone. More than a quarter of teenage boys in Scotland stress about their body image and social media is making the problem worse. Now Anton wonders if heâs part of the issue as he peppers his socials with muscly selfies and gym shots. In this new 30 minute documentary he reflects on whether he is hiding his own insecurities and also inadvertently making boys believe in an unrealistic ideal body. He meets young men who struggle with their body image to understand how theyâre affected by what they see online and compare their experiences of body shaming with his own. In a frank, personal journey, he examines his time on reality TV and speaks to mental health experts as he questions how the media obsession with âripped physiquesâ affects Scotlandâs young men. Anton Danyluk on Body Shame, is a Firecrest Films production, and will go out on BBC Scotland and BBC iPlayer on May 18.

Northern Ireland has a mental health crisis. It has one of the highest suicide rates in the UK and the majority of suicides are men. Some areas, including where Carl grew up, have particularly high levels of suicide. In this hard-hitting documentary, Carl speaks to experts about the challenges facing young men in Northern Ireland and what support exists for those who do seek help. Carl opens up for the first time about the things that made him feel angry, isolated and ashamed and meets other young men who are breaking the silence on their own mental health story. Janet Devlin: Young, Female And Addicted Janet Devlin, from Co Tyrone in Northern Ireland, was just 16 years old when she competed in the eighth series of The X-Factor in 2011, where she finished in fifth place. After shooting to fame, loneliness and social anxiety led to a downward spiral that was fuelled by alcohol and resulted in addiction, self-harm and attempts to take her own life. In a 2022 documentary, broadcast last year by BBC Northern Ireland - and available again for Mental Health Awareness Week - the singer songwriter talks candidly about her alcoholism and mental health and speaks to medical experts about why young women are drinking more than ever. The programme hears from a consultant psychiatrist, who considers addiction to be a mental health issue in itself. Janet Devlin: Young, Female And Addicted, also follows Janet as she embarks on a journey to try to understand the root cause of her addiction and how it impacted those closest to her, including her mum and her manager, who speak publicly for the first time about the effect it had on them and their lives. Over the course of the documentary, she meets other young women from Northern Ireland who are recovering from alcoholism, or whose lives and families have been impacted by addiction. Their deeply personal stories reveal the intrinsic link between mental health and addiction and illustrate how easy it can be to fall into alcohol dependence. Janet Devlin: Young, Female And Addicted is available on BBC iPlayer.
