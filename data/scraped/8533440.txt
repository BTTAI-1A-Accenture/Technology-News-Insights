As the 2024 presidential election draws closer, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows President Joe Biden continues to hold an edge over potential Republican challengers Trump and Ron DeSantis. Among registered voters, Biden led Trump by six percentage points in a hypothetical match-up, 44% to 38%. However, the poll indicates that Biden’s lead may be shaky should the situation at the US southern border worsen. In a mid-March poll, Biden led Trump by five points after trailing him by three points in February. A separate survey data from Morning Consult showed Trump increased his lead among Republican voters polled.
