 Behind every successful company, there are individuals whose unwavering commitment and outstanding contributions form the bedrock of its triumphs.  Ever thought of a career in aviation? Our Heathrow VIP Baggage Driver,¬†Manav Mahendru provides us with a unique window into his aviation career and his pursuit for greatness within his role.  #aviationjobs¬†#wilsonjames¬†#heathrowairport¬†#hiringnow¬†#aviationcareers¬†#wj¬†#vip¬†#vipchauffeur What is your current role and how did you get there? I started my apprenticeship with WJ in 2019 through the Heathrow share apprentice scheme. Throughout my journey, I had the privilege of spending time with various departments of the company such as looking over the training program for new recruits on the PRM contract and assisting with the roll out of our mobile covid-19 testing sites. I spent my last few months at the VIP contract and enjoyed the hands-on working environment they have to offer. Upon finishing my apprenticeship, I was offered a part time contract as a baggage driver while also giving a hand in the office to support the day to day running of the operation. I was pleased with the conditions and happy to carry on at Heathrow. Why did you first join the aviation industry, and why did you carry on? My journey in the aviation industry started around the time Wilson James took over the PRM contract in T5 around late 2019. I was extremely fascinated by the idea of working in an airport environment. What I thought would be a ‚Äúdesk working job‚Äù quickly proved me wrong and I ended up supporting some of the biggest contracts in aviation whilst being on site. The reason why I carried on is because I really enjoyed spending my time during my apprenticeship and wanted to stay working in the airport. What do you think the public‚Äôs perception of the aviation industry is, and how does this compare to what you‚Äôve experienced? Throughout my time at the airport, I have had the opportunity to meet so many people and its always a different conversation. Whether its about the misconceptions of working at the airport or spending hours speaking to an aviation fanatic about different planes in service and the models that are equipped. Some people think its very hard to get a job at the airport and the fact that you must have a certain skill set. I previously also thought this was the case however, after spending so many years at the airport I was proved wrong. You in fact, do not need any qualifications to get started at the airport. If you can bring the best version of yourself there is something here for everybody. People from all walks of life are welcome, which is something I learned at Wilson James. What do you like about the aviation industry, and what has surprised you? As a child living locally, I was always greeted with planes flying over my house and always wondered where they were headed to. As I got older, I kept researching and learning more about the airport and as soon as I was able to get an apprenticeship ‚Äì the airport was my first option for looking. I guess I like the environment the aviation industry provides to progress as well as having a chance to work on your own progress at your own pace.  What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?  When I first started working at Heathrow, I faced many challenges but most of them were small issues that could be solved with a bit of lifestyle change which I managed to do. My biggest challenge is probably maintaining a work-education balance while doing my apprenticeship but the management at Wilson James were very understanding and I frequently had meetings with my manager to ensure I was on track and up to date with my work. What is a day in your working life like? A day in my life would probably consist of grabbing a coffee in the morning and then going to the office to find out the low down for the day. We are usually briefed at the start of the day and you‚Äôd see how many jobs you will get. Once the dispatchers assign me and a porter to a job, we then leave with the van and meet the Liaison Officers at the stand who then give us baggage tags to collect the baggage. We then proceed to collect the bags and then deliver them back to the Windsor suite for scanning. Additionally, in the down time I help the management upstairs in the office with the background running of the operation. The management at Heathrow VIP has been very generous to allow me to learn some great things to progress my career even further. What advice would you give to anyone thinking about joining the aviation industry today? The aviation industry is constantly developing and readily improving. The opportunities in the aviation industry are immense and there is always that first step waiting to be taken, so go for it! Who do you think would suit or enjoy working in aviation? I think for anyone working in aviation, you would have to enjoy the environment and the excitement to be around aircrafts as well as being enthusiastic about providing the right customer service. Moreover, you need to be passionate about working in a fast paced evolving environment which is exactly what‚Äôs offered here. Since I have been working in aviation no two days have been the same for myself so therefore, an adaptable personality is also very essential, and keeps be motivated.
