Sarina Bolden’s historic goal midway through the first half was enough to secure a seismic upset, with Jacqui Hand’s equaliser disallowed for offside as New Zealand failed to back up their opening victory over Norway. The result blew Group A wide open and all four teams are still able to advance after Norway were held to a goalless draw by Switzerland in the day’s late kick-off. Earlier on Tuesday, Catalina Usme and 18-year-old star Linda Caicedo scored to give Colombia a 2-0 victory over South Korea in their opening game in Group H. Tomorrow, the Republic of Ireland will fight to keep their World Cup hopes alive as they face Olympic champions Canada in a pivotal Group B clash. Ireland are already on the brink of elimination following their opening defeat to co-hosts Australia and their fate could be sealed if they lose to Canada and results elsewhere don’t go their way.

New Zealand 0-1 Philippines - Sarina Bolden goal stuns co-hosts Colombia defeat South Korea 2-0 in Group H with Linda Caicedo on target 14:34 , Jamie Braidwood Norway star Caroline Graham Hansen said she has been shown no “respect” as she questioned head coach Hege Riise’s decision to start her on the bench in the 0-0 draw with Switzerland. “It’s tough, I don’t know what I can say. There’s not much I can say, I feel like I’m standing here with my hands tied,” Graham Hansen, who was brought on after the 55th minutes, said in a post-game TV interview. “I feel I have been stepped on for a whole year - everyone says all the time that we have to stand together as a team and as a nation, but I feel I’ve been on the receiving end (of a raw deal). “Nothing comes for free in life, but I thought I had earned a certain amount of respect, but maybe that wasn’t the case.” When asked about the decision to bench Graham Hansen, coach Riise said she had no regrets. “Caroline is entitled to be frustrated and to express an opinion, but since I arrived in this position I have always said the team is the most important thing,” Riise said. “All players want to start matches. I reached the decision in the best interest of my team and I defend my decision today.” 🗣️ Graham Hansen: “I really feel that I have been trampled upon for a whole year. We still have a chance to qualify but I,m still disappointed. I thought I had earned respect over the year but that wasn't the case.”— @NRKno pic.twitter.com/Bedkq5LgaP — Barça Femení (@BarcaFem) July 25, 2023 14:31 , Jamie Braidwood Ireland face Canada tomorrow with their Women’s World Cup hopes on the line following their losing start against co-hosts Australia. “Winning starts with not losing,” head coach Vera Pauw said. “If you play a game like this against an Olympic champion, I have to stay realistic but it’s clear that if we want to go through in this group, we need a result. “If we win, we have it in our own hands. If we have a draw then we depend on other results. “Canada is a very, very experienced team and they know how to have patience in getting their results. They often get their results in the later stages so that shows they have the trust to keep on going.” Pauw is “a bit concerned” about Louise Quinn but revealed “plan B is ready” should the defender unexpectedly fail her fitness test following a foot injury. 14:21 , Jamie Braidwood The Lionesses trained in front of over 2,500 fans at Central Coast Stadium this morning as the team set up base in the coastal town on Terrigal in New South Wales, where they will remain for the remainder of their World Cup adventure. “We are delighted to be on the Central Coast and we want to thank everyone who has made us feel so welcome,” Sarina Wiegman said. “It is such a beautiful part of Australia and it really feels like a ‘home from home’ both in our base camp hotel but also at the Central Coast Stadium. A huge amount of work has gone in behind the scenes and we are very grateful. “To have around 2,500 fans and so many of them children watch training is so amazing and we never take the support for granted.” 13:41 , Jamie Braidwood England forward Lauren Hemp on how the Lionesses can rediscover their scoring touch: “I think we are all working really hard in training to make sure we are being more clinical, creating more chances and obviously getting our goal percentage higher. “But we know it is something we need to improve on and we are working really hard as a team to make sure we are ready for the next game. We will be raring and ready to score some goals. “We have seen in games that we are capable of doing that, so it’s not like we have not scored before. We are all capable of scoring. It is just about making it click and getting those connections working. “I think obviously being at a World Cup is new for a lot of us – a lot of us have never been to one before. It’s across the other side of the world and I’m not making excuses but it’s important that each game we build on and we’ve seen that last summer, so we’re more than capable of doing that.” 12:59 , Jamie Braidwood Norway star Ada Hegerberg explains the injury that ruled her out of this morning’s 0-0 draw with Switzerland: “I felt discomfort when sprinting right after the anthems. We decided with the staff that no risk should be taken and no subs should be wasted in such an important game for us, and we all trusted Sophie, Karina, and the team to do the job, which they did. We move on.” I felt discomfort when sprinting right after the anthems. We decided with the staff that no risk should be taken and no subs should be wasted in such an important game for us, and we all trusted Sophie, Karina, and the team to do the job, which they did. We move on. 🇳🇴 pic.twitter.com/nMeC5psw0p — Ada S Hegerberg (@AdaStolsmo) July 25, 2023 12:32 , Jamie Braidwood England defender Lucy Bronze is drawing on the experience of her first World Cup eight years ago to allay fears that the Lionesses did not play like favourites in their 1-0 opening victory against Haiti in Brisbane. That win, sealed by Georgia Stanway’s twice-taken penalty against a side 49 places below England in the FIFA rankings, extended the Lionesses’ streak without a goal from open play to three games, including their 0-0 behind-closed-doors pre-tournament training match with Canada. Bronze made her World Cup debut at the 2015 tournament, where England fell to France in their opener but ultimately finished up with the third-place medal for their best-ever finish in a global showpiece. She said: “Well, in my first World Cup we lost the first game and ended finishing third. There’s only so much you can take from the game. The most important thing is it gives us momentum but it’s better than having to chase points and we get to focus on the next two games. “We’re playing against players we’ve never played before. It takes a little while to get into those games. Once we got going you saw England coming back to life again. We need to do that more for longer.” 12:11 , Jamie Braidwood Casey Phair, at 16 years and 26 days, made history when she came off the bench for South Korea today, becoming the youngest player in World Cup history - women’s or men’s. “Going on, I was really, really nervous,” said Phair, who has an American father and a South Korean mother and was raised in the United States. “It was a scary moment, but then going on and running around, I think it just settled in.” The record previously was held by the late Ifeanyi Chiejine, who was 16 years and 34 days old when she played for Nigeria in the 1999 Women’s World Cup. 11:48 , Jamie Braidwood After numerous games at the Women's World Cup have been halted for video assistant referee (VAR) review, South Korea coach Colin Bell angrily wondered why there was no VAR for a penalty called against his team in a 2-0 loss to Colombia on Tuesday. Catalina Usme scored on a 30th-minute penalty kick after Shim Seo-yeon was whistled for a handball, deflating the Korean side. "The penalty was a little bit harsh because the ball was really well-struck, at speed, at distance, I don't know where Seo-yeon would have had to put our arms," said Bell, on the shot that glanced off the defender's arm. "I just wondered why that was not reviewed. I've watched all the matches so far in this tournament, you've had five minutes with review at times (when) nobody knows what's going on. This time it's a clear penalty. So, then you go down (a goal), and then it's very difficult against a very strong Colombia team." Reuters 11:29 , Jamie Braidwood The closest Norway came thanks to this injection of pace from Caroline Graham Hansen, but they needed much, much more. Gaelle Thalmann is keeping #SUI in this game, remarkable performance 🙌#FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/vBzJ1RZgzE — ITV Football (@itvfootball) July 25, 2023 11:16 , Jamie Braidwood A head-scratcher for Caroline Graham Hansen after starting on the bench today, but all smiles for Arsenal team-mates Lia Walti and Frida Maanum. 11:06 , Jamie Braidwood So - all to play for on the final day, but Norway will need to win against the Philippines if they are to advance. You would imagine that they should get that victory, but Philippines have shown that they should not be dismissed following their victory against New Zealand. Norway would also need to win by two goals if the match between Switzerland and New Zealand finishes as a draw. If there is a winner in that match they will top the group. Switzerland - 4 (+2) New Zealand - 3 (0) Philippines - 3 (-1) Norway - 1 (-1) 10:55 , Jamie Braidwood You have to say that’s another hugely disappointing result and performance from Norway. They may have been unlucky to lose Ada Hegerberg to injury moments before kick-off, but Hege Riise’s side needed a response and they didn’t provide one. They get their first point of the World Cup but a side with so much attacking potential remains without a goal at this World Cup. Norway are also on their worst run of form in 10 days, and have not won in six games. It’s a decent point for Switzerland, who were in a better position having won their opening match. And with victory for the Philippines earlier against New ealand, it means that it’s all to play for on the final day with all four teams still able to advance. 10:52 , Jamie Braidwood The points are shared and it will be all to play for on the final day! 10:51 , Jamie Braidwood 90+2 mins: A late flurry from Switzerland as CrnogorÄeviÄ goes on a run down the left and swings a cross to the subsitute Meriame Terchoun. She’s unable to get a connection on the header and Norway clear! 10:48 , Jamie Braidwood 89 mins: Will we see one last chance? Switzerland have control and are trying to see this out. There will be four minutes of time added on. 10:44 , Jamie Braidwood 86 mins: Chance for Norway as they win a free kick on the edge of the box... Graham Hansen stands over it... Over the bar! 10:42 , Jamie Braidwood 82 mins: Space is starting to open up for Switzerland on the counter-attack - Piubel had a great opportunity to play a square ball across goal following a touch from Sow, but she overhit the cross. Bachmann was lingering at the back post. 10:37 , Jamie Braidwood 78 mins: As Norway continue to push for the breakthrough, Switzerland are happy to soak up the pressure. That’s the advantage winning the opening game of the group gives you. Vilde Boe Risa lifts a harmless shot over the crossbar following a corner. 10:34 , Jamie Braidwood 74 mins: SAVE! Graham Hansen works space on the edge of the box as she shifts the ball past a couple of defenders - she then takes aim with a curling effort towards the near post. Thalmann gets across and saves, and then does brilliantly to get up and deny Maanum on the follow up. 10:31 , Jamie Braidwood 70 mins: Now this would have been a goal. The ball sits up for Geraldine Reuteler after taking a smart touch on the left edge of the box. The midfielder attempts the volley and catches it well, but it’s once again straight at the goalkeeper. 10:26 , Jamie Braidwood 66 mins: All of a sudden it’s end to end! Switzerland came forward on the counter-attack after stopping Graham Hansen. Crnogorcevic dribbled down the right but couldn’t find the pull-back to Sow. It does eventually drop to Sow in the box, but Maanum races back to make the challenge. 10:23 , Jamie Braidwood 64 mins: Bachmann has been Switzerland’s bright spark again today. The forward drops a shoulder and beats a couple of players on the edge of the box, but then drags her shot wide on her left foot. She didn’t get the connection there. 10:21 , Jamie Braidwood 61 mins: SAVE! That’s what Norway have been missing. Graham Hansen shapes onto her right foot from the edge of the box and whips in a dangerous cross that Switzerland just about manage to hack away. 10:16 , Jamie Braidwood 56 mins: Now, here comes Caroline Graham Hansen. The Barcelona star is off the bench and back on the right wing. Can she be the difference? 10:14 , Jamie Braidwood 53 mins: SAVE! More signs of life from Norway. Reiten clips a lovely ball into the box, looking for Roman Haug. It drops to Haavi, who hits a first-time shot that has to be palmed wide by Thalmann. 10:10 , Jamie Braidwood 48 mins: CHANCE! That could have been it for Norway! Mjelde meets the corner from the left and directs her header down into the ground - thankfully for Thalmann is bounces straight up at her. Either side of the Switzerland goalkeeper and that would have been the opener. 10:07 , Jamie Braidwood 46 mins: A livelier start from Norway, at least. A cross towards Roman Haug breaks to Maanum, who takes a touch, looks to turn, but sees her shot blocked from close range by a couple of Switzerland defenders. Hegerberg is back on the bench now for Norway, wrapped up in several layers. 10:03 , Jamie Braidwood Back underway! No changes, and no Graham Hansen, yet. 09:58 , Jamie Braidwood The BBC has apologised after one of its reporters asked the Morocco captain whether any of the squad at the ongoing Women’s World Cup are lesbians. Morocco, a Muslim-majority country, are the first Arab nation to qualify for the World Cup and critics claim the question posed to Ghizlane Chebbak in a pre-match press conference potentially endangered the safety of the squad. Same-sex sexual activity between men or women is criminalised in the North African country, with a maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment and a fine. BBC apologises for asking Morocco captain how many of the team are lesbians 09:50 , Jamie Braidwood And that is that. Norway had the best chance of the half through Sophie Román Haug, but her back-post header was straight at Gaëlle Thalmann. Norway still have not managed to recover from losing Hegerberg before kick off. 09:47 , Jamie Braidwood 44 mins: Bachmann hasn’t been able to make the same sort of impact that she managed against the Philippines. The forward is directed away from goal after attempting to dribble from the left channel. 09:44 , Jamie Braidwood 38 mins: Well, this has not been a classic. Switzerland are quite a slow and cautious team at the best of times, while Norway continue to frustrate and are offering very little again in terms of attacking play. The game needs a goal. 09:40 , Jamie Braidwood 34 mins: Off the bar! An awkward moment for Aurora Mikalsen in the Switzerland goal as Nadine Riesen drifts and moves in the rain. The goalkeeper has to tip it over as it catches the woodwork. 09:33 , Jamie Braidwood 31 mins: Chance! Switzerland wake up as Coumba Sow slips a pass through to Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic - the forward fires at goal from the angle but lifts the effort over the bar. It needed to be a perfect strike from there. 09:32 , Jamie Braidwood 28 mins: Emilie Haavi, another new addition to the Norway front three, picks out Roman Haug from the left but the striker is unable to direct her header on target this time. 09:27 , Jamie Braidwood 24 mins: SAVE! Better from Norway and they go close to taking the lead! Román Haug is picked out at the back post, but her header back across goal is saved by Gaëlle Thalmann and Switzerland hack clear. Norway are taking charge now after Switzerland’s decent start. 09:24 , Jamie Braidwood 20 mins: I do not really understand what Norway are trying to do here. Guro Reiten is being asked to mark Lia Walti out of the game, which seems a complete waste of such an excellent attacking player, especially when Norway now need extra attacking options with Hegerberg and Graham Hansen out. Maren Mjelde fires Norway’s first shot over from the corner. 09:19 , Jamie Braidwood 15 mins: Ah, that was a chance for Switzerland! Ana-Maria Crnogorcevic had the run of Bachmann to her left as Switzerland broke forward, but she instead looked for Seraina Séverin Piubel on the right. The pass is cut out and the move breaks down. 09:14 , Jamie Braidwood 12 mins: ITV are now reporting that Hegerberg suffered an injury during the last action of her warm-up. That is cruel. 09:11 , Jamie Braidwood 8 mins: Switzerland have started well here, as they look to make the most of the opportunity that has been presented to them. Ramona Bachmann is likely to carry their threat and the PSG forward is close to the opener as the ball breaks inside the Norway box - Thea Bjelde has to make an important block. 09:07 , Jamie Braidwood 4 mins: So with Caroline Graham Hansen already on the bench, Norway are now without another of their star forwards in Ada Hegerberg. There are reports that both players have been unwell this week, but that is such a huge blow ahead of what is really a must-win clash. 09:04 , Jamie Braidwood 1 min: Underway in Hamilton! And there’s a stunning bit of news right from the start! Ada Hegerberg is off the pitch, heading down the tunnel just seconds before kick off! The striker has been replaced in the line-up by Sophie Román Haug. What on earth has happened there?! 08:59 , Jamie Braidwood It looks an awful evening in Hamilton, with the pitch under a cloud of misty rain. Lots of star WSL quality on display here, it should be a great clash - and the earlier result between New Zealand and the Philippines in Group A really ups the stakes too. That said, nothing will be decided today in terms of qualification. 08:46 , Jamie Braidwood This morning’s upset between New Zealand and Philippines has offered a lifeline to Norway, who lost their opening match to the co-hosts in Group A. They will have to improve when they take on Switzerland, who were 2-0 winners against the Philippines, after their display against New Zealand was slammed back home. The big team news is that Caroline Graham Hansen drops to the bench in one of three changes named by Hege Riise, as Norway try to find the right combination. Will we see more more Ada Hegerberg today? Switzerland: Thalmann, Aigbogun, Riesen, Stierli, Maritz, Sow, Reuteler, Waelti, Piubel, Bachmann, Crnogorcevic Norway: Mikalsen, Bjelde, Mjelde, Harviken, Tuva Hansen, Maanum, Risa, Reiten, Eikeland, Haavi, Hegerberg 08:34 , Jamie Braidwood Olivia McDaniel is the hero for the Philippines after that brilliant save against Grace Jale in stoppage time. 08:27 , Jamie Braidwood A HISTORIC WIN FOR THE PHILIPPINES! They stun the co-hosts New Zealand with their first ever win at the World Cup! In doing so, they become the first debutant country to win a match at this World Cup and the result blows Group A wide open. New Zealand had the chance to move to the verge of qualification after their opening win against Norway, but they must now go down to the final day. It means Norway have the chance to bounce back when they take on Switzerland next.

Brilliant from McDaniel! Bott swings in a cross to the back post and picks out Grace Jale, who looks to steer a volley back across goal. But the goalkeeper springs to her left and produces a massive stop with just minutes to go! McDaniel then clears the corner... can’t be much time left now. 08:23 , Jamie Braidwood 90 mins: Wilkinson meets the corner from the right and beats McDaniel to the cross but can’t steer the header on target! There will be five minutes added on. 08:19 , Jamie Braidwood 85 mins: The Philippines have been able to run the clock down at times and have controlled this second half well - although New Zealand should expect to have plenty of stoppage time at the end of the 90. 08:11 , Jamie Braidwood 78 mins: New Zealand have not managed a shot on target since the first half. This would be such a damaging result for the co-hosts, amid such a historic moment for the Philippines. 08:03 , Jamie Braidwood Or not! The goal has been disallowed for offside! Wilkinson went a touch too early and is offside by her shoulder! Let off for the Philippines and now New Zealand have to go again. #NZL thought they had their equaliser through Jacqui Hand 👀📺 VAR says otherwise... to the relief of #PHI#FIFAWWC pic.twitter.com/RfIhrrA0Mx — ITV Football (@itvfootball) July 25, 2023 08:00 , Jamie Braidwood Equaliser! Denied by the posts moments before, Hand finds the back of the net with the header! Wilkinson keeps the ball in play and swings a cross to the back post, where Hand steers it into the far corner! 07:57 , Jamie Braidwood 64 mins: OFF THE POST! New Zealand are getting closer! Chance, the best player on the pitch since coming on at half time, plays a brilliant pass across to Jacqui Hand, who strikes at goal first-time. It beats McDaniel, but strikes the bottom of the post and crashes out! 07:51 , Jamie Braidwood 57 mins: CHANCE! It should be 1-1! CJ Bott whips in an excellent cross from the left and Hannah Wilkinson makes a storming run to meet it on the six-yard line. The striker rises brilliantly, beating goalkeeper Olivia Davies-McDaniel to the cross, but she can’t keep the header down! It skims the roof of the net! 07:48 , Jamie Braidwood 53 mins: Chance has already made a difference for New Zealand, bringing much more threat and directness on the wings. But the Philippines have an excellent shape, and are making it really difficult for New Zealand to find any way through. 07:41 , Jamie Braidwood Back underway in Wellington! A huge 45 minutes coming up for New Zealand, who need to stay calm here as they attempt to come from behind against the Philippines. The hosts have made two changes at the break, with Celtic’s Olivia Chance and Annalie Longo both on. 07:37 , Jamie Braidwood A great result for Colombia this morning - and a brilliant Women’s World Cup debut for their 18-year-old star Linda Caicedo. The Real Madrid midfielder has now scored at the U17s World Cup, U20s World Cup and senior World Cup in just over a year.

A huge story is developing here as Philippines take a 1-0 lead into the break against the co-hosts New Zealand, thanks to Sarina Bolden’s historic goal. The Philippines have been organised, lively and adventurous, while New Zealand have been well off the levels required, with Hannah Wilkinson booked amid rising frustrations near the end of the half. 07:14 , Jamie Braidwood Catalina Usme and Linda Caicedo scored to give Colombia a 2-0 victory over South Korea in their opening game of the Women’s World Cup on Tuesday. Usme scored on a penalty kick in the 30th minute after a South Korean handball, sending keeper Yoon Younggeul the wrong way before slotting the ball into the far corner. Caicedo, an 18-year-old forward for Real Madrid, doubled Colombia’s lead nine minutes later, launching a high shot that Yoon got her hands on, but without the power to send it over the bar. The ball squirted into the net, to the delight of the yellow-clad Colombian fans at Sydney Football Stadium. “Well, I am extremely happy, but this has to do with the collective work of everyone,” Caicedo said on her first World Cup goal. “The feeling the group had going onto the pitch we were a bit anxious, we wanted the World Cup to start, and we wanted to start off on the right foot, this was something crucial. “Very happy for the goal and the victory.” Korea’s American-born teenager Casey Phair became the youngest player to take the field in Women’s World Cup history, subbing on in the 78th minute, just 26 days after her 16th birthday.
