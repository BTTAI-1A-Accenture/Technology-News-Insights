Harnessing advanced technology to enhance operations, ComEd  announced that, for the first time, its certified pilots will operate drones  remotely from any location across northern Illinois. Using new Skydio Drone  Dock technology, ComEd crews will test remote drone monitoring solutions that  will enable safe, cost-effective on-site and on-demand surveillance  capabilities without dispatching trucks of crews to perform in-person  inspections. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which regulates  commercial drone operation, permits organizations like ComEd to request  operational waivers that allow pilots to remotely operate drones without a  visual line of sight. These operational waivers will allow FAA-certified ComEd  pilots to use enhanced drones to support routine equipment inspection, enabling  utility crews to focus on priority grid repair and improvements. Remote monitoring by drone will support overall grid  performance by increasing ComEd’s ability to rapidly inspect equipment  throughout the electric company’s service territory. This will help reduce  operations and maintenance costs, while helping identify potential problem  areas and prevent power outages before they occur. Remote, off-site flying  capabilities will also maximize ComEd’s drone pilots’ efforts by limiting the  time they are physically needed in the field. To support ComEd’s nation-leading resiliency, routine  monitoring of equipment is crucial to ensuring all grid assets are operating as  intended. ComEd uses drones in a variety of ways, including to inspect power  lines and following storms to assess damage and enable crews to more quickly  and efficiently restore power. Drone pilots regularly join frontline workers in  the field to assist with line and equipment inspection. In 2022, ComEd also  began using drones to support vegetation management. The drones included in ComEd’s Drone Dock program will be  equipped with a high-resolution camera and thermography tools. These features  will allow the drones to capture extensive data, digital images and video from  all angles of grid equipment, which will then be reviewed to help preemptively  address future equipment failure based on equipment conditions and  environmental factors. The docking station, manufactured by Skydio, provides a  remote housing unit and launch pad for the drones when not in use. Currently,  the technology is installed at ComEd’s Chicago Training Center while ComEd  pilots are trained to use the new technology; the installation of additional  docks is expected later in 2023 at secure locations throughout ComEd’s service  territory.
