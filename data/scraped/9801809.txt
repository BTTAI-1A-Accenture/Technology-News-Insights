Co-founder and Head of Product & Marketing, UClean                         The retail industry in India is one of the fastest-growing sectors and a significant contributor to the country’s economy. India’s retail sector is expected to increase at a 9% rate between 2019 and 2030, from US$ 779 billion in 2019 to US$ 1,407 billion by 2026, and more than US$ 1.8 trillion by 2030, according to Kearney Research. However, like most industries, it is not free of gender bias. Gender bias can be defined as the preconceived notion that an individual’s gender determines their abilities, preferences, and limitations. Gender bias can lead to unequal opportunities, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace, resulting in a hostile work environment for women. The International Labor Organization (ILO) indicated that as of 2023, India’s gender pay gap was 27%. Thus, women in India earn, on average, 73% of what men do for the same profession. Furthermore, 4 out of 5 retail enterprises employ fewer than 10% women, according to the WEF’s “Future of Work in India” survey of 770 companies. Gender bias can lead to unequal opportunities, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace, resulting in a hostile work environment for women. According to a study by McKinsey & Company, companies with a diverse workforce are more likely to outperform their competitors financially. This is because a diverse workforce brings a variety of perspectives and ideas to the table, leading to better decision-making and more innovative solutions. Let’s look at some strategies that can help overcome gender bias in the retail industry. Address unconscious bias in the recruitment process Unconscious bias refers to the subconscious attitudes and stereotypes that affect our decision-making processes. It is a significant barrier to women’s advancement in the retail industry. Retail companies must take steps to eliminate unconscious bias in the recruitment process. For example, job descriptions should use gender-neutral language and avoid gender stereotypes. Retailers should also consider using blind resume screening, which removes identifying information such as the candidate’s name, gender, and age from the resume to prevent unconscious bias in the selection process. Provide equal opportunities for training and development To succeed in the retail industry, workers must continually update their skills and knowledge. However, women are often given fewer opportunities for training and development than their male counterparts. Retailers must provide equal opportunities for training and development to all employees regardless of gender. This will not only help to address gender bias but also improve the overall skills and competencies of the workforce. Offer flexible work arrangements Women in India face significant barriers to employment due to their family responsibilities. Many women are responsible for caring for children, elderly parents, or other family members, making it difficult for them to work regular hours. Retailers must offer flexible work arrangements, such as part-time work, job sharing, or work-from-home options, to enable women to balance their work and family responsibilities. This will not only help to attract and retain women in the workforce but also improve their job satisfaction and overall well-being. Encourage women’s leadership The lack of women in leadership positions is a significant barrier to gender equality in the retail industry. Retailers must actively encourage women’s leadership by providing opportunities for them to take on leadership roles and offering mentorship programs. Retailers can also create a supportive culture that values diversity and inclusion and promotes women’s leadership. Address gender pay gap The gender pay gap is a pervasive problem in the retail industry. Women in India earn only 62% of what men earn, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. Retailers must address the gender pay gap by conducting regular pay equity audits and adjusting salaries to ensure equal pay for equal work. Retailers must also provide transparency around pay and benefits to ensure that women are not being discriminated against. Create a safe and inclusive work environment Women in the retail industry often face sexual harassment, discrimination, and other forms of workplace violence. Retailers must create a safe and inclusive work environment where women can feel comfortable and confident. This includes implementing policies and procedures to prevent and respond to workplace violence, providing training to employees on how to recognize and prevent harassment and discrimination, and ensuring that women have access to support services if needed. Set targets and track progress To make progress towards gender equality in the retail industry, retailers must set targets and track their progress. This includes setting targets for the recruitment, retention, and promotion of women, as well as monitoring progress towards closing the gender pay gap. Leave policies To overcome gender bias in the retail industry, retail companies can implement comprehensive leave policies that support women’s health and well-being. Paid period leaves can help to reduce the stigma surrounding menstruation and enable women to take time off during their menstrual cycle without fear of negative consequences. In addition, maternity and parental leave can help to reduce the burden of child care responsibilities and enable women to return to work with greater ease. Providing flexible return-to-work options, such as part-time or job sharing, can also support women as they transition back to the workplace. Companies can also provide additional leave options for women who experience health issues related to pregnancy or childbirth, such as postpartum depression. Caregiver leave can benefit both men and women and allows employees to take time off to care for a sick family member or a newborn child. By implementing these leave policies, retail companies can show their commitment to supporting their employees and creating a more equitable and supportive workplace for all employees. Gender inclusive products  Another important strategy for overcoming gender bias in the retail industry is to offer gender-inclusive products. Traditional gender norms often dictate which products are marketed towards men and women, which can create a divide in the types of products available to consumers. By offering gender-inclusive products, retail companies can show their commitment to inclusivity and create a more welcoming and diverse shopping experience for all customers. This can include clothing lines that are designed to fit and flatter all body types, regardless of gender, or gender-neutral personal care products such as skincare or grooming items that are marketed towards all genders. By offering gender-inclusive products, retail companies can help to break down harmful stereotypes and create a more inclusive shopping experience for all customers, regardless of gender. Working conditions  Improving working conditions is an important strategy for overcoming gender bias in the retail industry. Women in particular can face pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, such as wearing heels or makeup, which can be uncomfortable or even harmful in the long term. Retail companies can address this bias by providing comfortable and practical uniform options that do not discriminate based on gender. This can include offering footwear options that do not require heels or providing makeup-free uniform policies. Retail companies can also ensure that all employees, regardless of gender, have access to safe and comfortable working conditions, including appropriate breaks, seating, and temperature control. By prioritizing the health and well-being of their employees, retail companies can create a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture that benefits all employees. Breaking bias Breaking bias is a crucial strategy for overcoming gender bias in the retail industry. Bias can manifest in many ways, including in hiring, promotion, and customer service interactions. By providing training and education to employees on unconscious bias, retail companies can help to create a more equitable and inclusive workplace culture. This can include workshops or training sessions on topics such as diversity and inclusion, cultural competency, and gender sensitivity. Retail companies can also implement policies and procedures that ensure fair and equitable treatment for all employees, regardless of gender. By breaking bias and promoting inclusivity, retail companies can create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all employees and customers alike. Conclusion Gender bias in the retail industry is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to overcome. By conducting a gender pay equity analysis, creating a diverse and inclusive workforce, establishing a clear path for advancement, and implementing flexible work arrangements, businesses can take steps towards reducing gender bias and creating a more equitable workplace.      Views expressed above are the author's own.
