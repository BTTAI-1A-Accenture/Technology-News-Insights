         York-based fabricator Camfab has added to the welter of front box options with a new version designed to hook directly to the tractor’s tombstone. The Smartbox weighs 400kg as standard, but there is plenty of scope for bulking it up, primarily by slotting a 600kg, 800kg or 1,000kg concrete block into the central void using the integrated pallet tine sleeves.

However, those who require that space for carrying a 200-litre diesel tank (£590) can opt to bolt 200kg, 20mm-thick belly plates underneath to add the necessary ballast. Standard features include twin-lock, shelved storage cupboards on either side and a full complement of work, road and side lights. There is also a raft of extras, such as a demountable 4in vice that mounts on top, stainless steel name plates for the front (£190) and a twin camera kit with 5in in-cab monitor (£495).
