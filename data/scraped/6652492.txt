Since its establishment in 2020, Pinnacle Targeted Marketing has swiftly ascended to become one of the UK's leading digital marketing agencies specialising in investor lead generation. Leveraging expertise in PPC (Pay Per Click) marketing, social media, and display advertising, the firm has achieved unparalleled growth in a notably short timeframe. The team behind Pinnacle's remarkable success story boasts over a decade of experience in the financial services sector. This depth of knowledge about various products and markets has solidified the company’s foothold in the competitive digital landscape. Their prowess extends internationally, with lead generation in territories such as the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UAE. "We are proud of the diversity in our advertising portfolio," says Sarah Green - Head of Customer Relations, "Whether it’s Property/Real Estate Investments, Fixed Term Investments like corporate Bonds, or Physical products, our team is adept at promoting a wide range of investment products." But what truly distinguishes Pinnacle Targeted Marketing from its peers? An impressive ROAS (return on ad spend). Their exceptional capacity to provide clients with a high return on their investments has propelled Pinnacle’s rapid expansion. Moreover, their organic growth strategy, reliant entirely on word of mouth, is a testament to their top-tier services and client satisfaction. For a firm experiencing such exponential growth, their zero-marketing approach and reliance on client referrals are nothing short of exceptional. As Pinnacle charts the next phase of its growth story, they are poised to broaden their client base, welcoming external clients into their fold. This move underscores the firm's readiness to amplify its reach and further solidify its position in the digital marketing arena.
