Fourteen California counties are eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government following recent storms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Wednesday the deadline is fastly approaching for residents of designated counties to register with FEMA for disaster assistance.  “FEMA disaster assistance cannot return you to your pre-disaster situation. It is meant to help you into a safe, secure and sanitary situation,” FEMA officials said in a statement. “If your home is damaged, you may either receive funds to aid with its repair or, if it’s unlivable, an offer of temporary housing.”  Officials added that the Individual Assistance Program also could provide funds to eligible survivors to replace clothing, furniture, or other contents of their homes. People can also apply for a disaster loan from the Small Business Administration, though officials say not everyone will be eligible.  The registration deadline is Thursday, Mar. 16. Representative Jimmy Panetta and 25 members of the California Congressional Delegation formally announced the request for an extension to this registration deadline on Wednesday. Central Coast areas are among the counties designated eligible for help. Here’s the full list:  If you are eligible, you can register with FEMA by calling 800-621-2262 or by visiting FEMA’s website.
