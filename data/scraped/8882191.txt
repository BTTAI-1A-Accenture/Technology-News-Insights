There are millions of pounds up for grabs again tonight in the Saturday night National Lottery Lotto draw. This weekend's jackpot must be won, so if no one wins the jackpot by matching the six main numbers, there’s a Rolldown. This means the jackpot is shared by players matching two or more main numbers, so thousands can expect to win a boosted cash prize.

You could also win a cash price for matching just three numbers or more - but this is all could be boosted tonight thanks to the Rolldown.
