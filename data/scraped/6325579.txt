Southgate Tower Begins Transformation to Bank Tower Apartments Beztak and Gordon Begin Properties in Farmington Hills will begin transforming the Southgate Tower on Trenton Road into the Bank Tower Apartments on June 26. The one-time headquarters of Security Bank and Trust will have 215 apartments for rent, ranging from studio floor plans to two-story penthouses. The original bank branch space, including the mid-century modern ceiling, will be preserved. There are plans to convert many of the original spaces into functional features, such as converting the truck well into a parking garage, restoring the safety deposit box vault and turning it into a social area, converting the drive-through teller building into an electric vehicle charging station, and one of the drive-through pneumatic tubes will become a unique way for residents to pay rent. The building was purchased in 2021 by an entity owned by members of the Begin family and will be managed by Beztak. âWeâre excited to be developing an extraordinary apartment property offering amazing views in one of Downriverâs most iconic buildings,â says Gordon Begin. âWeâre immensely grateful for the cooperation and assistance that Wayne County and the city of Southgate have provided to make this project possible.â For more information, visit thebanktowerapts.com.

U.S. News & World Report Ranks Childrenâs Hospital of Michigan One of Americaâs Best  Childrenâs Hospital of Michigan in Detroit is ranked as the best in metro Detroit and one of the top hospitals in the country for pediatric care, according to the new U.S. News & World Report rankings for 2023-24. Childrenâs Hospital of Michigan is nationally ranked in four pediatric specialties: cancer, gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery, neurology and neurosurgery, and urology. âChildrenâs Hospital of Michigan has been the go-to hospital for families in southeast Michigan, across the state, and beyond when they need expert help with their kids,â says Archie Drake, CEO of Childrenâs Hospital of Michigan. âTo see that high level of care again recognized by U.S. News & World Report makes me so proud of our physicians, researchers, nurses and staff and they work do every day to care for the children of our communities.â Accounting Today Names Troyâs Rehmann a Top Accounting Firm Rehmann, a fully integrated professional advisory firm in Troy, has been named to Accounting Todayâs list of 2023 Top Firms by assets under management (AUM). Rehmann ranked 18th and was also named a Wealth Magnet, a designation for firms that successfully maintained stability during periods of financial uncertainty. âRehmann boasts a team of dedicated and passionate professionals who understand volatile markets and are committed to helping our clients navigate uncertainty in order to maintain focus on their long-term success,â says Ryan Sullivan, managing director of wealth management at Rehmann. âOur organization has a thorough understanding of what is most important to our clients, and we are proud to have our efforts recognized.â Study: Michigan Becoming Less Attractive for Retirees A study commissioned by metal-res.com shows that over the past five years, Michigan has witnessed a decline in its rankings as a desirable retirement destination, dropping to 29th position overall. Michiganâs high property taxes and rising health care costs have affected its affordability for retirees on fixed incomes. The increasing financial burden of homeownership and health care expenses can make it less attractive as a retirement destination. Furthermore, the stateâs limited access to health care services, especially in rural areas, can be a concern for retirees with specific medical needs. âOver the last five years, weâve witnessed a substantial shift in the retirement landscape across the United States,â says Barry Landry of metal-res.com. âItâs not merely about where retirees are heading now; itâs about recognizing consistent improvement in factors that matter to retirees. This data gives us a deeper understanding of retirement trends and showcases how states are striving to better accommodate our aging population.â U-M, NIH Jointly Invest $79M to Support, Expand DEI Efforts in Biomedical, Health Sciences The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the National Institutes of Health will jointly invest $79 million to support and recruit 30 new faculty members to the Ann Arbor campus as part of a nationwide effort to enhance inclusion and equity across the biomedical and health sciences community. With a five-year, $15.8 million grant awarded this week from NIH, along with a $63.7 million university investment, U-M will launch the Michigan Program for Advancing Cultural Transformation (M-PACT). The program will be led by Professors Robert Sellers and Reshma Jagsi. Administered by the Office of the Vice President for Research, in partnership with the Office of the Provost, M-PACT will recruit 30 new tenure-track assistant professors across 11 schools, colleges and units into three interdisciplinary research clusters: social and behavioral research, basic biomedical research and clinical-translational research. To address persistent and significant underrepresentation of minoritized individuals and groups in the biomedical and health sciences, M-PACT will employ evidence-based recruitment processes to generate candidate pools with diverse social and disciplinary identities. Recruitment efforts will begin this fall, and all new M-PACT scholars will have primary appointments in U-M schools and colleges.

The local recipients are: Families Against Narcotics Launching Hope Not Handcuffs Initiative at Wayne State Families Against Narcotics, a Macomb County-based nonprofit, is teaming up with the Wayne State University Police Department to bring hope to people who struggle with a substance use disorder and want to find recovery.
