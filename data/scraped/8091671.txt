 Unleash your inner word wizard If gaming is a rollercoaster, Cyberpunk 2077 takes you on the wildest ride. Two years ago, the public opinion on Cyberpunk 2077 had soured so much that its developers, the once-infallible CD Projekt RED, could have sunk to the bottom of the sea, never to be seen again. Fast forward to today, it all feels we’ve hopped into a time machine. Cyberpunk 2077 on the PlayStation 5 and/or the Xbox Series S/X (or the PC too) is a totally different beast. We’ve all been there – the early days of Cyberpunk 2077. Dazzling storyline, yes. A Night City that felt like a ghost town? Absolutely. But here’s where it gets juicy: since that current-gen patch rolled out, the game’s glow-up has been nothing short of cinematic. We’re talking movie-quality visuals and a cityscape that’s bustling with life. Dive back in, and it’s not just the graphics that’ll floor you.  Everything from the smoother mechanics to a bug count you can tally on one hand and an experience that’s going to have you glued to your screen – Cyberpunk 2077’s current iteration lives up to the hype. Now, let’s chat about the 2.0 update. Very few expansions and DLCs in gaming can claim to have truly transformed the base game, much more so if we’re talking about free updates. Cyberpunk 2077’s 2.0 finds itself in rare company in that regard. With the Phantom Liberty expansion threatening to barge into the pantheon of all-time post-launch premium content, the latest free update isn’t a minor tweak; it’s a game-changer. It adds new skill trees and takes you to a deep dive into the cyberware world, with changes more than skin deep. For those chasing the thrill of combat, the update has you covered. With the ability to now engage in drive-by’s and shootouts, Night City’s streets have never been more dangerous. And for the tech heads, the Carhacker perk is pure gold. Mess with enemy vehicles, make ’em go boom, or just cruise around with mounted guns. Yep, this isn’t the Cyberpunk you remember. Oh, and let’s not breeze past the cyberware and armor revamps. They’re not just about looking cool anymore (though, trust me, you will). Your choices directly impact gameplay. Want to mix and match your outfits without taking a hit on stats? You got it. The new system ties your armor stats mainly to your cyberware, freeing you up to rock those looks. Exploration has also taken a leap forward. Gone are the days of limitless sprinting. Now, stamina plays a pivotal role, bringing in strategy and making every fight pulse-racingly intense. And the Ripperdocs? Not just NPCs anymore. The overhaul brings them to life, making each cyberware implant feel like a real, gritty surgical procedure. But the real MVP of the 2.0 update? It’s the Night City Police Department. These guys are sharper and smarter. They won’t let you get away with anything. Think GTA vibes with an escalation system tuned to your law-breaking shenanigans. Do too much? Expect a heart-racing chase to ensue. There’s also something to be said about Phantom Liberty. This isn’t your run-of-the-mill expansion. It’s a deep dive into a narrative straight out of a Hollywood blockbuster. At its core, Solomon Reed, voiced by Idris Elba. And let’s be real, compared to the ultra-intense Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand, Elba’s Solomon is a breath of fresh air. He’s the kind of character you’d want to grab a drink with. But here’s the real deal – Phantom Liberty isn’t just a shiny new addition. It’s a promise of what Cyberpunk 2077 can be at its best. Between its enthralling storyline and the expansive 2.0 update, diving back into Night City feels like coming home, but to a place that’s been renovated from top to bottom. If this is what CD Projekt RED has in store for Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel, then we’re all in for quite the treat.  So, for those who’ve been sleeping on Cyberpunk 2077 or perhaps gave it a whirl in its early days, now’s the time to go ahead and jump back in. It’s not just an invitation; it’s a challenge. Ready to take on Night City 2.0?
