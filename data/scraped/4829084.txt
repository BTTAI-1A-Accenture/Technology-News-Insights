The department of telecommunications issued an amendment in Telecom Licenses on March 3, 2021, wherein, all licensees have been directed to connect only trusted products in their telecom networks with effect from June 6, 2021. Spectrum in the mid-band (3,300-3,670 MHz) was recently auctioned for 5G services and the DoT is of the view that reserving it for private networks would result in a loss to the exchequer, according to a senior official. If any company wants to get the spectrum, it should pay a market-determined price for it, is the DoT contention, said this person.
