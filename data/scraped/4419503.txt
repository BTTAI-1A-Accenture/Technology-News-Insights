 The Druid is a new class introduced in Diablo 4 that has quickly emerged as one of the most versatile in the dungeon-crawler franchise. Whether you build a shapeshifting melee or storm spellcaster, there are plenty of viable options for Druid players. Spirit Boons are another mechanic unique to this class that can provide passive benefits for Druids. Druid Spirit Offerings begin spawning after you reach level 15. These small drops can spawn off any defeated enemy and appear completely at random. No matter your build, it is essential to pick up these Offerings whenever they spawn in order to unlock Spirit Boons. If you are trying to figure out what Spirit Boons are, or which Boons to take, this is everything you need to know. Upon reaching level 15 with a Druid character in Diablo 4, you will automatically be given a class-specific quest dubbed ‘Spirits of the Lost Grove.’ Once you complete this short quest, you will be given access to the Spirit Boon mechanic. From this point on, you will be able to collect Spirit Offerings which randomly drop from slain enemies. You should collect these Offerings as often as possible in order to unlock and upgrade Spirit Boons. There are four total Boons to select from: Snake, Eagle, Deer, and Wolf.

For example, the Snake Spirit Boon is exceptionally useful for the Werewolve Druids while Eagle is far better for tank-styled Werebears. Below is a list that shows all four Boons and each unique passive ability:
