From standalone platforms that focus solely on course creation to all-in-one solutions that incorporate marketing and sales features, the landscape of tools to create online courses is vast and diverse. Selecting the best online courses platform for your needs is crucial to your success. Factors such as cost, functionalities, scalability, and user-friendliness should be taken into account when making your decision. With numerous options available, it's essential to understand the different types of platforms and their unique offerings to determine which one aligns best with your goals and target audience. More on that below! Building unbeatable online courses requires choosing the right platform — one that aligns with both your goals and your audience’s needs. So, how did we land on our top pick for the best platforms out there? We doled out careful attention to a range of factors that primarily included: compatibility with course-building facets, customization capabilities, real-world affordability for small-and-mid-sized businesses, evaluation aids support (like quizzes and certifications), and marketing/payment features. Before delving deeper into our selection method, it’s crucial we understand what precisely an ‘online course platform’ involves — it doesn’t refer to learning management systems (LMS). In common lingo, an LMS (learning management system) caters predominantly to educational institutions or corporations intent on advancing their employees’ skills. By contrast, online course platforms are specifically styled for individual creators or businesses looking to generate income by offering courses. Typically, these platforms fall into two categories: There is no magic solution — one size certainly does not fit all in this panorama — hence you’ll need to comprehend what floats your boat before deciding on which type of platform suits you best. Establishing robust judging parameters was central to our methodology while determining the most effective online course platforms. Our grading system predominantly revolved around assisted content formats (like video courses, audio, PDFs, and imagery), editing/customization options available, affordability for small-and-medium businesses, the presence of systems to assess offered courses (such as quizzes or certifications), and the incorporation of marketing/payment features. Proceeding with these benchmarks in mind, we funneled down our list to 21 potentially powerful applications worth trawling through meticulously. Subsequently spending numerous days examining each one closely. We devised a thorough multi-step vetting technique, initiating with registering an account with each platform and journeying through any offered introductory flows. We delved into the core workflow of setting up a new course — right from exploring template options to constructing an all-encompassing curriculum. Concurrently adding course content in various formats to test functionality across diverse media types was a part of this exercise. Examining other vital features such as designing tests/quizzes or certificates, organizing live sessions scheduling drip schedules came next. Followed by experimenting with customization like modifying colors/fonts/logos/landing pages etc. — all subject to individual app permissions. Finally — and importantly — we evaluated their payment/marketing elements: email broadcasts capabilities, pricing structures modeled community building potentialities and SEO support structure availability. When it comes to selecting the best online course platform for your needs, several factors come into play. First and foremost, you should consider the type of media you intend to use in your course, as well as your preferred email service providers, list-building solutions, and funnel tools. Additionally, it's essential to examine the platform's pricing structure and determine whether it aligns with your budget and revenue goals. Scalability is another crucial factor to consider when choosing a platform. As your online course business grows, you'll need a platform that can easily accommodate the increasing number of students, courses, and features. Ensuring that the platform has the potential to scale with your online course business and support your long-term goals is critical. Furthermore, ease of use should not be overlooked, as an intuitive and user-friendly platform will enhance your course creation experience and streamline the learning process for your students. Ultimately, selecting the right course platform requires careful evaluation of your goals, target audience, and desired features, as well as a thorough understanding of the platform's pricing, scalability, and ease of use. By taking these factors into account and conducting thorough research, you'll be well-equipped to make an informed decision and choose the platform that best aligns with your needs and objectives. Online course platforms can be broadly categorized into four main types: standalone, all-in-one, marketplace, and small business/B2B. Standalone platforms, such as LearnWorlds, Thinkific, Teachable, and Kajabi, focus primarily on course creation and management, providing increased flexibility and autonomy in managing learning materials and customizing the design and appearance of your course presentation. Some popular standalone platforms include EasyGenerator, Podia, WizIQ, and Academy of Mine. All-in-one courseware platforms, on the other hand, offer a comprehensive suite of features for creating and selling online courses, managing web presence, and distributing digital products. Examples of all-in-one platforms include Thinkific, Kajabi, New Zenler, Podia, and LearnWorlds. These platforms may not be as advanced in terms of online course creation and management as standalone platforms, but they provide a more powerful web content management system and built-in email marketing and customer relationship management tools. Best online course marketplace platforms, such as Udemy, allow you to customize your course landing page but offer limited control over other aspects. While most marketplaces provide free publishing, they take a share of course sales, making them a good starting point if you lack an online presence. Course creation software, on the other hand, offers more customization options, allowing you to create branded landing pages, choose from various content formats, and access marketing tools to promote your course. Platforms usually have a fixed monthly fee associated with them. Transaction fees may be charged in some cases. Ultimately, the choice between standalone, all-in-one, marketplace, and B2B platforms comes down to your specific needs, goals, and preferences. Assessing your requirements and evaluating the features, benefits, and limitations of each type will help you make an informed decision and select the best online course platform for your unique situation.

By identifying your objectives and the needs of your target audience, you can better determine which platform features and functionalities are most important to your success. For instance, if your goal is to create an online course that is highly engaging and interactive, you may prioritize platforms that offer advanced multimedia capabilities and online community building features. Additionally, consider the specific requirements of your target audience, such as their preferred learning styles, accessibility needs, and technology preferences. By catering to the unique needs and preferences of your audience, you can ensure a positive learning experience and increase the likelihood of success for your online business.

This includes assessing the platform's usability, customization options, potential for community building and student engagement, course quality, and cost. When comparing platform features, consider the type of media you intend to use in your course, as well as your preferred email service providers, list-building solutions, funnel tools, and Zapier. Furthermore, examine the platform's pricing structure and determine whether it aligns with your budget and revenue goals.
