Elon Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink has approached one of the biggest US neurosurgery centres as a potential clinical trials partner as it prepares to test its devices on humans once regulators allow for it. Elon Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink has approached one of the biggest US neurosurgery centres as a potential clinical trials partner as it prepares to test its devices on humans once regulators allow for it, according to six people familiar with the matter. Neuralink has been developing brain implants since 2016 it hopes will eventually be a cure for intractable conditions such as paralysis and blindness. It suffered a blow in early 2022, when the US Food and Drug Administration rejected its application to progress to human trials, citing major safety concerns, Reuters reported earlier this month. The company has since been working to address the agency’s concerns, and it is unclear if and when it will be successful. Neuralink has been talking to Barrow Neurological Institute, a Phoenix, Arizona-based neurological disease treatment and research organization, to help carry out the human trials, the sources said. The talks may not result in a team-up. Neuralink has also discussed partnering with other centres, added the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations. Reuters could not verify the latest status of the talks. Neuralink representatives did not respond to requests for comment. Francisco Ponce, director of Barrow’s Center for Neuromodulation and Neurosurgery Residency Program, declined to comment on Neuralink but said Barrow was well-positioned to conduct such implant research because of its long track record in the field. The FDA declined to comment on Neuralink’s efforts to find a partner for its clinical trials. Neuralink’s latest efforts come as it faces two known US federal probes into its practices. The US Department of Agriculture’s Inspector General began looking into potential animal-welfare violations at Neuralink last year. Current and former employees have detailed concerns to Reuters about the company’s rushed animal experiments, resulting in needless suffering and deaths. Read all theÂ
