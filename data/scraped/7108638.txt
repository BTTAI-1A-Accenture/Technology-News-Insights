 News provided by Mar 23, 2023, 06:00 ET Share this article BRAMPTON, ON, March 23, 2023 /CNW/ - MDA Ltd. (TSX: MDA), a leading provider of advanced technology and services to the rapidly expanding global space industry, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. "For MDA, 2022 was a year of strong growth that showcased our ability to leverage our unique competitive position in multiple growing space markets to expand our customer and geographic footprint," said Mike Greenley, Chief Executive Officer of MDA. "We secured a number of strategic contracts including Phase B of the Canadarm3 program, our selection as prime contractor on Globalstar's LEO constellation that supports satellite direct-to-device functionality, several contracts to support US Government programs, and our first sales of commercial products derived from Canadarm3 technology. We also conducted the Mission Critical Design Review for CHORUS, a major milestone in the development of our next generation Earth observation constellation. These  accomplishments reflect tangible progress against our strategic growth plan and position us well for the coming years." "I am also pleased with our fourth quarter performance which demonstrated strong revenue growth and solid profitability as our teams remain focused on execution and delivering on our customer commitments. With a robust opportunity funnel across our businesses, we are well positioned to capitalize on the demand in our end markets."   As a leading space technology provider, we are leveraging our capabilities and expertise to execute on targeted growth strategies across our end markets and business areas. Our strategic initiatives, which span across our three businesses, include expanding our share of the growing constellation market, leveraging our leading robotics technology platform to capitalize on emerging commercial opportunities, and further strengthening our positioning in Geointelligence through the development of our CHORUS Earth observation constellation. We continue to make good progress against our long term strategic plan. MDA is well positioned to capitalize on strong customer demand and robust market activity given our diverse and proven technology offerings. Our growth pipeline is significant and underpinned by existing contract awards of key programs and our book of business is healthy. We see activities ramping up in line with our expectations on the majority of our programs, and are encouraged by the team's solid execution. We continue to closely monitor developments related to supply chain disruptions, and are taking pro-active measures across our three business areas to mitigate the impact on our operations to the extent possible.   For fiscal 2023, we expect full year revenues to be $750 – $800 million, representing robust year over year growth of approximately 20% at the mid-point of guidance. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be $145 – $155 million, representing approximately 19% – 20% adjusted EBITDA margin. We expect capital expenditures to be $220 – $240 million in 2023, primarily comprising of growth investments to support CHORUS and the previously outlined growth initiatives across our three business areas. We expect Q1 2023 revenues to grow by approximately 50% compared to Q1 2022 levels as we continue to execute on our backlog.    KEY INDICATORS SUMMARY Fourth Quarters Ended  Years Ended  (in millions of Canadian dollars, except for ratios)  December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Revenues $ 186.1 $ 115.5 $ 641.2 $ 476.9 Gross profit $ 58.9 $ 45.4 $ 228.4 $ 167.8 Gross margin 31.6 % 39.3 % 35.6 % 35.2 % Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 39.9 $ 26.8 $ 157.9 $ 137.1 Adjusted EBITDA margin(1) 21.4 % 23.2 % 24.6 % 28.7 % As at (in millions of Canadian dollars, except for ratios)  December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021 Backlog $ 1,378.2 $ 864.3 Net debt(1) to Adjusted TTM(2) EBITDA ratio 1.3x 0.4x  (1) As defined in the 'Non-IFRS Financial Measures' section (2) TTM: trailing twelve months REVENUES BY BUSINESS AREA Fourth Quarters Ended  Years Ended  (in millions of Canadian dollars) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Geointelligence $ 53.9 $ 52.8 $ 195.3 $ 190.7 Robotics & Space Operations 47.9 29.9 193.7 132.9 Satellite Systems 84.3 32.8 252.2 153.3 Consolidated revenues $ 186.1 $ 115.5 $ 641.2 $ 476.9 Consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $186.1 million, representing an increase of $70.6 million (or 61.1%) compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The year over year increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues from our Satellite Systems and Robotics & Space Operations businesses. By business area, Q4 2022 revenues in Geointelligence of $53.9 million represents an increase of $1.1 million (or 2.1%) compared to Q4 2021, reflecting steady work volume. Revenues in Robotics & Space Operations of $47.9 million in Q4 2022 represents an $18.0 million (or 60.2%) increase year over year, primarily driven by the higher volume of work performed on the Canadarm3 program. Revenues in Satellite Systems of $84.3 million in the latest quarter were $51.5 million (or 157.0%) higher compared to the same quarter in 2021. The revenue increase was driven by higher levels of activity as new programs ramp up including the Globalstar program which was awarded in Q1 2022. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, consolidated revenues were $641.2 million which were $164.3 million (or 34.5%) higher than the same period in 2021. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by execution on our opening backlog as well as orders added to backlog in 2022, primarily in our Satellite Systems and Robotics & Space Operations businesses. By business area, full year 2022 revenues in Geointelligence of $195.3 million represents an increase of $4.6 million (or 2.4%) compared to 2021, largely driven by modest ramp up in the CSC program throughout 2022. Full year revenues in Robotics & Space Operations of $193.7 million in 2022 represents a $60.8 million (or 45.7%) increase year over year, largely driven by the ramp up of work performed on the Canadarm3 program since the beginning of 2022. Full year revenues in Satellite Systems of $252.2 million in 2022 was $98.9 million (or 64.5%) higher compared to 2021 driven by higher volumes on new programs including the Globalstar program. Gross profit reflects our revenues less cost of revenues. Q4 2022 gross profit of $58.9 million represents a $13.5 million (or 29.7%) increase over Q4 2021, primarily driven by higher volume of work performed year over year. Gross margin in Q4 2022 was 31.6%, which is in line with our expectations as the Company's program mix evolves. Comparatively, gross margin in Q4 2021 was 39.3%, which included a higher percentage of investment tax credits (ITCs) recognized against cost of revenues. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, gross profit of $228.4 million represents a $60.6 million (or 36.1%) increase over 2021. The increase is driven by higher work volume year over year coupled with higher ITCs income recognized which contributed $28.9 million of the $60.6 million increase. Of the higher ITC income recognized in 2022, $16.8 million relates to a resolution of historical claims which were recognized in Q1 2022. These ITCs originated from prior years but were not recognized previously due to the uncertainty around the eligibility of the related costs. Full year gross margin was 35.6% in 2022, which compares to gross margin of 35.2% in 2021. When excluding the impact of the aforementioned $16.8 million resolution of historical ITC claims recognized in 2022, full year gross margin for the current year was 33.0%, in line with our expectations and reflective of strong operating performance throughout 2022.  Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $39.9 million compared to $26.8 million in Q4 2021, representing an increase of $13.1 million (or 48.9%) year over year primarily driven by higher gross profit as we continue to execute on our backlog. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4% in Q4 2022 compared to 23.2% in Q4 2021 consistent with management's expectations. The slight decline in year over year adjusted EBITDA margin is largely driven by lower gross margin in the latest quarter somewhat offset by strong SG&A cost control. For the full year ended December 31, 2022, adjusted EBITDA was $157.9 million which was $20.8 million (or 15.2%) higher than 2021. The full year adjusted EBITDA in 2022 included $16.8 million of ITC income from the aforementioned resolution of historical ITC claims, while the full year adjusted EBITDA in 2021 included $24.8 million of CEWS income. Excluding the impact of the ITCs claims resolution in 2022 and the CEWS income contribution in 2021, adjusted EBITDA improved to $141.1 million in 2022 from $112.3 million in 2021. The increase of $28.8 million is primarily the net effect of an improvement in gross profit of $43.8 million (exclusive of the impact of the historical claims resolution in Q1 2022) offset by increased R&D expenses of $11.7 million and increased SG&A expenses of $1.7 million. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin excluding the aforementioned items was 22.0% in 2022 compared to 23.5% in 2021. Throughout 2022, we demonstrated strong operating performance focusing on program execution and cost control while simultaneously investing in the aforementioned growth initiatives which contributed to higher levels of R&D expenses. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding CEWS income and historical ITCs claims resolution, is summarized below. Fourth Quarters Ended  Years Ended  (in millions of Canadian dollars)  December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA $ 39.9 $ 26.8 $ 157.9 $ 137.1 CEWS income — (0.8) — (24.8) ITCs claims resolution — — (16.8) — Adjusted EBITDA, excluding CEWS and ITCs claims resolution $ 39.9 $ 26.0 $ 141.1 112.3 Adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding CEWS and ITCs claims resolution 21.4 % 22.5 % 22.0 % 23.5 % Backlog Backlog as at December 31, 2022 was $1,378.2 million, an increase of $513.9 million compared to the backlog at December 31, 2021.

This press release refers to certain non-IFRS measures. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, the measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. We use non-IFRS measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, Order Bookings and net debt, to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before: i) depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, ii) provision for (recovery of) income taxes, and iii) interest expense and financing costs. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding to and deducting from EBITDA, as applicable, certain expenses, costs, charges or benefits incurred in such period which in management's view are either not indicative of underlying business performance or impact the ability to assess the operating performance of our business, including i) unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss ii) unrealized gain or loss on financial instruments and iii) share-based compensation expenses, and iv) other items that may arise from time to time. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Order Bookings is the dollar sum of contract values of firm customer contracts. Order Bookings is indicative of firm future revenues; however, it does not provide a guarantee of future net income and provides no information about the timing of future revenue. Net debt is the total carrying amount of long-term debt, as presented in the 2022 Audited Financial Statements, less cash and excluding any lease liabilities. Net debt is a liquidity metric used to determine how well the Company can pay its debt obligations if they were due immediately. This press release may contain forward–looking information within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, which reflects the Company's current expectations regarding future events. Forward–looking information is based on a number of assumptions and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control, which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those that are disclosed in or implied by such forward–looking information. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the factors discussed under "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Information Form (AIF) dated March 23, 2023 and available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
