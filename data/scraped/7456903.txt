Leading the Alternative World Order Reshaping Perspectives and Catalyzing Diplomatic Evolution – Published on: On February 21, Vladimir Putin sent a message to the Federal Assembly, in which he announced the suspension of Russia’s participation in START-3 and preparations for the resumption of nuclear testing.
The above topics, according to a number of experts, could have been added to the President’s speech at the last moment, writes Moskovsky Komsomolets. Since then the statement has been preceded by words on relations with the West, on the special operation, the economy and social policy of Russia.
“The Ministry of Defense and Rosatom must ensure that they are ready to test Russian nuclear weapons. We won’t be the first to do it, but if the United States conducts a test, then we will,” Putin said in the final part. The decision to suspend participation in START-3 was apparently a response to US President Joe Biden’s visit to Kiev and an attempt to predict the content of the US colleague’s speech in Warsaw.
