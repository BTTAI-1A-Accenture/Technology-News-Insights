Luke Fickell and his assistants are blitzing recruits. Not only did Wisconsin’s coaching staff hit the recruiting trail Friday, they did so accompanied by 11 billboards, 10 in Wisconsin and one in the Chicago area. The idea? To highlight current players on the team and the program’s recruiting success since Fickell took over. One of the billboards features “HOMEGROWN BADGERS” and has images of safety Hunter Wohler (Muskego), tailback Braelon Allen (Fond du lac), Fickell, wide receiver Chimere Dike (Waukesha North) and offensive tackle Jack Nelson (Stoughton). According to Brian Lucas, director of football brand communications, members of the revamped recruiting department came up with the idea. Pat Lambert, who came to UW from Cincinnati, reached out to Lucas to get the project started. Ryan Dean in recruiting handled the graphics and Kevin Kluender in marketing secured billboard space. UW will have 11 billboards total on display Friday through Sunday, with the total cost about $7,000.
