It is anticipated that Android will support seamless eSIM transfer through QR codes as Google is developing a feature that will let Android users easily move their eSIM between Android phones with just the use of QR codes. At this year’s MWC in Barcelona, the business declared the creation of eSIM transfer functionality. This functionality has started to appear in the most recent beta builds of Android 14, indicating a forthcoming launch. Shown below is one half of what Google is bringing to Android phones: device-to-device eSIM profile transfers through QR code scanning.You'll also be able to "convert" a pSIM into an eSIM, but this will require carrier backend support (starting with T-Mobile/Deutsche Telekom).… https://t.co/z1Y9nIU8pT The eSIM technology has been around for about a year, but it has recently gained significant traction as a result of Apple’s US launch of iPhones that exclusively accept eSIM cards. Even while the procedure of moving an eSIM across devices has become simpler, it still takes around an hour to process and, in some situations, requires cellular providers’ permission. Since Android will support seamless eSIM transfer through QR codes most recent iPhone generation only accepts eSIMs, Apple has made the process simpler by including a function in iOS that allows eSIM transfers between iPhones. To the credit of the organization, that instrument appears to have performed flawlessly. Apple’s eSIM transfer tool enables customers to transfer an eSIM using their current iPhone and a wireless transfer method that “just works” between the two devices. Google looks to be employing a distinct strategy with Android. Google has begun laying the Android will support seamless eSIM transfer through QR codes groundwork for eSIM transfer Android, which is based on QR codes, under a hidden area of Play Services. The procedure, shown in the illustration below, asks consumers to scan a QR code to begin the transfer process. We could only access the beginning of this feature because the majority is still in development. However, @AssembleDebug was able to find a Fast Pair-like UI that shows prior to QR code scanning, so we can now say that we have access to some of this functionality. According to Google, the process of transferring an eSIM would be as simple as uploading a photograph. According to the developer who discovered this functionality, it is not currently operational. Google appears to be continuing to work on this project. The Pixel 8 Series can be expected to receive this functionality first, with a wider rollout to all other devices running Android 14 following. The eSIM transfer feature is not a surprise because Google first revealed it in February 2023 at the MWC in Barcelona. In some Android beta builds eSIM transfer profiles were also discovered in January by researcher and Android developer Mishaal Rahman. It seems like Google is making eSIM transfers quick and easy. A QR code must be scanned from the newer gadget by the older one, which will display it. Your eSIM should be transmitted without any assistance from your network provider after the backend verification is finished. As of right moment, moving your eSIM across devices is still more complicated than doing it with a real SIM card. As a result, customers who frequently move between devices or international tourists struggle to quickly exchange SIM cards. Due to the fact that an eSIM reduces the amount of holes in the device, phone manufacturers prefer to offer one because it makes phones easier to waterproof. Since the physical SIM tray must be within the phone, it also conserves space inside the device. When a phone is stolen, the eSIM will be helpful because it makes it easier to track the stolen device because the physical SIM can’t be removed.
