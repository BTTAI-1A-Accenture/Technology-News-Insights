Published on Amazon, the e-commerce giant that once promised to deliver anything you want in two days or less, has been losing its edge as the ultimate online shopping destination. Customers are increasingly frustrated and disappointed by the site’s cluttered and confusing interface, unreliable and slow delivery, and low-quality and counterfeit products. One of the main reasons for this decline is that Amazon has shifted its focus from its core e-commerce business to its other ventures, such as cloud computing, advertising, and streaming. As a result, the company has neglected to improve its shopping experience and customer service, and has allowed its platform to be overrun by sponsored listings, unknown brands, fake reviews, and shady sellers. “Amazon is no longer a place where you can go to find anything you want and trust that you will get it at the best price and as fast as possible,” wrote Ian Bogost in The Atlantic. “The company has become so large and sprawling, with interests in so many sectors and countries, that it is difficult to keep track of its various businesses and initiatives—or even to align them with a coherent vision,” added Gilad Edelman in the same publication. Another reason for Amazon’s downfall is that it has failed to keep up with the changing needs and preferences of its customers, who are looking for more personalized, curated, and trustworthy shopping options. Amazon’s algorithm-driven and data-driven approach to selling has made it lose touch with what its customers actually want, and has eroded their loyalty and trust. “The problem is not that Amazon has gotten worse at selling things. The problem is that Amazon has gotten so good at selling things that it doesn’t need to be good at selling things,” argued Derek Thompson in The Atlantic. “Amazon is not really a retailer anymore. It’s a platform for selling ads,” said Jason Del Rey, senior correspondent at Recode. Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce market is also being challenged by its competitors, who are offering better products, services, and prices. For example, Walmart, Target, and Costco have improved their online presence and delivery options, while Shopify, Etsy, and eBay have attracted more niche and loyal customers. Moreover, some customers are opting for more sustainable and ethical shopping alternatives, such as local businesses, farmers markets, and thrift stores. Amazon’s decline in e-commerce is reflected in its slowing growth and shrinking market share. According to eMarketer, Amazon’s share of US e-commerce sales dropped from 42.1% in 2019 to 40.4% in 2020, and is expected to decline further to 39.7% in 2021. Moreover, Amazon’s net sales increased by only 27% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2021, compared to 40% in the same period of 2020. Amazon’s delivery network, which was once its competitive advantage, has also become a source of controversy and criticism. The company relies on its delivery service partners (DSPs), which are independent contractors that deliver packages for the company. However, these DSPs have been accused of violating labor laws, mistreating workers, and causing accidents. “Amazon’s delivery network is built on exploitation and lies,” wrote Lauren Kaori Gurley in Motherboard. “The company has created a system where it can avoid liability for crashes, wage theft, injuries, and deaths that result from the way it pressures drivers to deliver hundreds of packages a day at breakneck speed,” she added. Amazon may still be the largest and most powerful online retailer in the world, but it is no longer the best or the most trusted one. The company has lost its edge as the ultimate online shopping destination, and it may not be able to regain it unless it changes its strategy and priorities.
