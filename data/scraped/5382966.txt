search Former digital strategist joined Nest Seekers in 2019 SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE A digital strategist turned agent is leaving Nest Seekers for The Agency, as the Los Angeles-based firm looks to build up its New York City outpost. Mike Fabbri joined Nest Seekers in 2019 as a member of Ryan Serhant’s then 50-person team. Fabbri stayed on at the firm when Serhant left a year later to launch his eponymous brokerage.  While at Nest Seekers, Fabbri focused on new development sales at buildings like the Etage on the Upper East Side and 145 Central Park North in South Harlem. The agent said he will start with a fresh slate at The Agency and won’t be bringing any business over from Nest Seekers.  “A lot of my business is from my strong referral network globally, so not just in New York, but a lot of West Coast and back and forth,” Fabbri said. “Having that brand established there I think is really helpful, and also just their expansion and their visibility in all these really key global markets.” Before he started selling real estate, Fabbri served as the head of digital and social media at Douglas Elliman and as a brand manager and agent developer at Compass. In 2016, he became an agent at Corcoran, where he was named rookie of the year with his former business partner Scott Francis. The Agency, led by CEO and founder Mauricio Umansky, expanded to the East Coast last year after acquiring Triplemint. The Agency’s New York City office and tri-state operations are headed by Molly Townsend.  The Agency locked down its first new development project in the city in May at Sackman Enterprises’ 15 West 96th Street. “Whenever I feel comfortable, it’s time to make a move and challenge myself,” Fabbri said. “I’ve done well with that in the new development space specifically, and I know [The Agency] is putting a lot of effort into that.”  All rights reserved © 2024 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.
