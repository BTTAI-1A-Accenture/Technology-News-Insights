Two men are accused of running a clandestine drug lab after police raided a home in Sydney's south and seized drugs worth about $12 million. Strike Force Maimura detectives and the riot squad raided the home at Kirrawee about 6.20pm on Tuesday. Two men, aged 24 and 29, fled the home but were arrested nearby and taken to Sutherland Police Station, police said in a statement. Police found about 30kg of methylamphetamine powder, 600 grams of crystal methylamphetamine and 1500ml of liquid methylamphetamine in the house. Specialist officers from the Drug and Firearms Squad's Chemical Operations Unit, Forensic Evidence and Technical Service, Technical and Forensic Support Unit and Fire and the Rescue NSW HAZMAT team were called in to dismantle the lab. Both men were charged with manufacturing and supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. They were refused bail to appear before Sutherland Local Court on Thursday.
