FAQ - New Privacy Policy 'Kennedy' panelists react to Southwest Airlines cancelling and delaying 80% of flights ahead during Christmas holiday.  Southwest Airlines has canceled more than 2,500 flights Wednesday as the company is still reeling from a Christmas weekend winter storm that other major U.S. carriers have already recovered from.  As of this morning, 2,507 Southwest flights have been canceled, compared to just 32 from Spirit Airlines and 24 from JetBlue, according to FlightAware. For Thursday, the airline has canceled another 2,348 flights so far, bringing its two-day cancelation total to nearly 5,000.  "Our plan for the next few days is to fly a reduced schedule and reposition our people and planes," Southwest CEO Bob Jordan said in a video message released Tuesday night. "We are making headway and we are optimistic to be back on track before next week."  Southwest's "highly complex" network was thrown off by the winter storm as dozens of aircraft and crews fell out of position, Jordan explained.  AMERICAN AIRLINES SAYS IT WILL CAP FARES FOR SOME CITIES AMID SOUTHWEST’S HIGH RATE OF CANCELLATIONS  A traveler wades through the field of unclaimed bags at the Southwest Airlines luggage carousels at Denver International Airport on Dec. 27.
