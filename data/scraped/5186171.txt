The Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives Finance (LSDFi) ecosystem has grown substantially this year as Ethereum (ETH) holders increasingly opt to stake their tokens rather than liquidate them. Although the Ethereum Shapella upgrade in April 2023 enabled ETH withdrawals, a recent report from crypto data aggregator CoinGecko reveals a remarkable 58.7-fold expansion in the LSDFi sector since January. By August 2023, LSDFi protocols had locked in a significant 43.7% of the total 26.4 million ETH stake. Lido has emerged as the dominant player among these protocols, securing nearly a third of the total staked market. These growth figures indicate that ETH holders are re-staking their assets to leverage higher yield opportunities, eschewing liquidation. Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) were introduced to facilitate smaller ETH holders‚Äô participation in staking and unlocking liquidity following the launch of the Ethereum Beacon Chain in December 2020. In the initial months of this year, the Total Value Locked (TVL) across the top 10 LSDFi protocols, excluding Lido, surged to over $900 million, signifying a remarkable 5,870% increase in TVL since January 2023. In contrast, the total TVL is decentralized. AgriCoin is a utility token with a clear mission to foster a sustainable, agriculture-centered economy while promoting Japanese agriculture and culture.
