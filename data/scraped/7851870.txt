RevenuesWorldwide revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was led by an increase in revenue from organic growth of $276.8 million, or 7.2%.  Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue, decreased $53.5 million, or 1.4%, primarily reflecting the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022.  The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $211.0 million, or 5.5%.  Reported total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased $12.3 million, or 0.3%, to $3,868.2 million . Organic growth by discipline in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was as follows: 6.0% for Advertising & Media, 11.6% for Precision Marketing, 12.7% for Public Relations, 7.2% for Commerce & Brand Consulting, 6.4% for Healthcare, and 17.0% for Experiential. Execution & Support decreased 2.8%. Organic growth by region in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 was as follows: 5.6% for the United States, 9.9% for the United Kingdom, 5.1% for the Euro Markets & Other Europe, 6.9% for Asia Pacific, 18.2% for Latin America, 7.3% for Other North America, and 32.6% for the Middle East & Africa . ExpensesOperating expenses decreased $7.9 million, or 0.2%, to $3,225.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. The weakening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar reduced operating expenses in the quarter compared to prior year in line with the percentage reduction from changes in foreign currencies on revenue. Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, are comprised of salary and related costs, and third-party service costs.  Salary and service costs decreased $0.1 million to $2,792.0 million .  Salary and related costs decreased $16.4 million, or 0.9%, to $1,853.4 million as the increase related to organic revenue growth and increased headcount was offset by the effects of foreign currency translation. Third-party service costs increased $16.3 million, or 1.8%, to $938.6 million primarily due to an increase in organic revenue. Occupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased $17.2 million, or 6.2%, to $294.4 million, due to an increase in general office expenses resulting from the return of our workforce to the office, partially offset by lower rent. SG&A expenses decreased $25.4 million to $84.5 million, primarily due to lower professional fees, lower marketing related costs, and reductions from the effects of foreign currency translation. Operating ProfitOperating profit increased $20.2 million, or 3.2%, to $642.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  The related operating profit margin was 16.6% compared to 16.1% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, netNet interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased $18.5 million to $25.9 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.  Interest expense increased $2.8 million to $54.4 million, and interest income increased $21.3 million to $28.5 million, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on cash balances and short-term investments. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate of 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 increased from 23.1% in the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily related to the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions in the prior year period. Net Income - Omnicom Group Inc. and Diluted Net Income per ShareNet income - Omnicom Group Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased $13.6 million, or 3.3%, to $429.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

Diluted net income per share of $2.09 increased $0.14, or 7.2%, from $1.95 per share. EBITAEBITA increased $20.0 million, or 3.1%, to $662.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

RevenuesWorldwide revenue growth in 2022 compared to 2021 was led by an increase in revenue from organic growth of $1,346.3 million, or 9.4%.

The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $681.0 million, or 4.8%.  Reported total revenue in 2022 decreased $0.3 million to $14,289.1 million .

Organic growth by region in 2022 compared to 2021 was as follows: 8.7% for the United States, 10.9% for the United Kingdom, 9.7% for the Euro Markets & Other Europe, 6.6% for Asia Pacific, 14.1% for Latin America, 9.2% for Other North America, and 33.2% for the Middle East & Africa . ExpensesOperating expenses in 2022 increased $114.3 million, or 0.9%, to $12,205.8 million compared to 2021. In 2022, operating expenses include charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine of $113.4 million . In 2021, operating expenses were favorably impacted by a $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline. The weakening of most foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar reduced operating expenses for 2022 as compared to the prior year in line with the percentage reduction from changes in foreign currencies on revenue. Salary and service costs, which tend to fluctuate with changes in revenue, are comprised of salary and related costs, and third-party service costs.  In total, salary and service costs decreased $76.1 million, or 0.7%, to $10,325.9 million .  Salary and related costs increased $226.9 million, or 3.3%, to $7,197.9 million due to organic revenue growth and increased headcount. Third-party service costs decreased $303.0 million, or 8.8%, to $3,128.0 million due primarily to dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline in the second quarter of 2021 and the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022. Occupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue than salary and service costs, increased $20.4 million, or 1.8%, to $1,168.6 million, due to an increase in general office expenses resulting from the return of our workforce to the office, partially offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs. SG&A expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 0.3%, to $378.5 million . Operating ProfitOperating profit in 2022 decreased $114.6 million, or 5.2%, to $2,083.3 million compared to 2021.  The related operating profit margin was 14.6% in 2022 compared to 15.4% in 2021.  Operating profit and operating profit margin in 2022 include $113.4 million in charges related to the effects of the war in Ukraine . Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline. Non-GAAP Adjusted operating profit increased 2.3%, and the related margin increased to 15.4% from 15.0%. Interest Expense, netNet interest expense in 2022 decreased $71.2 million to $137.9 million compared to 2021.  Interest expense decreased $27.8 million to $208.6 million, and interest income increased $43.4 million to $70.7 million, primarily as a result of higher interest rates on cash balances and short-term investments. Income TaxesOur effective tax rate of 28.1% in 2022 increased from 24.6% in 2021.  The higher effective tax rate for 2022 was primarily due to the result of the non-deductibility of $113.4 million in charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as an additional increase in income tax expense of $4.8 million related to the disposition of our businesses in Russia . These charges were partially offset by the tax benefit arising from our share-based compensation awards. The effective tax rate for 2021 reflects a nominal tax applied to the book gain on the disposition in the Advertising & Media discipline resulting from the excess of tax over book basis and a reduction in income tax expense of $32.8 million primarily related to the favorable settlements of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions. Net Income - Omnicom Group Inc. and Diluted Net Income per ShareNet income - Omnicom Group Inc. for 2022 decreased $91.3 million, or 6.5%, to $1,316.5 million compared to 2021. Diluted shares outstanding decreased to 207.0 million, or 4.0%, from 215.6 million as a result of net share repurchases.  Diluted net income per share of $6.36 decreased $0.17, or 2.6%, from $6.53 per share.  Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2022 increased 8.5% to $6.93 from $6.39 . EBITAEBITA decreased $114.3 million, or 5.0%, to $2,163.6 million compared to 2021.  The related EBITA margin was 15.1% compared to 15.9% for 2021.  EBITA and EBITA margin in 2022 include $113.4 million in charges related to the effects of the war in Ukraine . Operating profit and operating profit margin for 2021 were favorably impacted by the $50.5 million gain recorded in connection with dispositions in the Advertising & Media discipline. Risks and UncertaintiesGlobal economic challenges, including the impact of the war in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, rising interest rates and supply-chain disruptions could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. The impact of these issues on our business will vary by geographic market and discipline. We monitor economic conditions closely, as well as client revenue levels and other factors. In response to reductions in revenue, we can take actions to align our cost structure with changes in client demand and manage our working capital. However, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of our efforts to mitigate any impact of the current and future adverse economic conditions, reductions in client revenue, changes in client creditworthiness and other developments. Definitions - Components of Revenue ChangeWe use certain terms in describing the components of the change in revenue above.  Foreign exchange rate impact: calculated by translating the current period's local currency revenue using the prior period average exchange rates to derive current period constant currency revenue. The foreign exchange rate impact is the difference between the current period revenue in U.S. Dollars and the current period constant currency revenue. Acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue: Acquisition revenue is calculated as if the acquisition occurred twelve months prior to the acquisition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of acquisitions through the acquisition date. As a result, acquisition revenue excludes the positive or negative difference between our current period revenue subsequent to the acquisition date and the comparable prior period revenue and the positive or negative growth after the acquisition date is attributed to organic growth. Disposition revenue is calculated as if the disposition occurred twelve months prior to the disposition date by aggregating the comparable prior period revenue of disposals through the disposition date. The acquisition revenue and disposition revenue amounts are netted in the description above. Organic growth: calculated by subtracting the foreign exchange rate impact component and the acquisition revenue, net of disposition revenue component from total revenue growth.
