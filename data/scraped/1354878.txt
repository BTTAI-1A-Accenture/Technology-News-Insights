In certain cases, some friends may become enemies, and vice versa. In most cases, it depends on the choice of the players. One such decision that may put some people in a dilemma involves the Black Cat. He is a recurring NPC that players will encounter several times on their mission to find out the truth behind the puppet frenzy.
                         He can be found for the first time in Venigni Works, along with his sister, Red Cat. The siblings will next move to the Malum District, where they will offer to team up against the Black Rabbit Brotherhood, a major boss in Lies of P. Players can choose to accept or reject, but it won't make a drastic difference. Then, they will move to the Grand Exhibition Gallery, whereupon players will find them asking for a Gold Coin Fruit. After giving them the Gold Coin Fruit, players will receive the Quixotic record. The final time, players will encounter the Black Cat in Arche Abbey.
     Since Cartridges can help protect Pinocchio from being damaged by status effects, it's a good idea to always keep one handy.                     During the final interaction, the Black Cat will ask players again for the Gold Coin Fruit. He will reveal that he is going blind and requires the item to heal himself. Once again, players will have two options to pick from. They can decide to Give Gold Coin Fruit or Do Not Give. If players decide to give the Black Cat the Gold Coin Fruit, they will receive the Black Cat Mask.
                     Alternatively, they can decide not to give the Gold Coin Fruit to the Black Cat, which will trigger a fight. The Black Cat is a formidable opponent, but he can be taken down with the help of some planning. He wields a spear, which has a decent reach. Since he is a human enemy, players can use the following items to make the fight easier:
                         With the help of these things, it will be much easier to defeat the Black Cat. Depending on their build, players can either use a greatsword with Aegis to defeat him. Or they can use their speed to dodge the attacks and then counterattack. Enhancing the weapon with the Acid Grindstone will increase the amount of damage dealt significantly. So, it is something that players should use. After the Black Cat has been defeated, he will drop the Black Cat Mask.
      
                      It is much better to avoid fighting this opponent, as it will cause the Red Fox to attack players.
