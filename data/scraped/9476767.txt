By leveraging Total Expert, financial institutions can identify more sales opportunities, extend the personalization and customization of prospecting and marketing activities, and act quickly on customer intelligence data to attract more borrowers, close more deals, and create happier, more loyal customers.  The Total Expert platform powered more than 2.1M mortgage loans in 2022, representing 36% of total U.S. home loan volume, making it the most widely used intelligent marketing automation and customer engagement platform for loan officers. Based on each bank, credit union, or mortgage company’s contacts in Salesforce, Total Expert sends alerts via its Customer Intelligence solution. Customer Intelligence notifies users if any of their monitored contacts pass an equity threshold, list their home on the market, could benefit from a current rate, or when another lender pulls their credit. These actions are directly surfaced into existing Salesforce workflows and allow teams to reach out quickly to potential borrowers that may be ripe for opportunity. In addition to Customer Intelligence, other Total Expert features now available include: Total Expert has simplified how loan officers access approved and compliant marketing and prospecting materials, making it even easier to follow up on flagged leads, customize the materials based on the alerts, and close more deals.  1333 New Hampshire Avenue NWWashington, DC 20036 Follow ABA on X Follow ABA on Facebook Follow ABA on Linkedin Follow ABA on YouTube Follow ABA on Instagram Follow ABA on Email Bulletins © 2024 American Bankers Association
