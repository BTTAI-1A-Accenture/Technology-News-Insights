 General Dynamics' IT services unit has booked a potential 12-year, $1.7 billion contract to update virtual flight simulators for the Army in support of training initiatives. GDIT's work will support the Flight School XXI program that trains approximately trains approximately 4,000 entry level and graduate level students per year, the company said Tuesday. Flight School XXI is the Army's main training program for all of its rotary wing aviation personnel. The Army Aviation Center of Excellence oversees Flight School XXI and has tasked GDIT to provide new simulation technology for training students at the facility in Fort Rucker, Alabama. GDIT will own, operate, maintain and update virtual flight simulators. The company will also be responsible for training and program management services at Fort Rucker. “We have partnered with the U.S. Army for nearly two decades and provided more than 1 million hours of simulation training,” GDIT President Amy Gilliland said in release. The Army finalized the award to GDIT in late March, for which the company was the lone bidder.
