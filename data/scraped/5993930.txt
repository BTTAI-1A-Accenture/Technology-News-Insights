Fight Out will be the next big M2E coin to hit the market and we’re predicting it could soon head the market. The presale backs up our prediction as over $3 million has already been raised, despite it being still very early in its existence. Fight Out’s aim is to combine the best that traditional gyms and fitness apps provide while also fixing their faults. The app will give users a personalized working experience that takes into account everything they need for a well rounded fitness experience. They are also building their own gyms worldwide and partnering with existing ones. This will give users the option to workout in the comfort of their own home or attend their state of the art gyms and train with like minded individuals.

So, finding the best Metaverse coin is crucial for investors. We have two on this list and the first is RobotEra. We love the concept of this game as players are expected to purchase land on the destroyed planet of Taro and begin to rebuild it. RobotEra is a P2E game with a twist. You don’t just get in-game currency for completing tasks, instead the inventors use the metaverse to create a virtual economy. Players can make money by building structures that other players will want to visit then charge them for that right. They will also be able to sell space for advertisements, and do anything else they think may raise funds, so it is of players best interests to build the best community they can.

The coin has recently been launched on various exchanges like Gate.io and many others.  The main feature that people seem to love about the platform is the extra distance they are going for their investors. Not only do they supply you with the best buy and sell options on the market but they also put the power in your hands by giving you trading strategies and passing on important information like social sentiment on coins and presales.
