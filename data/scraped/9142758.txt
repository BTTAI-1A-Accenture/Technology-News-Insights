Footy Headlines released two images of the rumoured United away kit for next campaign - with the jersey set to feature bold vertical stripes. The report claims that the 2023/24 away shirt combines a 'very dark green main colour' with white and maroon. It would certainly be a unique and uncommon design and colour combination if it is indeed the official kit for next season, especially considering that the Adidas logo and United crest sit in the centre of the shirt.

Interestingly, the kit does not feature a main shirt sponsor, with United recently having reached an agreement with TeamViewer to allow the club to look for a new front-of-shirt sponsor. The German software company's five-year partnership with United was due to run until 2026, in a deal reported to be worth Â£47million per year.
