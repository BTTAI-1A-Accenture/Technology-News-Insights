Over and Above fundraiser Julie Whitton said: “David is our Caroline Thorpe Ward superhero. Every year he brings in a wide range of toys for all ages – superhero figures, dolls, cars, tractors, toy dinosaurs –there is something suitable for every child ensuring no one gets missed. He brightens up the ward helping us to bring a smile to children spending time in hospital around Christmas time.” David said: “My brother Shaun died in 2019 and he used to love celebrating Christmas. After he died I decided I wanted to spread some Christmas joy by giving Christmas presents to children who are less fortunate. “I raise the money by doing gardening and odd jobs for people and I receive a good discount from the Entertainer toy shop in Barnstaple High Street. It means a lot to me that the toys help spread some of that joy.”
