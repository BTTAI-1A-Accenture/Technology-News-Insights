Japan beats Spain 2-1 to advance to last 16 at World Cup

See in context
 Those who say Spain intentionally let Japan  win didn't watch this game. It was very hard fought, the whole way throught, with Spain fighting to win at every point. Spain knew that it was theoretically possible for them to not go through when Costa Rica went ahead of Germany, 2-1, but that did not change their style in the slightest. This Spanish team is proud of its excellent skills and fighting spirit, and would never cynically let another team win to avoid playing a supposedly strong team like Argentina or Brazil later. That is pure nonsense. 0

 Those who say the ball was out of bounds on Japan's second goal underestimate the technology the VAR has available. The latest, most accurate photo's show a thin edge, perhaps half a centimeter of the ball above the white line, meaning it was still in play... 5

 Wow! Watched the game from The Netherlands, and during the first half thought: Spain is so dominating, leading 1-0, this is going to be a runaway for Spain... But wait! The game repeated Japan's second half response against Germany, and scored twice! What??? Are you kidding me??? But they did it, with clever steals, great passes, two great goals (the second a nail-biter waiting for the VAR to call the ball in bounds (by half a centimeter, it looks like))... Japan held on, even with an inflated 7 minute extension of regular time... And won the game!!!! Wow!!! What a sensation!!! The Japanese fans in tears of shocked happineness and relief!!! Great!!! Morocco is also unexpectedly through... So: good news for Africa and Asia!!! This tournament is TOP ENTERTAINMENT!!! Japan could go far!!!... I hope they do!!! 9
