The Russian governor of the largest city in Crimea says that Ukrainian forces attacked Russia's main naval base in the region using exploding sea drones on Monday morning. Mikhail Razvozhayev, the Moscow-appointed governor of Sevastopol in Crimea, said on Telegram Monday morning that the attack on the naval base in Sevastopol started at 3:30 a.m. He said that Russian forces destroyed one sea drone and that a second drone exploded on its own. No one was injured in the attack, Razvozhayev said, adding that the incident happened in the harbor off of Sevastopol and that the drones didn't make their way into Streletskaya Bay.  He said the blast from the drone's explosion broke windows on four residential buildings, and he ordered Vice-Governor Evgeny Sergeevich Gorlov to manage the damage. "Now the city is quiet," Razvozhayev said. "But all forces and services are in a state of combat readiness." Ukrainian officials have not commented on the attack, though Reuters reported that Ukraine doesn't usually claim responsibility for attacks on Sevastopol, which is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine but was annexed along with the rest of the Crimean peninsula by Russia in 2014. Russian officials have accused Ukraine of carrying out multiple attacks on Sevastopol since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.  In July, Russia claimed a drone attack on its Black Sea fleet headquarters in Sevastopol injured six people. At the time, Ukraine denied responsibility for the attack. Translations by Oleksandr Vynogradov
