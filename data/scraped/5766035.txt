Samsung SDS, a systems development company established in 1985 under Samsung Electronics, is mainly responsible for systems operations for group companies.    The company, which has been expanding through buying out group companies specializing in information technology, debuted on the Korean exchange in November 2014.    A number of IT leaders have been produced by the company, including the founder of South Korea's Naver, developer of the Line free message application highly popular in Japan and other Asian countries.    The company's current goal is to push up the sales to 20 trillion won by 2020. It hopes to significantly expand business with outside customers by tapping into the know-how and expertise accumulated through relations with group companies assisting with matters such as enhancing productivity through system improvements.    It also focuses on contract logistics systems operations and security technologies to be used to link a fingerprint authentication system for mobile headset.    Its main shareholders include not only group companies such as Samsung Electronics but also Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and the third-generation leader of the founding family. It is one of the few group companies where the founding family directly owns stock. The business, therefore, is recognized not just as another operation, but as a possible core unit for reorganizing the entire group. Discover the all new Nikkei Asia app
