 Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly been adopted by financial services firms globally. The technology is being used to streamline operations, improve customer service, and increase profitability. Here are some examples of where AI is being adopted within financial services and some supporting data points and graphs: Fraud Detection: Financial services firms are using AI to detect and prevent fraud in real-time. According to Juniper Research, AI-powered fraud detection will save the banking industry $22 billion by 2023. Customer Service: Chatbots are being used by banks to improve customer service and reduce wait times. According to a survey by Accenture, 86% of financial services executives believe that AI-powered chatbots will be the primary way customers interact with their organizations in the next three years. Investment Management: AI is being used to automate investment management processes, such as portfolio management and risk assessment. According to a report by PwC, the use of AI in asset management is expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2018 to $9.2 billion by 2025. Credit Risk Assessment: AI is being used to assess credit risk more accurately and efficiently. According to a report by McKinsey, banks that use AI in credit risk assessment could see a reduction in loan losses of up to 10%. Trading and Market Analysis: AI is being used to analyze market data and predict trends, providing traders with valuable insights. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global AI in the fintech market is expected to grow from $1.3 billion in 2018 to $7.3 billion by 2022. Overall, AI is being adopted across various areas in financial services, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years as firms look for ways to improve efficiency and gain a competitive edge. How does this change the jobs market? This to follow…. Program Manager | Transformation Expert | Delivery Expert Looking at the Transformation and general Program space, AI will naturally play a significant role going forward. Digital Transformations will be focused on AI-driven technology rather than the more 'basic' technologies we have seen over the last 15 years. Hence if you are working in Program Delivery or adjacent services you have to understand the basics and be able to distinguish between the different applications and subfields of AI to be able to support your client/employer appropriately. Iterative delivery models (yes, I am actively avoiding the term agile) will become standard as I can't see doing AI implementations and ongoing management in any type of waterfall'y way. Helping people and organisations in their data journey leveraging Microsoft Data and AI solutions Parveen Kumar we were talking about this yesterday mate. Helping people and organisations in their data journey leveraging Microsoft Data and AI solutions not entirely FSI related but kind of, did you see this, James Holland? https://www.afr.com/technology/ato-captures-billions-of-dollars-from-tax-cheats-with-ai-20230727-p5drnf NSW State Director | Recruiting Technology & Digital Leaders | Executive Search Improved efficiency and effective decision making. 

But big questions on 
- What data (and biases) the AI is trained on?
