			Trending:		 Denver’s 14th annual 303 Day — honoring the state’s original area code — arrives Friday, March 3, with noticeably fewer deals than last year. Lots of businesses aren’t as desperate for your pandemic-softening dollars, which means more straight-up free events, and fewer 303 Day-specific promotions to get people in the door. This year’s 303 Day also falls on the start of Denver Restaurant Week, which runs March 3-12, and the gallery scene’s First Friday art-crawl. It’s safe to say many of these businesses don’t want to split your attention as they sell fine art, tasty prix fixe menus and bespoke cocktails. As always, 303 Day’s city-booster promotions are designed to show Denver’s best angles, and there are a lot of them.
