April 14, 2023 The majority of the world's esports participants and spectators live in Asia. When it comes to big competitive games like Dota 2, CS: GO, League of Legends, and VALORANT, Asians are the undisputed leader in the world.  Some forms of esports are unique to East and Southeast parts, giving them an additional edge in mobile gaming. What factors point to Asia as the current frontrunner in the esports industry? The number of viewers, money, and potential for game development and esports scene innovation are all relevant things to consider during the season. Let’s dive deeper into this topic.  East Asia Dominates All Esports Leagues Most esports games recognize Asian nations like China and South Korea as regions, like North America. Unlike Europe, Africa, Oceania, and LATAM compete for restricted seeding spots at every international tournament.  Asia esports has the most fans and money. Twitch, Facebook Gaming, Discord, and YouTube have 700 million esports viewers during peak seasons. The US ranks second after China, Japan, and South Korea. The Asian continent's dominance in international esports competitions is largely responsible for the region's burgeoning esports industry. Most team-based esports contests are dominated by China and South Korea, while Japan is at the forefront of combat and card games.  First-person shooter (FPS) games are more successful in North America and Latin America, whereas Europe is more well-rounded than its Eastern and Western competitors.  However, Africa's esports community has been noticeably absent from major international competitions, suggesting that they still need more time to mature. When analyzing the gaming prowess of Asians, the question "why are Asians so excellent at video games?" or "why does Asia dominate esports?" usually comes up. The pervasiveness of gaming in their society explains their prowess at the game. Most teens and young people in Asia spend time at gaming computer stores, honing their abilities and hoping to discover an esports community. These companies fund community tournament teams. It opens up pro gaming to everyone, boosting Asian esports. Southeast Asia Embracing Esports Niko Partners and Gamescom Asia have released research that explores the unique characteristics of the Southeast Asian industry.  Niko Partners predicts that Asia's 1.47 billion gamers will generate $82 billion for the world economy this year from mobile and PC gaming revenue, making up 55% of the global total.  While South Korea, Japan, and China are the continent's largest gaming markets, the six main Southeast Asian nations:  Account for 19% of the continent's overall gaming revenue ($5 billion) and players (270 million). According to industry analysts, the Southeast Asian games market will develop at a CAGR of 8.6% during 2020–2025.  A multitude of macroeconomic variables, including improvements in infrastructure, investments by governments and multinational firms, and rising disposable income, have contributed to this robust expansion. Southeast Asia Dominates Mobile Esports While mainland China, South Korea, and Japan have garnered acclaim for their prowess in console esports, Southeast Asia has emerged as a global powerhouse in mobile gaming, hosting dozens of tournaments every year. These are currently the most played mobile games: Game About PUBG Mobile PUBG Corporation licensed Player Unknown's Battlegrounds for Android and iOS. LightSpeed & Quantum was created and Tencent launched it on mobile devices globally. The Game Awards nominated PUBG Mobile for Best Mobile Game and developed pro leagues in the Middle East, South, and Southeast Asia. America and Europe have robust esports scenes. League of Legends: Wild Rift Wild Rift is Riot Games' mobile adaptation of League of Legends. In 2022, it held its first major international competition named Icons, and three of the eight teams that advanced to the elimination round were from in Southeast Asia. Of the five, four are Chinese and one is South Korean. Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Moonton Games' Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is another esports game that is only available in Southeast Asia. Due to its inclusion in the SEA Games 2022 in Vietnam, it is widely considered to be the most formidable rival to Wild Rift and Arena of Valor in the Asian region. Arena of Valor TiMi Studio Group and Level Infinite's Arena of Valor is the only game of its kind in almost every yearly cross-country competition held in Southeast Asia. As one of the best mobile esports titles, it is a shame that it is not more widely available outside of Asia.

Women constitute approximately 40% of gamers in the area, whereas Singapore and Indonesia have lower gaps. The mobile market's cross-gender appeal is shown in the region's almost equal presence.
