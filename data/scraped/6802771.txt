If there’s one thing that can be said for sure, it’s that the global economy has not seen a year of consistency since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic at the tail end of 2019. Courtesy of globalization and rapid advancements in communications and transportation, the world is connected in ways that people living just a hundred years ago would have thought unimaginable. The dominance of the developed world, made of countries primarily in North America and Europe in the global economy has shifted over the past two decades as Western firms have shifted to the East to enjoy low manufacturing costs and improve their margins. This shift also leads to an interconnected economy which sees firms rely on thousands of companies in different countries as part of their supply chains. As an illustration, consider one of the world’s most popular products, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone. Widely credited to having disrupted the smartphone industry in 2007, Apple has gained meteoric success due to the iPhone, and the firm relies on its global supply chain to ship the smartphone not only to Americans’ hands but also to citizens of other countries. Apple’s latest data shows that the firm relies on 200 companies to procure and manufacture materials for its products, and these operate through more than 600 production facilities all over the world. Most of these are spread over several Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan, and China. So, any disruption in the global transportation network risks affecting Apple’s operations, which in turn can kick off a chain reaction where other companies that rely on the Cupertino, California technology giant for their revenue can also see their coffers dry up. While Apple is just a single example of global interconnection, manufacturing, and operations are not the only industries that are dependent on each other’s performance in different regions. One of the most sensitive and highly connected industries is finance. Just like supply chains, manufacturing, and operations have benefited from connectivity, the financial world of today is vastly different from the time when Aaron Burr Jr., the third vice president of America, set up the Manhattan Company as a bank in New York in 1799.  This bank would eventually go on to become the world’s largest private bank in terms of net assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). News travels in the blink of an eye, and any uncertainty about the economic environment of giants thousands of miles away can impact stocks and securities trading in America. This trend of global reliance and interconnections affecting foreign markets is quite in play these days. China, one of the largest economies in the world, is seeing weak economic growth and this is causing the U.S. dollar to shoot up against a basket of international currencies that are typically dubbed together as the dollar index. This is because Chinese economic growth is a large contributor to global economic growth, and if the country fails to live up to investor expectations, then money flows towards the safe haven U.S. dollar due to fears that other assets might not perform so well in a weak growth environment. And since we’re on the topic of global growth, a fresh report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) paints a rather gloomy picture. As we mentioned above, the global economy really hasn’t been the same since the coronavirus pandemic. There are several additional reasons for this apart from the supply outages and lock downs disrupting businesses and the way of life. One of the biggest hurdles to economic growth is the high interest rate environment that America and the world have entered as central banks try to curtail soaring inflation due to lax monetary policies and market disruptions such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The OECD believes that global economic growth is expected to slow down to 2.7% next year, slipping from the already slow 3% growth expected by the end of 2023. The two biggest contributors to this are oil prices – up by 25% since May and the tough interest rate environment. Quoted by Bloomberg, the OECD’s Chief Economist Clare Lombardelli shared at a news conference: After a stronger-than-expected start to 2023, helped by lower energy prices and the reopening of China, global growth is expected to moderate. The impact of tighter monetary policy is becoming increasingly visible, business and consumer confidence have turned down, and the rebound in China has faded.
