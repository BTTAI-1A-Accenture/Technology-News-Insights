If he‚Äôs needed, Burnie will be there. The Miami Heat mascot, after reportedly taking a trip to the emergency room after being punched by MMA fighter Conor McGregor during a promotional stunt on Friday night, is available for Game 6 of the NBA Finals. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the Miami Heat toughness that we‚Äôre talking about,‚Äù Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said, laughing, on Sunday from Denver. ‚ÄúHe should have been allowed to take the first swing. We won‚Äôt reveal who that is, but yeah, he can take a punch and get back up. He‚Äôs not going to miss any time.‚Äù During the third quarter of the Nuggets‚Äô win in Game 4 on Friday night, Burnie was on the court with McGregor to help him promote a pain relief spray. Burnie squared up with McGregor while wearing a pair of fake boxing gloves when McGregor knocked him out with a left hook. Once Burnie was down on the court, McGregor hit him in the head a second time before spraying him with the pain spray. Burnie was eventually dragged off the floor by Heat staffers.

Though it was a promotional stunt, McGregor appears to have taken it too far. It‚Äôs unclear if he‚Äôll face any consequences as a result. McGregor hasn‚Äôt fought since 2021, when he broke his tibia in the first round of a rematch with Dustin Poirier. He has just one KO since 2016, and has fought in the UFC only four times since then. He is currently set to take on Michael Chandler next. The Nuggets beat the Heat 108-95 on Friday in Miami to take a 3-1 series lead. They‚Äôll host the Heat on Monday night in Game 5, where they can win their first NBA title. If Miami wins, Game 6 of the series will be on Thursday night in South Florida ... where Burnie awaits.
