The sickening incident happened at around 6.20am on Sunday when the OAP was assaulted in the Pyramids Business Park, Easter Inch Steadings, Bathgate. Three men approached the man from an opening leading to the public footpath that crosses the M8 Flyover bridge from Blackburn where they proceeded to verbally and physically assault him. They then ran away in the direction of Blackburn Road/Wester Inch, Bathgate across the dual carriageway (A7066). All three are described as in their early twenties with local accents and wearing dark hooded tops with hoods covering their faces and dark coloured jeans.
