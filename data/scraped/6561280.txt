Profitability continues to be the buzzword among the listed and private new-age tech or internet companies. From achieving operating profitability, most of these companies are now proactively guiding towards PAT level profitability.  While the longer-term growth and margin expansion story holds, the brokerage sees limited upside in the near-term for some stocks that have shown strong exuberance recently.  However, it expects stocks to react more to leading indicators for Q3 considering the festive season and world cup combo would result in strong seasonality for companies such as Zomato, Nykaa, CarTrade Tech, Delhivery, EaseMyTrip and Affle (India). JM Financial expects sequential paid subscription additions of only around 4,500 in Q2FY24 versus management guidance of 5,000 - 6,000, as a result of recent price hikes and high base of last year subscriber additions. IndiaMart InterMesh is expected to deliver a strong revenue growth of 25% YoY in Q2FY24 driven by strong volume as well as ARPU increase. It expects EBITDA margin expansion of 60 bps YoY to 28.5% with EBITDA growth of 27% YoY and net profit growth of 18% YoY. The brokerage has a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of  ₹3,300 per share, implying an upside of 16.4% from Wednesday’s closing price.

The brokerage has a ‘Buy’ rating on Just Dial and a target of  ₹830 per share.  According to the brokerage firm, recent price hikes by the company as well as the competition could lead to higher revenue contribution from B2B campaigns.  Further, it sees profitability trends to continue to recover (from the Covid lows) driven by improvement in productivity of the sales team, controlled A&P spend and scaling back of investments towards new initiatives. In the Food Delivery business, JM Financial forecasts sequential GOV growth of 4% (+15% YoY) amidst increased competitive intensity. It expects Zomato’s reported revenue growth would be relatively higher than GOV growth due to the recent improvement in take-rates. At a consolidated level, it sees Zomato’s reported EBITDA loss narrowing down to  ₹6 crore in Q2 versus a loss of  ₹48 crore in Q1.  The brokerage firm has a ‘Buy’ rating on Zomato with a target price of  ₹115 per share.
