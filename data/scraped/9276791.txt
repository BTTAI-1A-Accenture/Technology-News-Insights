As global challenges like climate change, social inequality, and resource depletion continue to escalate, it is crucial for finance professionals to embrace sustainability as a guiding principle. By integrating sustainability education into their frameworks, we can equip finance professionals with the knowledge and tools necessary to drive positive change. Olivier Boutelllis-Taft, CEO, Accountancy Europe  Why does sustainability education matter? Well, it matters because we’ve been ignoring it totally for the past 200 years, and most of us, if we’re honest, still understand pretty little about it, including often, those who think they do.  Finance professionals are uniquely positioned to drive sustainable practices within organizations due to their deep understanding of financial intricacies. Their expertise in risk management, strategic planning, and resource allocation is invaluable in navigating the complex sustainability challenges faced by modern businesses. By harnessing their existing skills and leveraging their analytical prowess, finance professionals can become catalysts for positive change, influencing decisions that benefit both the bottom line and the planet. However, to fully unlock their potential, finance professionals must adopt new skills, behaviours, and mindsets. They need to broaden their horizons beyond traditional financial analysis and embrace a comprehensive understanding of sustainability principles. This expanded skill set includes proficiency in sustainability reporting, impact measurement, sustainable investing, and a deep understanding of how sustainability issues impact business performance. Recognizing the urgency and significance of this paradigm shift, finance professionals must embrace a continuous learning mindset. Education becomes the cornerstone of their journey towards sustainable operations. As the reporting landscape evolves, professionals must expand their knowledge to effectively interpret and utilize diverse types of information and data. By upskilling in areas such as data analytics, technological advancements, and regulatory frameworks, finance professionals can make informed decisions that align financial objectives with broader environmental and social goals. Clemence Lecat-David, Senior Manager Accounting Expertise, Unilever  We already have a lot of skills we can use but equally, we need to adopt a very different mindset… because we really need to understand the aim of the reporting, so we are able to make the switch.  On June 8, 2023, a collaborative event between the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Accountancy Europe (AcE), and the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) brought together educators, experts, and industry leaders to shed light on the changing reporting landscape and the imperative for finance professionals to acquire new skills, behaviours, and mindsets. Anne-Marie Vitale, Chair of IFAC’s International Panel on Accountancy Education opened the event, followed by panel discussion, chaired by Sharon Machado, Head of Sustainable Business at ACCA, with closing remarks were provided by Olivier Boutellis-Taft, CEO Accountancy Europe. Panellists included: Clemence provided insight into her evolving role, the shifting regulatory landscape, and the skills needed for success. Adriana set out some key findings from a survey conducted by Professional Accountancy Education Europe and shed light on how sustainability currently fits within professional education and training for accountants and auditors. Bianca shared background on the importance of developing skills within finance professionals, financial service providers, and intermediaries to facilitate consumer protection and empowerment, and introduced the EU and OECD-INFE Financial competence framework, which aims to provide a common framework to inform the development of financial literacy policies and programmes, and identify gaps in the provision of training. Mardi shared her insights into what regulations such as the IFRS S1 and S2 mean for finance professionals and CFOs, and expanded on the work of the International Sustainability Standards Board on capacity building, and the supporting role of professional bodies, talent development functions and wider professionals.

Everyone needs these skills, everybody in every role in every organisation is going to need to evolve their current skill set to include green skills if we’re really going to transition to a more sustainable world, but more sustainable business and markets as well.  The event served as a stark reminder that the traditional boundaries of financial reporting are rapidly expanding. Sustainability concerns have taken centre stage, demanding a holistic approach to reporting that encompasses sustainability factors alongside financial metrics. To support finance professionals in their growth and development, organizations such as ACCA are actively working to build educational platforms and materials for finance professionals. These platforms aim to bridge the knowledge gap and equip professionals with the tools and insights necessary to navigate the intricacies of sustainability reporting. ACCA educational materials can be found here: Accounting for a better world | ACCA Global.  The importance of collaboration and knowledge-sharing cannot be overstated. Industry conferences, workshops, and forums provide invaluable opportunities for finance professionals to network, exchange ideas, and learn from each other’s experiences. These platforms foster a vibrant community of professionals dedicated to driving sustainable finance forward. By engaging in cross-sectoral dialogues and building partnerships, finance professionals can leverage collective expertise to overcome challenges and seize opportunities. As we navigate the complexities of the 21st century, it is imperative that finance professionals embrace sustainability as an integral part of their practice. Only through collective action and education can we unlock the potential for finance to be a force for good, generating value not just for shareholders, but for the planet and all its inhabitants.
