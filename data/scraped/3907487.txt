  This nutritious oil is rich in protective compounds that positively impact health in several ways, including protecting against heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
  It’s an important component of the Mediterranean diet, which is considered one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world.
  Here’s everything you need to know about olive oil, including its nutrition, possible health benefits, and how to add it to your diet. 
  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. Diet and lifestyle choices can help lower your risk of heart disease by promoting healthy blood lipid levels, blood pressure, improving blood vessel function, and preventing atherosclerosis.
  Atherosclerosis is the medical term for the thickening or hardening of the arteries caused by a buildup of plaque. Plaque is formed slowly over time as fats, blood cells, cholesterol, and other substances build up in your arteries, restricting blood flow. Atherosclerosis is the main cause of heart disease.
  Diets rich in olive oil, such as the eating patterns of people living along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, have been shown to protect against heart disease risk factors like atherosclerosis. 
  Olive oil contains compounds, including phenolic antioxidants, that decrease the production of inflammatory molecules that promote atherosclerosis. For example, oleuropein is a phenolic compound found in olive oil that helps reduce inflammation and inhibits the expression of adhesion molecules, which play key roles in the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
  Studies show that diets rich in olive oil may help reduce the progression of atherosclerosis. A 2021 study that included 939 people with heart disease found that the participants who followed an olive oil-rich Mediterranean diet for seven years had decreased atherosclerosis progression, as measured by the thickness of the inner two layers of the carotid artery (IMT-CC) and plaque height in the carotid artery, compared to those who followed a low-fat diet.
  Additionally, regularly consuming olive oil may help reduce LDL cholesterol, increase levels of heart-protective HDL cholesterol, and reduce blood pressure, all of which may help prevent heart disease. 
  A 2021 study that included data on 92,978 Americans found that those who more than a ½ tablespoon serving of olive oil per day had a 14% lower risk of heart disease compared to people who didn’t consume olive oil.
  One of the main reasons why olive oil consumption is associated with reduced disease risk is because it’s concentrated in compounds that help reduce inflammation and protect against cellular damage. 
  Olive oil contains more than 200 plant compounds, including carotenoids, sterols, and polyphenols like hydroxytyrosol (HT) and hydroxytyrosol acetate (HT-ac), which act as powerful antioxidants in the body.
  These compounds inhibit inflammatory pathways in the body and may help reduce markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). 
  A 2015 review of 30 studies that included 3,106 participants found that supplementation with olive oil in doses ranging from 1 milligrams (mg) to 50 mg per day led to significant reductions in CRP and IL-6 compared to control treatments.
  Because olive oil is so high in anti-inflammatory substances, it may benefit those with inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A 2023 study that included 365 people living with RA found that higher consumption of olive oil was associated with a significant favorable effect on RA disease activity and lower levels of inflammatory markers like CRP.
  Including more olive oil in your diet may help lower your risk of common diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and may help you live a longer, healthier life.
  A 2017 review of four cohort studies and 29 randomized control trials found that people in the highest olive oil intake category had a 16% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to people in the lowest intake category. Additionally, the review found that olive oil supplementation improved markers of long-term blood sugar control and fasting blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes compared with control groups, meaning that olive oil can be effective for preventing type 2 diabetes and improving health outcomes in people with existing diabetes.
  Similarly, 2022 review found that each additional 25-gram serving per day of olive oil was associated with a significant 22% reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes. The review also found that olive oil consumption lowered the risk of death from all causes.
  Additionally, a 2022 study that included data on 92,383 Americans found that the participants who consumed the most olive oil had a 17% lower risk of cancer-related mortality, a 29% lower risk of neurodegenerative disease-related mortality, and an 18% lower risk of respiratory disease-related mortality.
  The researchers concluded that replacing ten grams per day of fats like butter, mayonnaise, and margarine with the same amount of olive oil was associated with an 8%-34% lower risk of death from all causes.
  Olive oil is a healthy fat that’s rich in vitamin E, a nutrient that functions as a powerful antioxidant in the body. Most of the fat in olive oil is unsaturated, making it a smart choice for heart health. 
  Here’s the nutrition breakdown for a one-tablespoon serving of olive oil.
  Olive oil is mainly composed of monounsaturated fat and is low in saturated fat. The monounsaturated fats in olive oil, especially oleic acid, are beneficial for heart health. 
  Study findings suggest that replacing sources of saturated fats, like butter, with monounsaturated fats, like olive oil, could help reduce the risk of heart disease.
  Olive oil is also a good source of vitamin E, a nutrient that plays an important role in immune function and protects cells against oxidative damage that may otherwise lead to disease. 
  Most people in the U.S. don’t consume enough vitamin E-rich foods. Some evidence suggests that around 96% of women and 90% of men in the U.S. have insufficient vitamin E intake, which could negatively impact overall health.
  Fortunately, including more olive oil in your diet is an easy way to boost your intake of this essential nutrient. 
  Olive oil is considered a healthy fat and is safe to consume for most people. However, people who are allergic to olives should avoid all olive-derived products, including olive oil.
  Also, like all fats, olive oil is calorie-dense. Just one tablespoon contains 126 calories and 14 grams of fat. That said, high-calorie, high-fat foods, like olive oil, nuts, and avocados, can be enjoyed regularly as part of a well-rounded nutritious diet.
  However, people who are trying to lose weight may want to cut back on their portions of high-calorie ingredients, like oils, in order to create a calorie deficit to promote fat loss. 
  Olive oil can be added to a number of sweet and savory recipes and is appropriate for low-to-moderate-heat cooking methods, like sauteeing and baking. 
  Keep in mind that virgin olive oils, including extra virgin olive oils, have a lower smoke point than refined olive oils. Smoke point refers to the temperature at which an oil begins to smoke. The smoke point of extra virgin olive oil lies between 350-410⁰ F, while the smoke point of refined olive oil can range from 390-470⁰ F, making refined olive oil a better choice for higher-heat cooking.
  Here are some easy ways to incorporate more olive oil into your diet:
  There are many other ways to use olive oil in your kitchen, so don’t be afraid to experiment with this versatile fat. 
  Try replacing different fats, like butter and vegetable oil, with olive oil in your favorite recipes, and keep high-quality olive oil in your pantry so you always have a healthy fat option to prepare delicious meals. 
  Olive oil is considered one of the healthiest oils you can eat. This heart-healthy fat is packed with protective plant compounds that may help reduce inflammation and protect against cellular damage. 
  Diets high in olive oil have been linked to a number of health benefits, including lowering the risk of common health conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Plus, olive oil is versatile and can be used in both sweet and savory recipes.
  Consider stocking your kitchen with this multipurpose fat for an easy way to better your health.
