CLARKSVILLE, TN (CLARKSVILLE NOW) – Thanks to local businesses and community supporters, students at Byrns Darden Elementary School have new basketball court for kids to play on.
Jaime Mobley, physical education teacher at the school, said this was something she had been trying to get for the school for many years. Mobley said the school had received funds to purchase the basketball goal and reached out to Expert Concrete for an estimate on a concrete pad. They ended up covering the cost, which would have been several thousand dollars.

Expert Concrete Owner Christopher Foster said his company was improving the community and giving kids a place to play outside. “Look at the things they have nice here, at the end of the day for the kids that want to be athletic,” Foster said.
Foster added it is a half-court basketball court for elementary school kids and will provide decades of use.
“They’re giving us a 40 foot by 40 foot concrete pad, which isn’t quite a full basketball court, but it’s a good size, we’re saving a lot of money, and we’re excited to have that donation,” Mobley said.
Mobley said local businesses who donated for the project include Expert Concrete, Clarksville Mobile Mix, Phoenix Trucking, United Rentals, Wicked Colors and Epoxy Depot.
“This means more physical activity for the kids. We have a huge playground and only a portion of the playground is taken up by equipment. It was a perfect place for it, and it gives them more opportunities to be active,” Mobley said. The basketball court is also handicapped accessible.
