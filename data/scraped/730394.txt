 If one hack that controls amputated cockroach legs this week wasn’t enough for you, we’ve got another. Earlier this week we saw two neuroscientists at Backyard Brains put on a show at a TED talk by connecting an amputated cockroach leg (don’t worry, they grow back) to a $100 electronic device called the SpikerBox. The SpikerBox allows students to explore the world of axons and action potentials by listening in on the electronic signals generated by the hair on the legs of a cockroach. For the finale for their TED talk, the SpikerBox guys attached an MP3 player to the cockroach leg, causing the now dead appendage to dance a little jig. This new build – the Salt Shaker from Thinker Thing again allows students to amputate cockroach legs, pin them down with electrodes, and cause muscle contractions with the sound of science. Thinker Thing took this one step further than the neuroscientists at Backyard Brains; now you can control a cockroach leg with your mind. The folks at Thinker Thing are using an off the shelf EEG system from Emotiv to capture the alpha, beta, and delta brainwaves of their new human test subjects. By interpreting these brain signals, they can convert these small variations in cerebral electrical activity to sound files. From there, it’s simply a matter of plugging in the Salt Shaker and moving a cockroach leg with your mind. In the video after the break you can check out the folks at Thinker Thing playing around with their Salt Shaker and controlling a cockroach leg with a team member’s mind.  [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UlkPZKPVLE&w=470] I’ve been controlling cockroach legs with my mind for some months now. But then, I am a cockroach. LOL I can control giant ants. Ant Agonizer :P science nowadays has grown, so much… i guess this might help to shape the future… B.b.buuuhRAINS!!! Best put a diode in there in case the coackroach takes over your mind :| Ok, next, hook it up to a quadriplegic. So, rip a limb off of one and make it twitch? I like the way you think. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18749963 I always hate the misleading connotations of saying “Controlled with your mind.” It’s not actually controlled in any meaningful way, just random brain activity transferred into nonrelevant noise. i get what you mean but its a first step… how bout this tho? http://www.ted.com/talks/miguel_nicolelis_a_monkey_that_controls_a_robot_with_its_thoughts_no_really.html the mind grows a new virtual limb after training with it long enough. if there were a standardized control scheme you could plug and play with different limbs, live or robotic.
