 Wanted: Dead, a new character action game from developer Soleil, stars a Hannah Stone, a cyborg cop working in Hong Kong. But you might not know that from the game’s new music video. Instead, the video traces the backstory of a different character named Cinammon, who works at a diner frequented by Stone and her unit. Check out the video below. Set to Donna Summers’ “She Works Hard for the Money,” the Wanted: Dead music video establishes the atmosphere of the game’s grungy, yet futuristic setting. Hannah Stone also shows up during the vid to order seemingly every item off the menu. Cinnamon’s job doesn’t end with her shift at the diner, though. With side gigs at a bar, and a cabaret, her days and evenings are full even before she takes some time to care for her kids. That being said, it doesn’t say too much about the game itself. A more substantial look at what players will actually encounter can be found in the Wanted: Dead pre-order trailer uploaded last week. The pre-order trailer, which features much more of Hannah Stone’s activities, does include a few in-game looks at Cinnamon and her diner. Created by developers with experience working on the likes of Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry, Wanted: Dead blends melee slashing and third-person shooting. Anime cutscenes and minigames round out a look at life in Soleil’s stylized vision of future Hong Kong, where even cops work outside the law. Wanted: Dead will release on PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S PS5, and PC on February 14, 2023.
