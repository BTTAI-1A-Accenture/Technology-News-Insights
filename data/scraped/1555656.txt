 “We all should know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry, and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value no matter what their color.” — Maya Angelou  The key factor of success for Nobel’s journey of over 25 years is the team and the constant teamwork and innovation guided by our 5 core values which impact the customers, team members, partners, family members, friends of family members and the entire world. At Nobel, we bring in this innovation and valuable teamwork through team members with many different life experiences, perspectives and ways of thinking. Just as innovation is an ongoing process, so is our Colors of Nobel – Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program. Our team members continue to embrace their role in DE&I, finding new ways to make Nobel more diverse and inclusive internally, as well as enhancing our products to make the world more accessible for all. Our mission can only be achieved when we represent and include everyone we seek to empower. Diversity and inclusion is more than policies, programs, or headcounts. Equitable employers outpace their competitors by respecting the unique needs, perspectives and potential of all their team members. As a result, diverse and inclusive workplaces earn deeper trust and more commitment from their team members. A diverse and inclusive environment establishes a sense of belonging among team members. When our team members feel more connected at work, they tend to work harder and smarter, producing higher quality work. As a result, organizations that adopt DE&I practices see huge gains in the form of business results, innovation, and decision-making.  At Nobel, we are a winning team. We are diverse, we grow together, we act and communicate with respect and integrity! Guided by teamwork and innovation, the work of diversity, equity and inclusion is about having intention in all we do. It is about leveraging our global influence to drive positive change within our company and across the communities where we live and work. It is about creating together and investing in team members’ experiences, access to opportunity, and futures. It relies on harnessing key insights that help us yield business outcomes, people outcomes, and culture outcomes. In many ways, inclusion is teamwork and innovation: It is about envisioning, designing, and constantly developing an organization and an industry that are more and more globally diverse. This year we put together all the internal activities and numbers to show that we are increasing representation and strengthening a culture of inclusion at Nobel. We are motivated about the fact that our continued progress feels particularly meaningful in the context of significant challenges around the world. We continue to have an open and transparent communication. Doing this allows us to reinforce our highly collaborative growth mindset culture, live our values, and create the conditions for every team member to bring their authentic selves to work. From recruiting new team members to orientation and onboarding, benefits and compensation, team members communities and events, career development, and more - we build a sustainable environment that enable us to deliver on our promises of an inclusive experience for our team members and customers. It’s also a performance and development core priority for every team member to accelerate inclusion through intentional everyday actions. Teamwork is not possible without having trust both on personal and professional levels and honest and open communication. Listening to team members’ feedback is essential. We do this through the annual stay interview process and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion company-wide survey run twice a year, focused more on the team members’ experience, going beyond measuring engagement to gauge whether employees are thriving. On our employee survey question about whether people strongly feel included in their teams and the question about whether Nobel provides an environment for free and open expression of ideas, opinions and beliefs, the item scored an average of 86% globally. As a company of more than 250 employees who work in over 25 countries across our broader Nobel business, we face a formidable challenge in making diversity and inclusion meaningful and actionable for everyone. To meet this challenge, we design company-wide, globally relevant ways for employees to engage with the work, while also ensuring conversations and actions are meaningful at a local level.  https://nobelcareers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Nobel_Diversity_Equity_and_Inclusion_Report_2022.pdf
