GREENVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA: Jimmy ‘MrBeast’ recently held a $200,000 Twitter giveaway in which he gave his followers a link that gave them access to around $5 worth of Shop Cash to spend in the in-app store of the Shop app. The well-known YouTuber is known for hosting exorbitant giveaways, so his American fans were overjoyed to get the complimentary present.  For a while now, MrBeast has produced content centered on giving away expensive goods and incredible sums of money, earning the nickname "the giveaway king" from many. He not only established himself as the most popular YouTube producer but he also launched a number of companies, including the Beast Burgers fast food restaurant chain and Feastables, a line of chocolate bars. As MrBeast instructed his followers to purchase any with the coupon in his tweet, “I’m giving away $200k Shop Cash in the @shop app – get it while you can and pls spend some on feastables,” and it appears that the Shop Cash promotion was driven to market his brand Feastables on the app.  I’m giving away $200k Shop Cash in the @shop app – get it while you can and pls spend some on feastables :-) #shopifypartner https://t.co/Yy7DRCbwpf   The three-time winner of the Content Creator of the Year award has over 150 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, making him one of the most well-known YouTube stars worldwide. His YouTube empire, however, extends much beyond, with additional channels devoted to gaming, charity, and non-English language dub challenges, which have recently seen tremendous popularity.  Naturally, the pool was depleted within minutes after MrBeast announced his initial offer of $200,000 in Shop Cash, thanks to admirers from all across the US claiming it. It got so bad that the giveaway's total amount had to be raised to $500,000 by the content creator, who added $300,000 to the originally promised amount. In response to the initial statement, he tweeted, “It went so fast we just added another $300,000! Enjoy the $.”
