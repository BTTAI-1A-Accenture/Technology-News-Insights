U.S. Rep. Scott Franklin, R-Lakeland, has introduced the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act, along with Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia.

AEDs are used to assist victims of sudden cardiac arrests and increase the survival rate. Use of the devices is limited because of conflicting state laws that discourage their use through the threat of lawsuits, the release said. Rep. Darren Soto, D-Kissimmee, is a co-sponsor of the bill.
