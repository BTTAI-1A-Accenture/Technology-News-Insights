Funded by a grant from the Tommy Thompson Center on Public Leadership, the project seeks to give residents a voice about how technology might be useful in closing service gaps in areas such as transportation, health and communication. Professors Mita Banerjee and John Ward, along with a team of eight students, developed and implemented the survey, and will use mapping technology to display and analyze information about the communities.
