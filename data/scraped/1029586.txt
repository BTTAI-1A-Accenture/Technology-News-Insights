A rough estimate of the amount you need is about 18g a day, though 16 - 24g is a healthy range and individual requirements vary.  Ideally you should aim to open your bowels at least once a day and not have to strain when you go to the loo. One example of what you'd need to equal about 18g is a bowl of bran cereal for breakfast, a wholemeal sandwich with a bowl of salad for lunch, and five portions of fruit and vegetables. You need to eat a balance of insoluble an soluble fibre types.  Insoluble fibre is the type that's best at alleviating constipation as it can soak up around fifteen times it's own weight in water.  This increases the bulk of stools, which in turn stimulates gut contractions and keeps the bowels moving regularly.  Foods richest in insoluble fibre are the fibrous types like wholemeal bread, brown rice and bran cereals. Soluble fibre helps food move along the gut too, but it also lowers cholesterol by binding to it in the gut. It doesn't hold as much water as insoluble fibre, but it dissolves in the gut forming a viscous gel.  This gel slows down the rate at which sugar enters the bloodstream, which can help keep energy levels steady. Too much soluble fibre can sometimes be a problem though, as it is fermented by bacteria to produce gas.  If you are prone to wind or an irritable bowel, eat your five a day fruit and vegetables - but no more - and avoid beans and pulses.
