BYD founder and chairman Wang Chuanfu has pledged that his company will not only grow market share outside mainland China but also crack into the top tier of carmakers worldwide, commanding the same recognition and esteem as global household names. “Wang has sent a loud message to global marquees and customers that BYD is coming up as a new powerful EV company, which is able to compete against any established international auto brand in any international market,” said David Zhang, a visiting professor at Huanghe Science and Technology College. Now, Wang and his peers have to follow through on the global stage. “It is of vital importance for BYD and other Chinese carmakers to generate a big number of sales outside China if they are determined in their resolve to become global players,” Zhang said. Founded by Wang in 1995 as a battery producer, BYD has been making vehicles since 2003 after it bought the licence of Xi’an Tsinchuan Auto from the Shaanxi provincial government and the defence contractor China Ordnance Industries Group. When he recalled the carmaker’s 20-year history of developing EVs, Wang appeared on the verge of tears, insisting that his resolution to spend heavily on research and development held the key to BYD’s success. “We are now powerful enough to lead the transition of the global auto industry,” he said. “China can add vigour to the industry’s electrification drive.” BYD began aggressively tapping markets outside China last year with plans to either sell its Chinese-made cars or set up local assemblies to produce cars for international markets. The company is also constructing an assembly plant in Uzbekistan. BYD’s blade lithium iron phosphate battery packs have been well received by Chinese drivers and car assemblers. The battery cells are arranged in a manner that increases energy density while enhancing resistance to overheating. The blade batteries have also been supplied to Tesla’s factory in Berlin.
