 This year kicked off with the announcement of an anime adaptation for Eku Takashima’s yuri manga Whisper Me a Love Song, and now we have more information. In addition to a new teaser visual and additions to the cast, the official accounts revealed that the series will premiere in Japan in January 2024. The latest cast additions include Mikako Komatsu as Aki Mizuguchi, Konomi Kohara as Mari Tsutsui, Ai Kakuma as Kaori Tachibana and Yuna Nemoto as Shiho Izumi.  Here’s the new visual:  The Whisper Me a Love Song TV anime is currently in the works at CLOUDHEARTS (The Iceblade Sorcerer Shall Rule the World), with Xinya Cai (assistant director on The Genius Prince’s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt) directing and Hiroki Uchida (Requiem of the Rose King) on series composition. Other staff members announced thus far include character designer Minami Yoshida (chief animation director on Princess Connect! Re:Dive), and the main cast features Hana Shimano making her debut as Himari Kino alongside Asami Seto (Mai in Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai) as Yori Asanagi. Kodansha USA publishes the series in English and describes it: Bubbly, energetic first-year high school student Himari falls head over heels for her senpai Yori after hearing her band perform on the first day of school. Himari tells Yori she just loves her, and, to Himari’s surprise, Yori says she loves Himari back! But when Himari realizes that she and her senpai are feeling two different kinds of love, she begins to ask herself what “love” really means… Via Comic Natalie Newsletter Subscribe to our mailing list to get the latest news to your email inbox • Lists and Rankings
