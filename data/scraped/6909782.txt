  Drivers and Restraints:  
  Increasing Incorporation in Bakery and Confectionery Items to Bolster Growth  
Consumers nowadays are inclining rapidly towards plant-based products as they are considered to be healthier and safer, compared to animal-originated products. The Vegan Society, for instance, declared that in Europe, the U.K. is showcasing an exponential growth in its plant-based milk sector. In 2019, it stood at USD 320.6 million in the overall European market. At the same time, several people are practicing vegan diets worldwide. This is encouraging numerous companies to incorporate plant-based milk in a wide range of confectionery and bakery items. In February 2021, the Scottish Government announced that it would soon include plant-based milk alternatives on a government-funded early learning milk scheme and nursery. Additionally, the surging prevalence of lactose intolerance has compelled people to opt for coconut milk.
However, coconut farming depends mainly on climatic conditions. As the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing, the global climatic conditions are also changing at a fast pace. Therefore, the frequent harsh weather conditions may hamper the coconut milk market growth in the near future.
