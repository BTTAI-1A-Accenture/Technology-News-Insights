The ban on women serving in the Army's frontline units was lifted in 2018. However, there are still no women in the Special Air Service or Special Boat Service Special Air Service top brass want female troops to join the Army’s elite regiment. They believe women will add a new dimension to the fighting force with the motto “Who Dares Wins”. One in ten of the armed forces are women but there are none in the SAS or its sister regiment the Special Boat Service. In an unofficial recruitment drive, the regiment has visited the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Berks, and the Infantry Battle School in Wales.
