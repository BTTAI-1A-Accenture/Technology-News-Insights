                         There are various forms of healing that have been portrayed in various medical anime series. However, the anime series Healer Girl takes healing a step further by introducing the art of vocal medicine. Vocal medicine allows one to heal others using the power of their voice. These songs can be used to treat a wide variety of conditions as long as the right knowledge is joined with the right technical skills.
     If anyone is looking for medical attention, it’s probably best to avoid these terrible anime healers.                     As Healer Girl shows a unique form in which medicine is applied, it resonates with a lot of fans as it offers something unique. While vocal/sound healing offers a limited application in the real world, a whole field called Psychoacoustics exists, and Healer Girl portrays some of the things that go on there.
