Bandai Namco has updated its City Shrouded in Shadow “Granzella“ teaser website launched last week with a seven-day countdown.  The website, pictured above, has since zoomed out its starting state to reveal its original fantasy picture is only an image on a city building screen. The side of the image now features the text “Giant Shadow Newsflash,” and the bottom features the scrolling text, “A huge shadow has appeared on the outskirts of the city. It’s moving towards the central part of town. As a a result, transportation facilities are interrupted.” Seven days from now is September 17—the start of the Tokyo Game Show.
