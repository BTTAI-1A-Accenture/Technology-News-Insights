 Developers and organizations using Microsoft’s Bing Search API are in for bad news, with the tech giant announcing massive price hikes. Scheduled to be in effect from May 1, 2023, the price hike will see Bing Search API prices rising nine times across all markets. Much like Twitter, Microsoft will be hiking the prices at significantly varying rates across different pricing tiers, ranging from 257% to 900%. The free instance, however, will continue to offer 1,000 free transactions a month as it currently does. Microsoft has cited its technological investments to improve Bing Search as the reason behind the steep price hike. The tech giant recently invested $10 million in OpenAI and has been integrating the latter’s products into its own. These include ChatGPT – OpenAI’s advanced language model that has entered the limelight in recent weeks. Bing Search is one of the first Microsoft products to integrate the new AI products, and Microsoft Office and Edge are to follow the suite. Though far behind Google Search in popularity, Microsoft Bing recently made the headlines for testing AI additions to their products across 160 countries. Microsoft charges for the Bing Search APIs based on the number of API calls, known as transactions. The plans work on a pay-as-you-go basis. Once the specified limit is reached, Bing automatically throttles the usage to keep it within the limit. Of course, users can get their plans upgraded to a higher tier whenever they need. Instance S1 is currently priced at $7 per 1000 transactions and will rise to $25 for the same number of transactions after the hike. The Bing Statistics Add-in transactions will grow 10 times as expensive, from $1 to $10 per thousand transactions. The API pricing with large language models (like ChatGPT) currently starts at $28 per thousand transactions for less than a million daily requests. With the price hike, this will be skyrocketing to $200 per 1000 transactions for more than a million requests a day. The sudden and steep price hike puts developers and organizations using the Bing Search API in a tough spot. Third-party search engines like DuckDuckGo that don’t have their own crawlers and rely on the Bing Search API to pull data may be impacted heavily. However, there’s a chance that such large companies may work out custom agreements with Microsoft. Those unable to support the new costs may be forced to switch to a different search API, which is a bit inconvenient considering it’ll cause the search results to change. Microsoft’s announcement comes not too long after Twitter announced it’ll start charging for the platform’s API, which has been free to use so far.
