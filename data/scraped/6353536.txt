“India believes in democratised access to all digital health solutions, promoting a culture of Global Public Goods,” Mandaviya said as he stated that the event will explore the transformative potential of digital health and innovations that can help achieve universal health coverage.
Giving several examples of digital interventions that were used for the benefit of citizens, Mandaviya noted how data-driven insights were leveraged to guide COVID-19 management in the country and simultaneously enabled healthcare service delivery through digital means during the pandemic.
Similarly, he noted how the largest government-funded health insurance scheme in the world, PM-JAY was providing secondary and tertiary care services to 500 million Indian citizens in a paperless and cashless manner.


Pawar noted India’s journey to becoming a digitally empowered nation and the need for digital health ecosystems for patient-centric healthcare services. She highlighted India’s collaboration with WHO to achieve the objectives envisioned under Global Strategy on Digital Health and its work towards promoting Digital Public Goods with specific focus on Global South.
