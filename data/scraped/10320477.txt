 To determine the best real estate website builder, Forbes Advisor explored a number of factors, such as price, ease of use, integrations and customer service. We also considered each company’s reputation, reviews from real users and analysis by our own experts. Since most real estate entrepreneurs and small business owners aren’t coders, ease of use was of utmost importance. Website builders that made it easy to build a website through a drag-and-drop interface, for example, received higher rankings than those that required some knowledge of HTML. We prioritized price and looked for options that were either ideal for real estate startups or those with limited funds or offered robust paid plans for more established businesses with no shortage of add-ons and perks. Those providers that offered a money-back guarantee also fared well in our ratings. Pricing accounted for 10% of our weighted scoring. Since integrations are essential for being able to add an appointment scheduler and other conversion-oriented features, those also played a vital role in our rankings. Offering features like unlimited bandwidth and storage, being able to build mobile-responsive websites, offering marketing tools for email and social media and the aforementioned drag-and-drop functionality also allowed a website to score better in our reviews. We weighted features at 40% of our total score. Customer support, especially if it’s available 24/7 and at no additional cost, is a feature many real estate firms and agents ― as well as others creating their own websites ― look for in a provider. Those who provided customer support and did it well fared better in our rankings. This information came by turning to popular third-party review websites G2 and Trustpilot to get reactions from real users of the platforms. We only chose website builders with positive reputations and plenty of raving reviews from current and former customers. These accounted for 20% of the total score. Looking at factors like ease of use, popularity, stand-out features and value for the price, our panel of experts came up with a final analysis of each website builder based on all of the criteria listed above. Altogether, this final section accounted for 30% of the total score. Most real estate website builders were designed with beginners in mind. This means you can use them to create a website, even if you have minimal to no experience with coding and design. When you’re launching your real estate venture, a free plan might make sense. But if you’re looking to scale in the near future or you consider yourself a larger business with years of experience under your belt, a paid plan can do wonders for your online presence. Before you choose a real estate website builder, think about the stage of your business, your budget and your goals. If you’re a solo real estate agent who hopes to build your brand through great content, Blogger or Wix might be a good fit. WordPress is likely a better option if you’re more experienced and don’t mind spending some money on your site. Because most website builders offer cutting-edge technology, they are usually ahead of the curve when it comes to keeping their sites secure. They do this by keeping their customers’ websites protected by using top-end technology. Because of this, most website building companies offer some of the best security options available on the internet.
