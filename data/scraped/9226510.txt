 Arc System Works will release a Bridget outfit for you to put on your VRChat avatar. The release date is October 6, 2023. It will also re-run the May outfit. As a note, the avatar does not actually turn you into Bridget or May. Instead, theyâ€™re costumes that you can place on an existing one. [Thanks, Famitsu!] The Guilty Gear Strive Bridget outfit in VRChat will cost 3000 JPY. You can place it on Moe, Manuka, Kikyo, or Selestia. While the May outfit already came out, an updated version of it will be released on October 6, 2023. The May outfit will cost 2000 JPY, and will now include her weapon and glove. Merino and Kikyo can wear her outfit. Though not Guilty Gear Strive, there are also avatar costumes you can get of characters from Guilty Gear Xrd. There are outfits of Elphelt, Dizzy, Baiken, and Jam. All of these outfits are for the Kikyo avatar. Since her addition to the playable roster of Guilty Gear Strive, Bridget has been a popular character for marketing purposes. T-Shirts with her on them appeared at TGS 2023, and you can get a figure of her or a plush of her teddy bear Roger. This is likely due to her design, as well as the enduring popularity of her character from previous Guilty Gear titles. Guilty Gear Strive is readily available on the PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, and Windows PC. The Guilty Gear Strive Bridget and May Version 2.0 outfits for you to use on your VRChat avatar will cmoe out on October 6, 2023.
