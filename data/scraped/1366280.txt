It may have taken longer than expected, but Best Buy has finally launched their new My Best Buy memberships.

If you shop at Best Buy often, it's a must-have to earn exclusive savings and deals that you'd otherwise miss out on.
                         To celebrate, Best Buy has kicked off a member exclusive sale this weekend that features tons of additional and exclusive savings on hundreds of items that can only be obtained if you've got a My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total membership.
