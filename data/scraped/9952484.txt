The latest breaking updates, delivered straight to your email inbox. A major theme park and water park will soon go cashless.  SeaWorld Orlando and Aquatica will make the switch on Wednesday, Aug. 30. In a post on its website, SeaWorld says they believe going cashless is faster and more secure. The post also states it's a simple, efficient and flexible way of enjoying their parks. This means guests will have to swipe or tap their credit or debit card at restaurants, stores, ticket windows and parking. Guests can also use Apple Pay and Google Pay. SeaWorld set up kiosks for guests who still bring cash. They will transfer up to $500 onto a Visa prepaid debit card for free.  Guests with money left over can still use their card wherever Visa is accepted. The change also applies to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and Adventure Island. Click here to learn more.
