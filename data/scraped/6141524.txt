 The country’s first fire and rescue village for children formally opens in Bacoor City, Cavite.  According to Ian Cruz’s report on “24 Oras” on Tuesday, the P4-million Fire and Security Rescue Village project was created to teach the youth and the residents what to do in case of fire incidents, which were inspired by the fire-prevention practices in South Korea and Japan.  “This beautiful project stands proudly ready to teach not just the children of Bacoor but every Filipino because that is exactly what we need right now -- an empowered citizenry,”  Fire and Security Rescue Village Chief Inspector Alma Gardose said.  Among the lessons taught in the village are how to prevent fire, what to do during fire emergencies, and how to properly evacuate during fire incidents.  “Tinuturuan ang mga bata ano ang gagawin in the first five minutes at kumpletuhin nila sila sa taas andun din how to resuscitate first aid yung paghinga yung mga...kasi tandaan nyo ang pumapatay din yung usok,” Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos said.  (Kids are being taught what to do in the first five minutes of the fire and how to resuscitate and give first aid. Remember that smoke also accounts for fire-related deaths.)  Apart from the fire practices, children are likewise taught the proper things to do during earthquakes. —Sundy Locus/ VAL, GMA Integrated News
