Bruce Wemple loves sci-fi, which is apparent once you take even just a quick glance at his filmography. Just this year, he also directed The Tomorrow Job (released by Dread Central’s parent company Epic Pictures) and now, he’s diving into sci-fi horror with Island Escape, a Dread release. But there’s a similarity throughout much of his work: Wemple loves messing with the concept of time. We spoke with Wemple over Zoom to discuss that very love, especially as it pertains to Island Escape. After a mysterious accident at a research camp on the Isle of Gran Manan, a CEO hires a team of blue-collar mercenaries to extract his daughter, a scientist working at the camp. Upon arrival, the team soon learns that not only is the island surrounded by a wormhole that causes time to reset every three days, but it’s also crawling with hideous monsters. As they learn more about the nature of time, space, and the creatures on the island, they quickly realize that death may be the easiest way to escape the island. During our time with Wemple, we also discussed his love of sci-fi, his unintentional cryptid trilogy, and the delicate balance of explaining lore in genre films. Island Escape is out now on VOD.
