CEO and founder at Smart Energy Water. Connecting people with energy and water providers.   The utility sector is undergoing a revolution, and the transformation is nothing short of remarkable. Utilities are leading the way toward achieving a sustainable world with the incorporation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, smart grid infrastructure implementation, e-mobility adoption advancement and deployment of advanced technologies such as energy storage systems. From what I have observed, the next frontier in the digital transformation journey for the industry is something I like to call the “X Factor.” This entails that it is crucial to recognize the importance of workforce experience (WX) and invest in modern technology to build a successful transformation that improves the connected customer-workforce experience. Along with this, it is essential to create a connected ecosystem where customers, field workers and technology seamlessly integrate to drive innovation and success.  Field workers can now be equipped with the latest mobile apps, wearables and other technological solutions, enabling them to communicate with their team and customers in real time. No more frustrating delays or miscommunication—just quick updates and efficient task completion. And with data analytics and AI-ML, utility providers can optimize their operations for cost savings and better outcomes. The result can lead to faster response times, enhanced productivity and an overall improved customer experience. So if you’re in the field services industry and looking to embrace the power of WX, here are some important things to know. The foundation of the utility transformation is the connected experience. It starts with everyday use cases such as developing mobile apps for bill payments and outage management, expanding customer-facing platforms to encompass smart homes, and e-mobility, providing round-the-clock engagement with utility service agents and integrating customer and field worker journeys for seamless service delivery. Here’s a look at some of the next-gen connected use cases. Leveraging AI-ML algorithms and historical data can help proactively anticipate potential equipment failures, optimize maintenance schedules and proactively dispatch field technicians. This can help utilities reduce downtime, increase productivity and save costs by avoiding unexpected equipment failures and minimizing the need for reactive maintenance. Automating manual and paper-based processes and streamlining workflows, reducing the need for manual inspections and enabling proactive maintenance can help improve operational efficiency, reduce human errors and increase safety by minimizing the need for manual intervention in critical processes. This enables remote diagnostics and troubleshooting by allowing field technicians to work from anywhere and access critical data in real time. Remote technology helps utilities reduce service time and costs, improves customer satisfaction and increases workforce productivity by quickly and efficiently resolving issues without needing on-site visits. Mixed reality provides field workers with hands-free, immersive experiences using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to diagnose and repair issues faster and more accurately, allowing them to collaborate with remote experts in real time. It enables utilities to improve safety, reduce downtime and facilitate remote collaboration with experts. Using geographic information system (GIS) technology to track and analyze workforce data can help make informed decisions in real time and optimize resource allocation and task prioritization. It empowers utilities to quickly identify and respond to potential outages or hazards, reducing downtime and improving customer satisfaction. Demand forecasting helps anticipate and plan for future service demands and optimizes the utility workforce by scheduling the field workers and equipment more efficiently. It can minimize costs and maximize revenue by ensuring that resources are allocated cost-effectively and profitably. This empowers field workers with access to real-time data, work orders and customer information on their mobile devices, enabling them to complete tasks efficiently, providing them tools to build enterprise-wide collaboration and delivering better customer service. For utilities, incorporating digital platforms into field service operations and workforce management can help overcome barriers and create a seamless experience for all stakeholders. By following a connected approach, utilities can ensure that customers, field workers and service agents reap the benefits of improved efficiency and productivity. Here's a look at some actionable steps utilities can take to ensure they are prepared for field workforce experience. To prepare for the field workforce experience, utilities must understand field workers' specific needs and requirements. By prioritizing the features and functionalities of the native mobile application, they can cater to the unique workflows of their field workers. Establishing specific objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) aligns efforts and tracks progress. For instance, utilities can aim to improve response time by 20% within six months, fostering accountability and driving continuous improvement. Implementing effective change management strategies is crucial for smooth transitions and overcoming resistance. Utilities must provide comprehensive training and support to encourage the adoption of new technologies and processes, while open communication and stakeholder involvement promote acceptance and engagement. Field workers should have access to comprehensive information and resources through the platform. Utilities empower field workers to resolve issues effectively and make informed decisions on-site by ensuring relevant information is readily available. Incorporating offline capabilities into the platform is essential, as field workers often operate in areas with limited or no network connectivity. Critical features, data and resources should be accessible even when offline, ensuring uninterrupted productivity. Collaborating with industry peers fosters continuous improvement and keeps utilities abreast of industry trends. Sharing experiences, insights and lessons learned promotes innovation and enables utilities to adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities. To ensure successful field workforce management, it's essential to have a cohesive approach that marries the right platform with intent. WX is critical in this regard, especially as the energy ecosystem evolves. However, the question remains: Do utilities have the right platforms in place? When searching for a field workforce experience platform, utility companies should prioritize security measures, cloud-based implementation for accessibility, flexibility to adapt to changing needs, scalability to accommodate growth and a user-friendly application for seamless adoption.
