Want the best deal in GOLF? This collection won't be around for long. Grab your limited edition gear while it's still available.  COURTESY Two brands sharing the pursuit to innovate the game, Miura and Greyson have teamed up to bring us a sleek and stylish limited-edition apparel collaboration. It’s great seeing the wolf (Greyson) and the samurai (Miura) joining forces.  In this capsule release, these pieces evoke the spirit of the wolf and samurai in absolute style.  We’re 100% here for it, especially the Cokato Hoodie, which I’d be willing to bet will be one of the first pieces to sell out.  Another personal favorite has to be the ‘Walk of the Samurai Polo’ which (adorably) is available in men’s, women’s and kid’s sizes and silhouettes. Scroll to the end to see the polo you can match with your whole family.  And if you’d like to check out the Miura x Greyson stamped MB-101 and TB-901 irons, check out those here.  It’s so lovely when brands release matching family sets, and we love seeing parents and kids matching on the golf course! There’s just something about seeing the same print on a tinier polo that we can’t get enough of. Take any and all opportunities you get to match your kid on the course… because well, they just grow up too fast. Marley Sims is GOLF Magazine and Golf.com’s Associate Manager of Commerce.
