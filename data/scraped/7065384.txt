The last platform we visited was a popular one in the United States, but this one here might even reign supreme. FanDuel Sportsbook is touted as America’s #1 sportsbook and for good reason, including having one of the best NCAAB sportsbook promos. Their No Sweat First Bet offer for new members of up to $1,000 is just another reason why. After registering here, your first bet with FanDuel will be 100% insured by bonus bets. This means that should your first wager on their platform lose, you won’t even have to worry. The bet insurance will be triggered, and your account will be credited with the same amount you wagered in bonus bets up to $1,000. All it takes is an initial deposit of at least $10 and you can then place a wager between $10 and $1,000. Again, there’s no FanDuel promo code required to claim this offer as long as you click here to create your account. Must be 21+. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER.

Once you’ve set up an account using Caesars promo code FULLSYR at registration, you’ll earn a double-gifted sign-up bonus. To start, $1,250 worth of bet insurance will be applied to your first wager on the platform. But as mentioned, it doesn’t end there. You’ll also receive 1,000 Tier Credits and 1,000 Caesars Reward Credits® just for creating an account. So why wouldn’t you want to take advantage of this spectacular deal?

After using this link to get your account started, your first fixed odds wager of the day for five consecutive days will be fully insured by Second Chance bets up to $50 each. That means that this deal has a total value of $250. If you create an account on a Sunday for example, you’ll be able to place your first fixed odds wager of each successive day up to and including Thursday worry-free knowing they’re backed by Second Chance bets. If any of these wagers happen to lose, that’s when you’ll be gifted your bonus funds worth up to $50 a piece. There’s no minimum deposit requirement and no need to enter a promo code, either.

Another one of the best NCAAB sportsbook promos is our final bet-insurance related welcome offer that we’ll be detailing today, and this one comes from BetMGM Sportsbook. They’re being extremely generous themselves by dishing out $1,000 worth of bet insurance to new members who click here to create an account. Just make an initial $10+ deposit and place a $10-$1,000 wager on any available market. If it loses, you’ll receive bonus bets equal to the amount you wagered. If your qualifying wager is less than $50, it will be credited as a single bonus bet should it lose. But if your qualifying wager is more than $50, it will be credited as five individual bonus bets upon losing. For instance, a $1,000 losing first wager would see you credited with five $200 bonus bets. Sticking with the theme of not needing a promo code, there isn’t one necessary to claim this offer either as long as you sign up here. Must be 21+. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER. Bet365 Sportsbook is dishing out an amazing welcome offer too. All you have to do is create an account, deposit at least $10 and place a $1 wager on any available matchup.
