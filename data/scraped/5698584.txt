  New models of care have changed the way healthcare professionals operate. Even with the pressure of new rules and regulations, healthcare facilities are still obligated to provide the best care possible to patients. Healthcare organizations are investing heavily in people, processes, and technology. The costs of recruiting experienced and certified HIM and RCM professionals have increased dramatically, given the growing need for talent. Qualified coders and CDI specialists are best equipped to deal with constantly changing coding guidelines, but providers can increase revenue while lowering costs with a small technology investment. Revenue cycle management has become more challenging for hospitals since the implementation of ICD-10. However, artificial intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) simplify mid-revenue cycle management processes and workflows. Advanced computer-assisted coding (CAC), for example, is revolutionizing and dramatically streamlining coding workflows - increasing revenue and elevating value-based care. Health Information Management (HIM) departments are the biggest beneficiaries of CAC applications. Some of the most significant advantages of using CAC include: Natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), semantic web, and high-performance cloud computing are among the cutting-edge technologies used by AGS Health in the development of healthcare IT solutions. The goal is to put operational data in the hands of healthcare professionals so they can identify at-risk patients, disease patterns, and treatment outcomes ahead of time. AGS creates user-friendly healthcare IT solutions such as Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI), Computer-Assisted Coding (CAC), Medical Transcription, and Analytics.
