Bengaluru-based Cashfree, which counts State Bank of India, Apis Partners, Smilegate Investment and Y Combinator as its investors, said that the elevations are aimed to accelerate its growth. Tikoo, who was earlier the senior vice president (SVP) in business and strategy at Cashfree, will be responsible for handling growth, partnerships, products, and expansion into newer markets. While, Venkatesan, who was the senior vice president (SVP) in engineering, will handle the company’s technology, engineering and innovation strategies. Founded in 2015 by Akash Sinha and Reeju Datta, Cashfree offers full-stack payment solutions to businesses, allowing them to collect payments and make payouts via different digital payment instruments.  Its clientele includes Nykaa, FirstCry, Nature's Basket, BigBasket, Zomato, Noise, Bella Vita Organic and MyFitness among others.
