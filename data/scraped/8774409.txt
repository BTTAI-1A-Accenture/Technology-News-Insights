This weekend marks a first for the WWE.¬†Clash at the Castle 2024¬†is the first Premium Live Event (PLE) to run in Scotland. The trip to Scotland is part of WWE's continued effort to host events in international territories. The last two PLEs were in Saudi Arabia and France, and the next PLE will take place in Canada. Drew McIntyre, a Scottish native, headlines this monumental card. McIntyre won the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 40, but the title reign only lasted a few minutes. CM Punk distracted McIntyre long enough for Damia Priest to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and win the title. Now, McIntyre gets his rematch with Priest in front of his home crowd. Will it be a storybook ending for McIntyre? The final leg of the Triple Crown will take place Saturday at the 2024 Belmont Stakes. Known as "The Test of the Champion," the Belmont Stakes is typically held at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. Due to construction at Belmont, the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes will be in upstate New York at Saratoga Race Course. Ten horses are running in the Belmont Stakes, including 2024 Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and 2024 Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey. With Seize the Grey's win over Mystik Dan at the Preakness, there will be no Triple Crown winner in 2024. Seize the Grey, Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone, and Mindframe should be in contention to win the Belmont.
