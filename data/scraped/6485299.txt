A learning management system (LMS) is used to create, manage, and deliver educational courses or training programs. It is designed to help educators or trainers organize materials and effectively instruct learners, while also assessing learner progress. An LMS is used in various environments, including schools and universities for academic learning, and businesses for training employees or educating customers. Absolutely, an LMS can play a crucial role in onboarding new employees, and can even make it fun if you use a platform that gamifies learning. It allows organizations to create comprehensive and consistent training programs that can be accessed by new hires, regardless of their location.
