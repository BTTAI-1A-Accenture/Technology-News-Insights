Dave Chappelle reportedly bashed San Francisco in a surprise show in the city last week. According to a review by SFGATE, the comedian and Ohio resident focused on homelessness during his set at the Masonic Auditorium in San Francisco, reportedly asking the crowd: “What ... happened to this place?” Chappelle was in San Francisco last week for the Golden State Warriors playoff game. During the show, he said San Francisco has become "half 'Glee,' half zombie movie," and told the audience that they and the city "need a Batman." Chappelle lives in Yellow Springs, a small village outside of Dayton. More:Elon Musk booed at Dave Chappelle show in San Francisco: 'That’s a lot of boos'
