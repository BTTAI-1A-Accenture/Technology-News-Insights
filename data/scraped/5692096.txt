 Erie Insurance ranked the highest among personal lines insurers in J.D. Power’s 2022 US Independent Agent Satisfaction Study. This marks the second consecutive year that Erie has taken the number-one spot. Erie Insurance took the top spot in all six study factors: claims processing, quoting, product offerings, servicing policies, support and communication, and commission. The company led all personal lines carriers in the study, scoring 838 on J.D. Power’s 1,000-point scale. Erie’s total score was more than 80 points higher than the personal lines segment average. “This recognition has special meaning for Erie because of our agent-centric model,” said Doug Smith, executive vice president of sales and products for Erie Insurance. “Our relationship with our agents is our most important asset, and we provide a robust support system to help them grow their business and deliver on our shared promise of service.” Read next: Erie Insurance launches venture capital fund The study was developed in alliance with the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America.
