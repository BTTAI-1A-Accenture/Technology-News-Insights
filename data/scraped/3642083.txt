ABET Accreditation Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org, under the General Criteria and the Civil and Similarly Named Program Criteria. Curriculum CEES has developed an innovative two semester capstone sequence. The first course in the sequence (Professional Practice) covers a lot of the non-technical issues associated with civil engineering practice (e.g., professional registration, ethics, and environmental regulations); the second course (Civil Engineering Capstone) focuses on a real world civil engineering design problem. The students are assembled into multi-disciplinary teams with architectural engineering students. The teams are structured to simulate a typical civil engineering consulting firm.  The student teams address a real-world design problem and their work is evaluated by practicing engineers. One past capstone class undertook the design of a Radar Innovations Laboratory for the OU research campus. CEES requires that all Civil Engineering students take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination prior to graduation. Curriculum Civil engineering is comprised of four areas of emphasis; environmental, geotechnical, structural and transportation engineering.  The undergraduate civil engineering student must complete a sequence of core engineering courses plus one or two courses in each of these areas. Students then choose three upper division Professional Electives in their preferred area of emphasis. The culmination of each bachelor of science degree program in CEES is a two-semester capstone sequence.  The capstone design experience requires students to draw upon various aspects of their undergraduate course work to develop a comprehensive solution to an open-ended problem.
