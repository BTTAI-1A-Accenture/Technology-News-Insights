Booth #CS640, which can be found in the show’s Discovery Zone, will feature i3 Engineering’s product line, consisting of 17 Atom Series controllers, six Atom Extension and mobile app i3 Home. A single controller can work with various types of loads to provide an easy and fast process to set up a smart home. “Our devices can be combined to a multi-master bus, which allows any of them to know what is happening to others,” said Pavlo Tsiupka, CEO of i3 Engineering. “A user or integrator creates an automation rule in a mobile app, which transmits to the device. The device processes the rule and sends the command to execute. For example, if the switch is turned on, then two lamps light up; if it is double-pressed, it raises the air temperature; if it’s a long press, it closes the curtains. We want every electrician to be able to set up an automation system of any complexity using our devices.  i3 Engineering’s system can manage various types of electrical equipment, such as lighting, sockets, heating and air conditioning systems, blinds and curtains, irrigation, etc. The system can be installed in private houses, apartments, greenhouses, restaurants, ships, business centres, shopping centres, hotels, etc. Having received the CE certificate in 2021, the company focused on growth in Ukraine and distribution markets where the frequency range of 50Hz 230V and 60Hz 127V is used. The company has partners in seven countries: Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Egypt, and Portugal. It is now looking for distributor companies that will give the company access to the Spanish, Italian and UK markets.
