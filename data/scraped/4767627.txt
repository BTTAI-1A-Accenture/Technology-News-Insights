Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test and review products.  Our expert review: ✅ You want low investment: For casual viewing, this telescope is a great option with a low price point.

✅ You don't want to spend ages setting it up: It arrives assembled and ready to go, so no complicated setup process needed. ❌ You want to find objects easily: It doesn't come with a finderscope, so anyone wanting to locate certain celestial objects easily may get frustrated.

❌ You want all the extras: This package doesn't include a finderscope, so you'll need to either buy one separately or consider another telescope package that does. 🔎 Celestron FirstScope 76 Tabletop Telescope If you have children who have been bugging you for a telescope and you can't quite commit to a moderately-priced instrument, then the FirstScope may be for you — especially if the Moon and casual glances at the night sky are of interest. ★★★★ As the name suggests, the Celestron FirstScope 76 is designed as a first telescope, which makes it ideal for kids because it comes out of the box fully assembled and ready to use. We thought the build felt very robust, and at 4.3 lbs (1.95kg), it's eminently portable and sits neatly on a table at home. It's also one of the most affordable scopes on the market, making it an excellent gift for younger kids to get their first glimpses of the night sky if you're unsure how long their interest in it may last. While it can't compete with more expensive telescopes, the views through this scope are still likely to thrill young stargazers. They'll be able to spot craters on the surface of the Moon and spy Jupiter surrounded by its Galilean moons: Io, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto. Saturn appears relatively faint and fuzzy, but you can still just about make out its rings and yellow coloration. The fast focal ratio and wide-angle view also make it ideal for spotting star clusters like Pleiades (Messier 45) in the constellation of Taurus, since all these points fit neatly into the field of view. In terms of optics, you're getting a Newtonian reflector with two eyepieces: a 20mm, which provides 15x magnification, and a 4mm, which provides 75x magnification. We advise investing in additional eyepieces to get the very best out of the 180x highest useful magnification. Unfortunately, the telescope is missing a finderscope to aid in navigation and alignment, making star-hopping particularly tricky, so we'd also recommend investing in a red dot finder for your telescope. Fortunately, these are relatively inexpensive to buy. Overall, this telescope's sturdy build, straightforward nature, and friendly price point make it a great choice for a kid's first scope, but more experienced stargazers will want to upgrade to something more powerful quite quickly. Our expert review: ✅ You want easy setup: We found this telescope to be very easy to set up and use, getting you stargazing in no time.

✅ You'll be traveling with it: As it's so portable and lightweight, it's very easy and convenient to take outside of the home, on camping trips or for long nights of stargazing. ❌ You're on a tight budget: This isn't the cheapest telescope on this list, however, it is better quality than the cheaper ones.

❌ You're not a beginner: This telescope is definitely geared more towards beginners, so we'd recommend going for something more advanced if your skills are further along. 🔎 Celestron Inspire 80AZ An excellent telescope for a beginner — especially given that a complete package is offered, exudes portability and is easy to use and set up. ★★★1/2 We think the Celestron Inspire 80AZ is a fantastic beginner telescope for older kids and teens looking to get hands-on with their astronomy. It's lightweight and portable and has an impressive build quality for the price. It also comes with one of the most complete kits we've ever seen in a beginner scope, so you'll have everything you need to get started, along with some handy additional features.  The 3.15-inch (80mm) aperture allows you to observe all the brighter solar system objects like the moon, Venus, Jupiter and Saturn, and also offers a closer view of bright deep-sky objects like the Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31) and the Orion Nebula (Messier 42). During our Celestron Inspire 80AZ review we were able to get clear views of the craters of the moon, albeit with a little color fringing. We think a moon filter would enhance the contrast and details of the image even more.  The telescope uses a manual slewing system that can be tricky to operate until you're used to it, so younger viewers may require some adult assistance to help them lock onto targets.   You get two Kellner eyepieces with this scope — a 20mm lens offering 45x magnification and a 10mm lens offering 90x magnification. If your child is likely to be in the hobby for the long-run, it might be worth investing in some further eyepieces to make the most of the Celestron Inspire 80AZ's optical system.   The accessories are what really make this telescope an appealing bundle for beginners. Celestron have included a StarPointer Pro finderscope which we found excellent to use, as well as a 90-degree erect image diagonal, a sturdy tripod, a red LED flashlight to help you see at night without inhibiting your night vision and a dust cap that doubles as a smartphone adapter so you can try your hand at some basic astrophotography. We think enthusiastic kids and teens would be thrilled with this package and all the possibilities it offers.   Our expert review: ✅ The whole family will use it: This telescope is user-friendly and good for users of all abilities.

✅ You want to travel with it: It's incredibly lightweight, so you can take it on camping trips or to dark sky sites as well as using it in your backyard. ❌ You're serious about astronomy: As we found the views are not 100% sharp across the frame, and its general beginner-friendly feel, it's best suited to younger users or anyone who isn't sure if it's a long-term hobby. 🔎 Orion SpaceProbe II 76 Particularly suited to skywatchers younger than ten. It would also work well for beginners who are new to skywatching and unsure if it will be a long-term hobby. ★★★ While the Orion SpaceProbe II 76 might not be the best choice for users more serious about astronomy, we've found it to be a great option for youngsters just getting started. As a reflector telescope, it's perhaps the best kind for beginners thanks to its innate light-gathering power. Indeed, we've found that this particular scope collects up to 60% more light than similar beginner scopes. Considering it costs less than $100, that's a real achievement. The Orion SpaceProbe II provides an aperture of 2.99 -inches (76mm), which — like the aforementioned Celestron FirstScope — will reveal the solar system, lunar surface and a selection of bright deep-sky targets.  Out of the box, the Orion SpaceProbe II can provide magnification levels of 28x and 70x, but with additional accessories that can expand up to 152x. It also comes with two eyepieces (10mm and 25mm), a red dot finder and a moon map. The red dot finder is seriously useful in simplifying star hopping, and it's a major plus that one's included in the box here. We love the wide-field views offered by the Orion SpaceProbe II. It's great for viewing objects like nebulas and star clusters, but you'll really get the most out of this telescope when viewing moons and planets.  Weighing 7.05 lbs (3.2kg), it's not the absolute lightest telescope on the market, but it's still very portable—whether you're just moving it into the backyard or taking it on a camping trip, it's easy enough to carry or pop in the car. Despite its comparative lightness, it's still plenty sturdy: Its steel tube construction is durable, so you won't have to worry about the odd knocks and bumps. We should probably mention that, because of the SpaceProbe II's spherical mirror, the views aren't completely sharp, and that's why we wouldn't necessarily recommend it for more seasoned astronomers. For youngsters just getting started, though, getting up close and personal with Saturn or the Moon's craters is bound to be pleasing.  We'd recommend the Orion SpaceProbe II for newcomers to astronomy under the age of ten. If you're older and want a cheap, inexpensive place to start, this can also be a decent option thanks to its low price point. Our expert review: ✅ You have a small budget: This telescope is very affordable, although you do get what you pay for. ❌ You want something that's going to last: We noted in our review that it wouldn't be enough to hold the interest of beginners for a long time.

❌ You want to see deep-sky objects: While you can see some deep-sky objects, we found them to appear quite dull, so we'd recommend looking elsewhere. 🔎 Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ: This lightweight chromatic refractor uses its relatively long length to produce natural-looking views of planets and the Moon, but for anything else it's underwhelming. It's also quite difficult to lock onto targets. ★★★ The Celestron AstroMaster 70AZ is a 2.7-inch (70mm) achromatic refractor telescope aimed squarely at beginners looking to get great views of objects within our solar system. It features an unusually long 35-inch (900mm) tube, which it uses to create a focal ratio of f/13. The benefit of this is that it doesn't suffer from the chromatic aberration, or 'false color,' that is common to other achromatic refractor beginner telescopes, enabling it to offer true-color views of the Moon and planets without any purple or pinkish haloes around them. This telescope is a complete kit. It comes with an adjustable tripod that can be used at full or half height, a StarPointer finderscope to help with alignment, and an L-shaped erect image diagonal that makes it easier to use the telescope while standing upright. You also get two Kellner eyepieces—a 20mm eyepiece for wide-angle views at 45x magnification and a 10mm eyepiece for high-powered views at 90x magnification. You can get nice, natural-looking views of the Moon and planets, allowing you to pick out Saturn's rings and some of Jupiter's moons. Still, the focal ratio of f/13 doesn't allow enough light in for good views of deep-sky objects like the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). It is, therefore, most suited to beginner astronomers looking for realistic views of our solar system. As expected at this price point, this is a manual telescope, but we were pleased to see that it features a panhandle with a clutch for securing it in position and adjusting the field of view. Unfortunately, while it's straightforward to set up, it can be tricky to aim the telescope and lock onto targets due to a bit of overreach and recoil. Our expert review: ✅ You want alignment technology: The SkyAlign technology makes aligning your telescope a breeze, all at the touch of a button.

✅ You want something portable: This telescope is lightweight and easy to transport, making it a great option to take on camping trips to dark sky sites. ❌ You don't want technology: This telescope requires the use of its app in order to function, so users looking for a more traditional approach should look elsewhere. 🔎 Celestron AstroFi 102 A basic telescope best suited to lunar and planetary observation. The motorized mount can initially be tricky to set up for beginners, but it comes at a reasonable price for a decent night sky view ★★★½ The Celestron Astro Fi 102 is an excellent value for money telescope. It combines advanced technology, great customer support and portability, resulting in a solid telescope that's great for beginner and tech-savvy skywatchers. You'll get everything you need to begin right out of the box. The Celestron Astro Fi comes with 10mm and 25mm eyepieces (offering magnifications of 132x and 53x), a red dot finder and a smartphone adapter (perfect for trying out astrophotography for beginners). The best part is this all comes in a lightweight package, making this a telescope that's easily transported. In our Celestron Astro Fi 102 review, we praised the great views provided by the optics and noted how great it was in particular at providing excellent views of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Its four-inch aperture is great for getting clear, detailed views of the Moon's terrain too. We also used it to gaze at the Andromeda Galaxy, and playing with the magnification a little allowed us to see its disk too. Perhaps our favorite thing about the family-friendly telescope, though, is that is makes use of Celestron's proprietary SkyAlign technology. By using your smartphone and the Celestron SkyPortal app, you can automatically align your telescope to the night sky. In other words, the app will determine your position in the world, making it easy to point you toward any visible object in the night sky. It's a fantastic piece of technology that makes viewing celestial objects not only super easy, but a great deal of fun. Naturally, given the price point of the Astro Fi 102 telescope, some corners have been cut in order to keep it light. That means it's got external plastic casing rather than metal, so it's not as robust as some other telescopes on the market. It does keep the cost down along with its weight, though, and as long as you take good care when moving it around it shouldn't pose any issues.  Our expert review: ✅  You want to view deep space: One Amazon reviewer suggested that this scope is “better suited to low power views of open star clusters like the Pleiades, and select deep sky objects like the Andromeda Galaxy” rather than our nearer neighbors like Jupiter, Saturn, or the moon.  ✅You want to observe the landscape: Users liked that the optics brought their surrounding environment into sharp focus. ❌  This is your child's first telescope: Users mention that the focuser can be clunky and difficult to use, making it unsuitable for beginners, who will likely find this frustrating. ❌You want super-crisp optics: This isn’t going to give you the sharp images of a more powerful telescope, and smartphone photos might not be of the quality you want, but it’s a great place to start.  🔎 Celestron Popular Science AstroMaster 80mm: This telescope makes a great option for more experienced young astronomers who want to stargaze independently and get a closer look at deep space.  ★★★★ For slightly more experienced young stargazers, the Celestron Popular Science AstroMaster 80mm telescope is an appealing option. This scope is sturdy, portable and easy to set up. It comes with an Alt-azimuth mount that allows for accurate pointing and smooth tracking, thanks to the clutch control, and it also has a pan handle for ease of movement and a satisfying, steady grip. While it is advertised as suitable for terrestrial and celestial viewing, users have noted that it is a fast telescope (f/5) best suited for viewing deep space or local terrain, as the moon and planets tend to show up rather bright, obscuring some finer detail. However, there is a moon filter included in the kit which can be used to reduce moon glare for more detailed and satisfying lunar viewing. The scope has a prism diagonal that presents the view through the eyepiece as the right side up, which users found handy and is designed to make viewing more comfortable. The smartphone adaptor will also allow you to take pictures through the scope using Bluetooth functionality to release the shutter — a fun addition for youngsters who want to try their hand at astrophotography. You won’t need any tools to set this up, making it handy for young amateurs who might want to undertake setup by themselves and stargaze independently. Kids telescopes are still an intricate piece of kit, so there are a few things to consider when choosing one.  First and foremost is probably the price. Chances are, if you're buying a telescope for a child or teenager, it's their first venture into astronomy, so you won't want to spend a fortune if you're not sure they'll take to skywatching.  While telescopes for kids work just like standard ones, you'll want to make sure the model you choose is easy to put together and intuitive to use to make it easier for them. Of course, you'll also want to supervise children while they skywatch and teach them how to use the telescope.  The first thing to consider when buying a good kids telescope is the price. It's likely if you're buying a telescope for a child or teen, they're brand new to astronomy — you don't want to spend a fortune on something that might not become a serious hobby. Functionality is another important consideration. You can choose either a traditional telescope, or a GoTo one that has motorized functions and app support. Both are great and reliable options, but you'll want to choose one depending on yours and your family's preferences.  Choosing a sturdy telescope is probably a good move when buying one suitable for kids. However, the most robust models can also cost a pretty penny, so there's a fine balance between finding a telescope that can handle being used by kids and one that won't break the bank. All of these considerations were taken into account when we reviewed telescopes and ranked them in this guide. We've made sure to include a range of telescopes with different functions and at different price points, so you'll be sure to find a model that works for you. Our top pick for the best telescope for kids is the Celestron Inspire 80AZ. We loved the fact it is simple to put together and easy to operate, but also that it comes with plenty of accessories. It even gives you the ability to take basic pictures with your smartphone.  The Celestron FirstScope 76 is the best tabletop scope, in our opinion, but we've had to replace it with the Sky-Watcher Explorer 130 EQ2 in our guide as it was often out of stock. If you can find the Sky-Watcher Explorer, it's a great choice for kids - it has a really sophisticated tracking ability and comes at a reasonable price. Choosing the best telescope for kids starts with establishing what they might want to observe. This will then help you determine whether to go for a refractor, reflector or a catadioptric telescope.  A refractor telescope is the best option to observe the Moon or planets, which require high magnification. As an added bonus, these telescopes tend to be small, lightweight, easier to operate and cheaper than others. On the other hand, if you want to observe fainter objects such as nebulas or distant galaxies, you might want to opt for a reflector telescope due to their light-gathering capabilities.  Catadioptrics are a hybrid between refractor and reflector telescopes, and they come in two forms: Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov-Cassegrain. This type of telescope tends to be most user-friendly and modern than some of the others, and they're usually computerized, so they're great for viewing a wide range of objects. Catadioptric telescopes are usually computerized so they tend to be more expensive than other types of telescopes. For that reason, if your child is new to skywatching, we'd recommend starting with a different, cheaper type of telescope, in case they don't take to the hobby. However, if you think you want a catadioptric telescope, you can find some in our best beginner telescopes guide. While the best telescopes for kids are fully functional telescopes, you might want to opt for a slightly more sophisticated model that works for the whole family. Our guide to the best telescopes guide has plenty of options for a range of budgets and abilities. The best binoculars are a cheaper alternative and can still deliver great views of the night sky. When choosing a telescope for kids, we'd recommend you steer clear novelty models and cheaper models. Investing in a reliable telescope means you'll be guaranteed good quality optics, and children are more likely to enjoy skywatching sessions. There is no set age to start using a telescope. In theory, as long as your child has good eyesight and good enough motor skills to look through an eyepiece, they can use one. Of course, for kids under the age of six or even will need adult supervision while they are stargazing. Over that age, it's still advisable to keep both the child and telescope safe. Here at Space.com, we review each telescope to ensure that our recommendations for the best telescopes to buy are honest and current. Our reviews are based on various criteria, including construction and design, optical function, and field performance. Aperture: The diameter of the primary mirror or lens that allows a telescope to gather light.
Field of view: Area of sky visible through the eyepiece.
Focal length: A telescope's tube length. Short focal lengths offer a wide field of view and a small image.
Focal ratio: Also known as the telescope's speed. Small focal ratios provide lower magnifications, a wide field of view and a brighter image.
Magnification: Relationship between the telescope's optical system and the eyepiece.  Each telescope is carefully tested by our expert staff or knowledgeable freelance contributors who know their subject areas in depth. This ensures fair reviewing is backed by personal, hands-on experience with each telescope and is judged based on its price point, class and destined use. For example, comparing a 10-inch Dobsonian to a 2.76-inch refractor wouldn't be appropriate though each telescope might be the best pick in their own class. We look at how easy it is to set up, whether computerized or motorized mounts are reliable and quiet, and if the telescope comes with appropriate eyepieces and a functional tripod. We also suggest wether a particular telescope would benefit from any additional kit to give you the best experience possible.
