As a first-round draft pick, it’s understood that former Clemson defensive end Myles Murphy will be under pressure to be a major contributor for the Cincinnati Bengals sooner than later. He’ll also have the opportunity to change the perception that highly regarded edge rushers out of Clemson have exhibited a tendency to underperform in the NFL. Indeed, Clemson has produced plenty of standout interior lineman that have flourished in the NFL, including Dexter Lawrence, Christian Wilkins, Grady Jarrett, and Murphy’s new teammate, D.J. Reader.
