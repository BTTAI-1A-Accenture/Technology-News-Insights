Read more I'm noticing that on the pictures for this tablet, it has 2 front cameras, but there's only 1 on mine. Not entirely sure if they were 2 different models or something. Anyway, I'm not a big fan of this tablet. When I first got it in 202... This tablet doesn't receive updates anymore, so you won't get any new security updates unfortunately. I agree 100% that this is a good tablet for studying and multimedia consumption. It falls short for gaming however, so it is definitely a student's tablet or a working person's daily driver.
