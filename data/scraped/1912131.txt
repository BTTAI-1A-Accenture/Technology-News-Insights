In Metallurgy and Materials we explore how materials behave and how they can be used and improved. Working closely with industry, much of our research is focussed on reducing our environmental impact on the world and includes materials and technologies for electrification, recycling of critical materials, and developing green energy solutions.Our research-intensive teaching gives students a learning experience that generates the most sought-after and transferable skills. Our research interests are reflected in the range of taught and research degrees we offer, from Materials to Aerospace, Space to Fusion. See our latest news
