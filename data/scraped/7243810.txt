On Saturday, the Phillies lost their fourth consecutive game in head-scratching fashion.  In the bottom of the sixth inning, and the game scoreless with two outs, Guardians slugger Jose Ramirez sent what seemed like a harmless fly ball to shallow right center field.  Phillies second baseman Bryson Stott went back on the ball, while center fielder Brandon Marsh closed in for the out. Right fielder Nick Castellanos, who closed in late on the play, also had an opportunity to run under the routine pop fly.  Instead, the three players inexplicably allowed the ball to hit the grass.  The virtual three-player blunder allowed speedy Guardians infielder Amed Rosario, who was running hard on contact with two outs, to come around and score all the way from first base.  The one run was the deciding factor in the Guardians’ 1–0 win, spoiling a splendid outing by ace Zach Wheeler, who went seven strong innings allowing just five hits while striking out eight.  To compound matters, the Phillies were unable to make up for their mistake in the field, managing just two hits over nine innings, with Cleveland’s Tanner Bibee besting Wheeler by hurling seven scoreless frames to earn the win. Philadelphia, who is in the thick of the NL wild card hunt, will try to avoid being swept by Cleveland when they send Aaron Nola to the bump on Sunday.  Frank Taddeo is Sports Illustrated's senior betting analyst and is a successful high stakes fantasy football player.
