Submitted photo  NORWAY — Utilizing monies received through fundraising efforts and donations, the Cancer Resource Center of Western Maine made 50 care baskets to distribute to cancer patients located in western Maine. The baskets contain cleaning supplies, paper products and personal hygiene items. This is the third year of the project, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of many cancer patients not being able to purchase these items with their food stamps. Several volunteers helped put the baskets together. For more information, contact Diane Madden, executive director of the Cancer Resource Center of Western Maine, at dmadden@crcofwm.org or 207-890-0329.     Comments are not available on this story.
