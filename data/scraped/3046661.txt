Julia Fox has managed to construct a wardrobe more polarizing than that of anyone else in Hollywood â€” including Lady Gaga. Working with stylist Briana Andalore, the 33-year-old "Uncut Gems" star and new author of "Down the Drain" has cemented a moment in pop culture with her kitschy street style outfits gawked at by fans and fellow runway show attendees alike. Sitting front row at Fashion Week presentations such as Wiederhoeft, where she memorably rocked both a wedding gown and poodle dress; Diesel, where she outfitted her son Valentino in matching denim; and Naomi Campbell's PrettyLittleThing collection debut, where she arrived in nothing but chains and a patent leather trench coat, Fox is nothing if not courageous, pushing the sartorial envelope wherever she goes.   Though she rose to fame while dating Kanye West, and simultaneously stepping into the spotlight at Paris Haute Couture Week in 2022, Fox is a model, actor, and artist in her own right. She recently partnered with Victoria's Secret on The Tour '23, fronting the newest iteration of the show in a plunging yellow minidress designed by Lagos-based designer Bubu Ogisi. She also wore the above metal-plated corset gown and sheer, gauzy gloves to the "Something You Said Last Night" premiere in New York on Sept. 22, celebrating her role as executive producer on the film.
