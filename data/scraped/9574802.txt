SITE PARTNER:   Tico Bakery is a tiny artisan Asian patisserie tucked away in a suburban street in Rochedale South, having moved there from its previous location in Spring Hill. Signature products on offer are bespoke crepe cakes, cake cups, cheesecake, mousse cake and macarons, with everything baked onsite with quality fresh sourced ingredients. Tico Bakery's delicious mille crepe cakes come in flavours like peach oolong, matcha, chocolate hazelnut and strawberry and are perfect for any occasion. Like the cakes, macarons here are also a work of art and come with luscious fillings and can be crafted for special events like baby showers, birthdays and kids parties. Mousse cakes are another house specialty as are cake cups in flavours like Oreo and soy custard, heavenly cake rolls, Black Forest cake and tiramisu. Tico Bakery also does incredible special occasion cakes from everything from christenings, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries and more. Need to know - There is free onstreet parking nearby. After a temporary closure, Tico Bakery re-opens to customers from Friday May 19. Images courtesy of Tico Bakery Facebook page.
