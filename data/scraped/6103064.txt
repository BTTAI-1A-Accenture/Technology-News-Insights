Selected Highlights: Michael Ewing, Chairman of the Board and CEO said, "We are very pleased to report an increase in earnings per share of 52.17% on a quarter-over-quarter basis and 60.47% on a year-over-year basis. Core deposits increased $31.76 million since year-end 2022 as we continue to benefit from the dislocation in the industry. We have deployed these proceeds into earning assets with attractive risk/return characteristics. This disciplined approach has contributed to higher levels of earnings for the quarter and year-to-date." Mr. Ewing concluded, "We strongly believe that community banks build better communities. In doing so, we manage the Company to seek the optimal balance among safety and soundness, profitability, and growth - in that order. As we continue this journey, we will maintain these straightforward principles which we believe will give us the strength to meet the financial needs of our customers, support our communities and optimize value for our shareholders." Net Interest Income The net interest margin was 2.99% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared to 3.13% for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The net interest margin was 3.04% and 3.12% for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Interest income increased $3.52 million and $6.71 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, as a result of increased investment opportunities to deploy capital into investments with attractive risk and return characteristics and increased loan income due primarily to the higher interest rate environment. Interest expense increased $2.46 million and $4.45 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Increases in interest expense are primarily attributable to interest expense related to the issuance of subordinated debt in February 2022, interest expense paid on deposits resulting from increases in volume and in interest rates, and interest expense paid on FHLB advances and other borrowings due to higher balances needed to deploy capital into higher yielding investment opportunities. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $386,233 and $727,774 for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Debit card interchange fee income was the largest contributor of noninterest income totaling $193,073 and $361,880, for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $2.85 million and $5.65 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Salaries and employee benefits were the largest category of noninterest expense, which totaled $1.66 million and $3.39 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. Salaries and employee benefits increased as a result of newly added positions, an overall increase in employee benefits, including health insurance premiums and the increase in quarterly incentive compensation paid to all employees as a result of the Company's exceptional financial performance. Liquidity The Company's liquidity position was very strong with $434.99 million of liquid assets available which included cash, unencumbered securities available for sale, and secured borrowing capacity as of June 30, 2023, compared to $379.25 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company is in a very strong position regarding the liquidity concerns facing the banking industry, caused by the ability of large depositors to withdraw deposit balances that exceed the FDIC insurance limits.
