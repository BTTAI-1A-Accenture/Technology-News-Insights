NetApp Inc (NASDAQ:NTAP) stock is near the top of the SPX today, last seen 2.5% higher to trade at $79.51. Susquehanna upgraded the software stock to "positive" from "neutral," with a price-target hike to $100 from $62 to go with it. The analyst in coverage is bullish on the company's margins and spend cycles heading into 2024. NTAP is up 32% in 2023, and a chip shot from its July 21 annual high of $80.53.  Homebuilder stock PulteGroup Inc (NYSE:PHM) is on the other end of the spectrum, down 5.8% to trade at $77.88, although there's no specific catalyst.
