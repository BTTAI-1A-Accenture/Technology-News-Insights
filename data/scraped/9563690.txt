The company announced earlier this yearit is creating a master plan for the property, which may include reducing its operations at that site.    Thrivent describes the development in this way: The survey starts by asking demographic information, including the physical relationship to the site. It asks people to pick their top three issues for planning of the site. Options include: "Provide Employment Opportunities", "Provide a variety of housing choices, including affordable options", "Provide shopping and service amenities", "Enhance connectivity (walking and biking trails) in the community", and "Provide high-quality public spaces." It asks which aspects of a "complete community" are most important, as well ranking healthy lifestyle options. Other questions address housing options, sustainability features, and desired amenities in public spaces. The company asks for the survey to be completed by Oct. 15.
