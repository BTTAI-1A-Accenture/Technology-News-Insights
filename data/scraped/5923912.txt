Published on By Futterwave, Africa’s leading payments technology company, has announced its partnership with SHiiP, Nigeriaâs leading courier service. The collaboration aims to improve deliveries for Flutterwave Store SMEs and large-scale merchants across the African continent. With over 40,000 small-business entrepreneurs using the Flutterwave Store, the alliance with SHiiP will provide a seamless end-to-end e-commerce experience. Flutterwave merchants will be able to select from a range of over 80 domestic and international couriers including DHL, FedEx, UPS, Flocargo, Shippo, and Flo Express, for the transportation of goods in cheaper delivery rates. The integration will provide SMEs and online shoppers with a smooth transaction checkout, and also enable merchants to successfully ship internationally. They will no longer be restricted by the headaches that occur with cross-border logistical services as the options for international shipping will be handled exclusively by SHiiP and their international couriers. Consequently, the empowerment this logistics integration will bring to SME owners and online shoppers will be endless. The SHiiP integration to the Flutterwave store will provide SME owners in Nigeria the control to organise and track delivery couriers directly from their Flutterwave dashboard without the previous hassles. âWe are delighted to be partnering with SHiiP as we share the same goal to make the ecosystem of commerce simpler and more empowering for SMEs and large scale merchants in Africa,” said Onyedikachim, Nwankwo, Flutterwaveâs Head of Product Marketing. “The benefits of this integration to our customers will be immensely valuable to their customer satisfaction. We pride ourselves in continuing to provide merchants with innovative technological tools that are designed to help grow their business.â Ridwan Rasheed, Co-Founder, COO & Head of Products, SHiiP noted that the company is thrilled about the partnership. “It is a significant milestone for both companies and represents our commitment to driving innovation and enabling the growth of African businesses through seamless shipping options. “Flutterwave merchants can now offer dependable and cost-effective shipping services to their customers without having to worry about the logistical issues of delivering items across the continent,” Rasheed added.
