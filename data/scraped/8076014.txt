 Peter Hillary, mountaineer and son of noted explorer Sir Edmund has put his backing behind a bid to save the Ruapehu ski fields. Peter Hillary agreed to become the Founding Patron of the Ruapehu Skifield Stakeholders Association (RSSA) to guarantee a future for operations on Mt Ruapehu. The organisation has launched a crowdfunding campaign as the first step towards keeping Mt Ruapehu’s two commercial ski fields in public hands. Peter Hillary says the Ruapehu ski fields are the 'jewel of Central North Island tourism' and keeping them active is vital. "It would be analogous to letting all of the ski resorts and alpine activities of the Queenstown area disappear off the landscape. It would have a devastating impact."  LISTEN ABOVE Take your Radio, Podcasts and Music with you
