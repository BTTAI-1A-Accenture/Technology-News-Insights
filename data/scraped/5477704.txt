Sean McDermott of the Buffalo Bills may be one of the many coaches against the NFL's latest rule change. On Tuesday, the NFL announced that they passed a new rule that all touchbacks fair catches inside the 25-yard line on kickoffs will see the ball automatically moved to the 25-yard line like it would if a returner was to take a knee in the endzone. McDermott was asked about this new rule in a recent appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, and his answer showed a lot about his thoughts on the subject without ever providing any substance. “I’d like the money to stay in my pocket,” McDermott told McAfee about the new special teams rule.  This seemingly non-answer, which lets the viewers know how he feels about it, is a very similar performance to ex-Bills running back Marshawn Lynch, where he showed up to a Super Bowl media day and answered every question with the infamous response of "I'm just here so I won't be fined." So why do so many NFL coaches dislike this new rule regarding special teams? After all, it seems like maybe it could be an advantage.  However, many believe this won't be the last rule change that affects special teams, as the NFL made this new one to increase "player safety."  Coaches are now worried that in a few years, the value of special teams will be diminished as the NFL changes part of that side of the game in the name of player safety. Now, all that McDermott can control is focusing on his new role as Buffalo’s defensive play-caller while also maintaining head-coaching duties as the Bills continue with their offseason programs.  Thanks for reading our SI-powered coverage of your Buffalo Bills ...
