Seven rounds, 14 races, six tracks and four countries await the class of 2023 The provisional 2023 Northern Talent Cup calendar can now be revealed! A seven-round, 14-race season awaits the class of 2023, with six tracks in four countries ready to play host. The season starts with a test at Oschersleben before the first round of the year alongside WorldSBK at the classic TT Circuit Assen, and from there it’s back to Germany as the Sachsenring and Oschersleben host Rounds 2 and 3 alongside IDM. The NTC then joins the MotoGP™ paddock for the German Grand Prix back at the Sachsenring, before visits to Most, the Red Bull Ring and Hockenheim to round out the season back with IDM at three more incredible venues. There’s still time to apply to join the grid too, with applications open until the 31st of December 2022. Click HERE to apply, and find the full calendar below!
