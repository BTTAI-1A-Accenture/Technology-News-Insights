A Lehigh Valley lawmaker is taking another shot at protecting Pennsylvania children from carbon monoxide leaks at day cares. Carbon monoxide detectors are currently not required for child care centers in Pennsylvania, despite repeated efforts by state legislators to change that. State Rep. Jeanne McNeill, D-Lehigh County, last year sponsored a bill for the requirement, but it languished in committee. On Friday, McNeill announced she was reintroducing her legislation, which would require one or more alarms in buildings that house child care facilities with possible sources of carbon monoxide. A key difference this time around is Democrats won control of the Pennsylvania House in special elections earlier this year. The House health committee chair is Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny County, and Rep. Kathy Rapp is the Republican chair. The new push for the legislation comes after a carbon monoxide leak last fall in Allentown sickened nearly 30 children and five adults. Crews were called the morning of Oct. 11 for an unconscious child at Happy Smiles Learning Center in Allentown. As firefighters arrived, air quality detectors on their gear went off and they began to evacuate the building, officials previously said. Victims were taken to area hospitals for treatment. Lehigh Valley Heath Network said the patients it received suffered from carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and had 3 to 10 times more than the normal level in their blood. The cause was a malfunctioning heating unit and blocked venting system. Last week, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services announced certified child care providers could one or two free carbon monoxide detectors from School Health, paid for with federal child care funding and available through April 30.
