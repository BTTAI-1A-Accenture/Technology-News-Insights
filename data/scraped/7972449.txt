How much is Twitter worth? One-third of what Elon Musk paid for the social media platform. That’s according to asset manager Fidelity, which recently marked down the value of its stake in Twitter. The billionaire Twitter owner who bought the struggling company in October for $44 billion has admitted he overpaid. He recently said Twitter is worth less than half of what he forked over. Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund’s stake in Twitter was valued at $6.6 million as of April 28, down from $19.7 million at the end of October, according to a report issued Sunday. This marked the third time Fidelity cut the value of its Twitter stake, Bloomberg reported.  Earlier this month, Musk said he would step down as CEO, naming former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino. The Fidelity report is dated April 28 so it preceded the Yaccarino announcement. Netflix ends password sharing. What now?Netflix has lowered the boom on password sharing. What you should do now.

Under Musk, Twitter has struggled to keep users engaged and advertisers from fleeing. Last week, Twitter hosted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s presidential campaign announcement on Twitter Spaces but the event was besieged by technical problems. Musk has said he would continue to play a significant role at Twitter as executive chairman and chief technology officer.
