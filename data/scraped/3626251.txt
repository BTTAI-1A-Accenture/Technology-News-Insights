NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT The Kremlin has manufactured its first batch of high-speed nuclear-armed underwater drones, according to Russian state media reports. The ‘Poseidon’ torpedo has the power to trigger a huge ‘radioactive’ tsunami with waves reaching up to 500 metres (1,640ft) high, it is claimed. Details of the underwater propulsion system have been a closely guarded secret. But it is alleged to have an ‘unlimited range’, approaching targets at a speed of 125mph (200kmph). The development was reported by Russian news agency, TASS, which claims the first batch will be delivered to special-purpose nuclear-powered submarine, Belgorod.   Successful trials have been conducted on core components of the drones, including the nuclear power unit, a military and defence source told the agency. A key ally of President Vladimir Putin, propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov, called for Moscow to ‘plunge Britain into the depths of the sea’ with its ‘underwater robotic drone’, in retaliation for supporting Ukraine.  Kiselyov said on Russian television in May last year: ‘There is no way to stop this underwater drone.  ‘It has a warhead with a capacity of 100 megatons. ‘The explosion of this thermonuclear torpedo close to Britain’s shores would raise a giant wave, a tsunami, up to 500metres (1,640ft) high. ‘This tidal wave is also a carrier of extremely high doses of radiation.

He called for a initial nuclear test on the Arctic island of Novaya Zemlya in northern Russia, to make ‘the whole earth shudder’.

Putin sees the Poseidon as crucial to his military supremacy over the West, reports suggest – as the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches on February 24.   Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, the country has suffered widespread damages and loss of life amid a major bombing campaign. Millions of people have fled the country, with thousands of British people opening up their homes to Ukrainian refugees. During the course of the war, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has remained in Kyiv, despite the Ukrainian capital being subjected to a barrage of bombing. Zelensky has continuously pushed for aid and support from world leaders, as well as pressing for fast-tracked NATO membership. Meanwhile, Russia's President Vladimir Putin has been widely condemned for his attack on Ukraine. His actions have been met by harsh economic sanctions, bans from competing in major sporting events, and countries moving away from using Russian oil. Chief analyst of the Russian General Staff, Admiral Igor Katasonov, said the Poseidon system’s ‘unique characteristics’ will ‘help the Navy to successfully combat aircraft carriers and strike groups of a potential adversary in any oceanic theatre of war and destroy shore infrastructure facilities.’ Morgan Stanley boss among missing after Bayesian yacht disaster Ancient pyramid suddenly collapses sparking 'bad omen' warning Volcano erupts after 7.0-magnitude earthquake, triggering 'code-red' for planes Boy, 10, stabbed to death while playing football in Spain On Friday another pro-Putin propagandist, warned World War Three had already begun – and called for Britain, France and Poland to be nuked in a bid to stop the supply of tanks and armoured vehicles from NATO countries to Ukraine. But Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced Britain will dispatch ‘game-changing’ tanks to Ukraine to aid its battle against Moscow.  Mr Sunak made the commitment during a call with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday – when he vowed to ‘seize the moment’ and help ‘push Russian troops back’.
