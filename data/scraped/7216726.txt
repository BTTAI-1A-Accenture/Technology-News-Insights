The 2023 MLB season is winding down, and there is a mixture of close battles and landslides. It has been clear for months now that the Braves would win the NL East. It has been clear for over a month the Dodgers would win the NL West and the Twins would win the AL Central.  But much of the playoff field remains unsettled. The race for the AL East is heating up between two teams all but guaranteed to be reach the postseason in the Orioles and the Rays, with not just the division title but the first overall seed in the American League on the line. The AL West is a similar gauntlet between the Astros, Rangers and Mariners, with three teams all within striking distance of the division title. The National League wild-card race has a clear frontrunner in the Phillies, but the last two spots are up for grabs as the Diamondbacks, Cubs, Reds and Marlins all vie for the chance to head to the winner of the NL Central division in the wild-card round.

If a team leading the division has 90 wins and the second-place team has 63 losses, their magic number would sit at 10. Sporting News will be tracking those magic numbers in the division races and wild card rounds. Info comes from MLB.com. The first number is for teams leading the division or wild-card races, and their magic number to reach the playoffs. The second number is the elimination number for teams trailing the division or wild-card races, and how far they are from playoff elimination. Two x's means a team has been eliminated from that race.
