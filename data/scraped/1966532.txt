Metadata quality is crucial for any library that wants to provide accurate, consistent, and accessible information to its users. However, measuring and improving metadata quality can be challenging, especially when dealing with diverse sources, formats, and standards. In this article you will learn some practical tips and tools to help you assess and enhance the quality of your library's metadata.
 
Metadata quality refers to how well the metadata elements describe, identify, and facilitate the discovery and use of the resources they represent. Metadata quality can be affected by factors like completeness, accuracy, consistency, currency, granularity, interoperability, and usability. Depending on the purpose and context of the metadata, different quality criteria and measures may apply.
 
Metadata quality has a direct impact on the user experience and satisfaction of your library's services. High-quality metadata can help users find what they need, understand what they find, and trust what they use. On the other hand, low-quality metadata can lead to frustration, confusion, and mistrust. Moreover, metadata quality can affect the efficiency and effectiveness of your library's workflows, such as cataloging, indexing, preservation, and sharing.
 
There is no single approach to measure metadata quality, but there are some common steps and approaches. Start by defining quality goals and requirements based on user needs, collection characteristics, and metadata standards. Then, choose appropriate quality indicators and metrics that reflect your goals and requirements. This could include quantitative indicators such as completeness, validity, and consistency, or qualitative indicators such as relevance, clarity, and usability. After that, select a representative sample of your metadata records to evaluate. This could be done with random sampling, stratified sampling, or purposive sampling depending on sample size and diversity. Finally, apply suitable quality assessment methods and tools to your sample. This could be manual methods such as peer review, user feedback, or expert judgment, or automated methods such as software tools, scripts, or algorithms.
 
Based on the results of your quality assessment, you can identify the strengths and weaknesses of your metadata and prioritize the areas that need improvement. Strategies to improve metadata quality include implementing quality control and assurance procedures throughout the metadata lifecycle, adopting and following best practices and guidelines, using metadata enrichment and transformation techniques, and collaborating with other metadata providers and consumers to ensure interoperability. These strategies can involve data validation, error checking, editing, using controlled vocabularies, applying consistent formats and rules, adding value-added elements, using crosswalks, mappings, or linked data, using common standards, schemas, and protocols.
 
There are many tools available to measure and improve metadata quality, such as OpenRefine, a powerful data cleaning and transformation tool that can handle various metadata formats and sources. Additionally, the Metadata Quality Assurance Framework is a web-based tool that assesses metadata records based on predefined or customized criteria and metrics. Catmandu is a command-line tool that can manipulate and convert metadata records between different formats and standards.
