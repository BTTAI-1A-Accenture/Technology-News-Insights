     A CVS store in D.C.'s Columbia Heights neighborhood is being ransacked. Customers are raising concerns about the location on 14th Street after noticing the shelves are completely empty. FOX 5's Sierra Fox reports from Northwest after checking it out. A group of roughly 45 kids routinely ransack a CVS in Washington, D.C., with many thieves taking the food and beverages and stomping on them, according to a Fox 5 report.  "When you walk into this CVS, you'd think the store is closing because there's barely anything on the shelves," Fox 5 reporter Sierra Fox said of a CVS in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of D.C. "In fact, the only items in stock are the ones that are locked up. I did ask an employee what gets stolen the most, and they just laughed and said ‘everything.’"  "A big group of kids, like 45 or more, walk in before school, after school and late at night to steal chips and drinks," Fox 5 reported Tuesday. "They even throw the food and beverages on the ground and stomp on them, leaving behind a big mess."  VIDEO SHOWS SAN FRANCISCO WALGREENS CHAIN FREEZERS SHUT AFTER SHOPLIFTERS ROB STORE 20 TIMES A DAY A group of roughly 45 kids routinely ransack a CVS in Washington, D.C., with many thieves taking the food and beverages and stomping on them, according to a Fox 5 report.  (Google Maps and Bloomberg via Getty Images) "Staff at CVS have been alerted that thieves are aware of when new shipments come in and that’s when they target the store," the outlet added.  Fox 5 was told that "street vendors are allegedly paying people to go in and steal stuff so they can resell it."  Fox 5 also reported that it noticed "street vendors selling toothbrushes, men and women body wash, car fresheners, as well as laundry and cleaning supplies, which are some of the same items no longer available at CVS. However, there is no direct evidence at this time that it did come from the store."  NEWS CREW IN SAN FRANCISCO WATCHES LIVE AS MAN BRAZENLY STEALS FROM A WALGREENS: 'DID THAT GUY PAY?' Some local Washington, D.C., residents try to empathize with the thieves clearing out CVS store shelves. (Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) Some local D.C. residents tried to empathize with the thieves clearing out CVS store shelves.  "I'm stuck, I mean, it's bad to do. At the same time, they're probably doing it for a reason," one person said. "They need those things, but they shouldn't just be going in and clearing the shelves because this isn't sustainable for the store."  "A lot of folks actually can't afford any of the things in there. I'm not saying that stealing has to be the solution to that, right?" another person said. "However, maybe if the city could provide more accessible resources to unhoused or under-income folks that can provide them hair care, bodily care, hygiene care, etc., that could be an option." CVS Lead Director of External Communications Amy Thibault provided the following statement to Fox News Digital: "The safety of our colleagues, customers and patients is our top priority and we’re committed to ensuring we have the products they need in our stores. In recent weeks, we’ve worked closely with the DC Metro Police to identify and dismantle several major shoplifting rings and will continue to do so. In addition, we’re supporting new initiatives to combat retail theft in partnership with the DC Attorney General's Office."
