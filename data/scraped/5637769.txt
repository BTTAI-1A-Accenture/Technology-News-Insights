   Date (MENAFN- America News Hour)  The Malaysian oil and gas midstream market is expected to register a CAGR of more than 1.08% during the forecast period. Factors, such as increasing demand for oil and rising investment in the pipeline and storage sectors, are expected to boost the demand for the Malaysian oil and gas midstream market during the forecast period. However, decreasing levels of oil and gas production, coupled with a lack of policies on oil stockpiling, has impeded growth in the oil and gas midstream sector.– LNG terminals capacity is expected to increase over the forecast period with the expansion and construction on new LNG terminals. New LNG terminals are expected to decrease the cost of transportation. The country was the third-largest exporter of LNG in the world.– Malaysia is expanding its oil terminal and storage capacity as the need for more oil storage, and trading grows within Asia. Like its neighbor, Singapore lacks the space to continue increasing its storage capacity. As Singapore runs out for space for oil and gas storage, companies in Malaysia can use it as an opportunity for further growth.– The gas and oil production in the country has been decreasing gradually over the years. This has become a cause of concern for the companies in the sector about future growth prospects. Therefore, falling production acts as a restraint for the market.

It is expected to have a capacity of 1.5 MTPA used mainly for exports. It is expected to be operational in 2020.– Consumption of oil increased in the country, by 2.60%, from 36 million metric ton, in 2017 to 36.9 million metric ton, in 2018. Production of oil in the country decreased by 0.55%, year on year, from 32.2, in 2015 to 31.5, in 2018.– Satu Malaysia Terminal is an LNG terminal in Sarawak, Malaysia. It constitutes 3 LNG trains and has a capacity of 8.1 million metric ton per annum (MTPA). It is a part of the Malaysia LNG Complex, also known as the Petronas Bintulu LNG Complex.– The Pengerang oil storage terminal in Johor is Malaysia's largest commercial oil storage facility. The storage terminal is owned by a joint venture of Vopak (Dutch) and of Dialog Group (Malaysia) and has a oil storage capacity of more than 8.2 million barrels.– Hence, LNG terminals is expected to increase slightly during the forecast period due to an increase in the consumption of oil and an increase in investments into the midstream sector.  Decreasing Production of Gas to Restraint the Market  – Consumption of natural gas decreased in the country, by 1.56%, year on year, from 37.8 million metric ton of oil equivalent (mtoe), in 2015 to 35.5 mtoe, in 2018. The production of gas has decreased in the country, approximately by 2.65%, from 64.0 mtoe, in 2017 to 62.3 mtoe, in 2018.– In 2019, the Peninsular Gas Utilization Project was an operating system of natural gas pipelines. The pipelines run from the Terengganu Gas Field offshore Malaysia to Kertih Gas Power Plant, then to various points in the Malaysian Peninsula. Pipeline capacity is around 5.2 billion cubic meters per year, and the length of the pipeline is approximately 2,500 kilometers.– The Sabah-Sarawak Gas Pipeline is an operating natural gas pipeline. The pipeline transports gas from Kimanis to Bintulu, converting it into liquefied natural gas (LNG) at the Petronas LNG Complex for export. The capacity of the pipe is around 7.7 billion cubic meters per year, and the length of the pipeline is approximately 512 kilometers.– In 2019, three pipeline contracts with the Chinese giant China National Petroleum Corporation were canceled by the new government upon allegations of charges of corruption in the dealings. Such endeavors reduce trust in the contracts signed between the government and investors.– The Malaysian oil and gas midstream industry is expected to grow slightly over the forecast period due to an increase in the consumption of oil and growth in the investment in the sector.
