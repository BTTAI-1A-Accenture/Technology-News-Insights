HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV) today announced that the 2023 Travelers Championship generated a tournament-record amount for charity – more than $3 million for more than 160 nonprofits.

 
“History-making moments – both on and off the course – are what this tournament is known for, and as a PGA TOUR designated event, the 2023 Travelers Championship certainly lived up to that reputation,”

 
said Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Travelers. “Our champion, Keegan Bradley, put on an impressive performance against the best player field in tournament history and in front of one of the largest crowds to line the 18th green. That level of excitement keeps fans and players coming back, helping us make important contributions to worthy causes and the local economy. Thank you to everyone who came out to the course and contributed to a record amount for charity, adding to the tens of millions of dollars generated for more than 900 organizations since we became title sponsor.”
