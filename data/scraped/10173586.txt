Each year, DiversityComm, Inc. (DCI) and its six diversity magazines conduct select evaluations of the nation's Employers, Supplier Diversity Programs, Industry Leaders, Law Enforcement & Government Agencies and Schools. The evaluations also integrate findings by each magazine independently to identify "Best of the Best" in relation to outreach and accessibility to the minority, veteran, female, people with disabilities and LGBTQ+ population. These non-biased studies are a valuable resource for the publication's readers, jobseekers, business owners, students, senior management, and consumers.
