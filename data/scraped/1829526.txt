			Trending:		 Turning point: The Wolverines broke a 58-58 tie with eight consecutive points to take control down the stretch. Buff of the game: Lawson Lovering. The 7-foot sophomore capped a solid stretch run to the season by going 9-for-13 with a career-high 21 points. Lovering also grabbed a team-high seven rebounds and recorded two steals. What’s next?: The offseason, as the Buffs turn the page to look ahead to 2023-24. Colorado couldn’t force stops, and Utah Valley rarely missed. That combination ended the 2022-23 season for the Buffaloes. Unable to keep pace with the hot-shooting assault of visiting Utah Valley, the CU men’s basketball team suffered an 81-69 defeat in the second round of the NIT on Sunday night at the Events Center. While the Wolverines advance to face Cincinnati in the NIT quarterfinals, a season full of dramatic highs and frustrating lows for the Buffs ends with an 18-17 mark. “Disappointing, obviously. We wanted to advance. We didn’t,” CU head coach Tad Boyle said. “Utah Valley is a good team. We knew that coming in. The proved it tonight. To me, that’s an NCAA Tournament-caliber team. They’re good. Their guards, holy cow are they good. If you want to be simplistic about this game tonight, the reality is they had Trey Woodbury, and we didn’t. He was the difference in the game. We had no answer for him.” Utah Valley lit up the Events Center the entire night, finishing with a .559 mark overall while going 9-for-17 on 3-pointers. The Wolverines had four players finish with double-figure points, but none of them did the sort of damage inflicted upon CU by Woodbury. With an array of CU defenders attempting, and failing, to slow Woodbury, the 6-foot-4 senior guard went 11-for-15 before finishing with 25 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Utah Valley’s .559 mark from the field was the third-highest posted by a CU opponent this season. “They’ve got really good players,” CU guard Ethan Wright said. “They’ve got a lot of shooters that can spread the floor. They have a tough lob threat. The kid Woodbury was killing us, making shots. They have a really dynamic offense. I thought we could’ve done a lot better on offense, but credit to them. They’re a good team.” The first half alone featured 10 ties and eight lead changes, with the teams playing to a 38-38 tie at the break. The game remained tied at 58-58 after a putback basket by CU’s Lawson Lovering with about 8:45 remaining, but Woodbury scored five points in an 8-0 Utah Valley run that put the Wolverines in control. Lovering finished 9-for-13 with a career-high 21 points while also adding seven rebounds. Wright hit four 3-pointers and finished with 17 points, but after shooting .548 as a team in the first half (17-for-31), the Buffs cooled off to a .387 mark in the second half. CU also finished just 4-for-19 on 3-pointers, with every player not named Wright combining to go 0-for-11. A win would’ve allowed the Buffs to play at home one more time with a berth in the NIT Final Four on the line. Yet in a season that featured one of the most impressive nonconference wins by the entire Pac-12 Conference (CU’s win against Tennessee, now in the Sweet 16, in Nashville on Nov. 11) along with one of the ugliest losses in Boyle’s 13 seasons in Boulder (a defeat in Berkeley on Dec. 31 against a California team that finished with three wins), ending in disappointment seemed fitting. “We just couldn’t ever string together stops,” Boyle said. “Teams that advance this time of year are the teams that guard. That’s the bottom line. I don’t care if you’re in the NIT or the NCAA Tournament. We’ve got a lot of work to do.” Utah Valley (27-8) Fuller 2-3 0-0 4, Bandaogo 6-9 0-0 12, Harmon 7-11 2-2 18, Woodbury 11-15 3-4 25, Darthard 4-11 4-4 13, Nield 0-2 0-0 0, Small 1-3 0-0 3, Potter 2-5 0-0 6.
