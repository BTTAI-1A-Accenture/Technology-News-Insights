 Today Riot Games revealed the new music track associated with Gekki, the new Agent that will debut in Valorant next week.Â  The new track is titled "Greater than One" which is a reference to Gekko's pets namedÂ Dizzy, Wingman, Thrash, and Mosh. It's performed byÂ ericdoa.Â  The Los Angeles native Gekko was officially revealed yesterday with a new trailer providing a look at his daily life alongside his friends until things take a mysterious turn when he secretly meetsÂ Reyna.Â  You can check out the music in the video below.  Gekko will be released as part of Act IIÂ of Episode 6, which is supposed to release on March 7. It's likely that we'll see more about him before the update launches, including his gameplay, which will certainly be interesting due to his little friends. ValorantÂ is currently available exclusively for PC. If you want to learn more about what's coming for the game, Riot Games recentlyÂ released a developer diary videoÂ to kick off 2023 providing some interesting developer commentary.Â  Recently, Riot Games made a deal with Microsoft to offer some perks to Game Pass members, includingÂ all current Agents, Day-one access to every new Agent as they're released, and 20% Match XP Boost applied to Battlepass, Event Pass, and active Agent Contract progress. That being said, this applies only to PC, and at the moment there has been no word about any release of the game on Xbox.Â  Have a tip, or want to point out something we missed?
