Impact of Covid-19 on Advanced Wound Care Market-
The Covid-19 pandemic negatively affected the market due to countrywide lockdown and canceled or postponed elective surgeries. Moreover, the prolonged lockdown disrupted the supply chain and increased the prices of medical equipment and raw materials.

There have been several key developments in the advanced wound care market in recent years. Here are some examples:
Technological advancements: The industry has seen significant advancements in wound care technology, such as the development of smart bandages that can monitor the healing process and provide real-time feedback to clinicians.
Increased focus on patient-centered care: There has been a greater emphasis on patient-centered care in the wound care industry, with more attention being paid to patient preferences and comfort. For example, companies are developing products that are more comfortable to wear and easier to use for patients.
Growing demand for bioactive wound dressings: Bioactive wound dressings that promote healing and prevent infection have become increasingly popular in the advanced wound care market. These dressings contain substances such as silver, honey, or collagen, which have antimicrobial properties.
Growth of the regenerative medicine market: The regenerative medicine market, which includes skin substitutes and other tissue-engineered products, has seen significant growth in recent years. These products are designed to promote the growth of new tissue and accelerate the healing process.
Rising adoption of negative pressure wound therapy: Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a popular treatment method for chronic and complex wounds. NPWT involves the application of negative pressure to the wound, which helps to reduce swelling and promote healing.
