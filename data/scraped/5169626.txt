 Founded in 1933 by a group of U.S. Navy Department employees, Navy Federal has grown to include service members from all branches of the U.S. military and their family members. With a Navy Federal auto loan, you can borrow from $250 to $500,000. Repayment terms for new car loans range from 12 to 96 months while used car loan terms range from 12 to 72 months.

To be eligible for membership, you—or one of your family members—must have ties to the U.S. military, Department of Defense or National Guard. Read Our Full Review On Consumers Credit Union’s Website On Fiona.com’s Website On Fiona.com’s Website On Fiona.com’s Website Read Our Full Review On Consumers Credit Union’s Website On Fiona.com’s Website On Fiona.com’s Website On Fiona.com’s Website During your research, consider these factors when comparing auto loan rates: Interest rates vary depending on your credit score. The best rates are typically reserved for highly qualified applicants; applicants with damaged credit receive higher rates. A good interest rate for a car loan, though, is one that allows you to finance a car with manageable monthly payments for your budget. Because your credit score significantly impacts your interest rate, it should be factored into your loan decision. Here are the average auto loan rates based on user credit score: The best way to get a low interest rate on an auto loan is by doing your research and preparing ahead of time to set yourself up for success. Here are some general steps to follow: Before you seek out an auto loan, consider the advantages and disadvantages of taking out an auto loan before making a purchase. Auto loans are available via several sources. Some lenders may better suit your financial situation, so carefully consider each option: Each lender will provide you with a potential interest rate based on your credit profile and qualifications. You may also need to pay lender fees. As such, it’s crucial to shop around and consider multiple lenders to find the best rate.  Your credit score directly impacts the rates you receive from lenders. For instance, applicants with higher credit scores typically land lower interest rates. The length of your loan term also determines your monthly payment amount. Longer terms stretch your debt out, causing lower monthly payments but more interest over time. Short terms require you to pay more monthly, allowing you to repay the loan faster; however, you pay less interest overall. You can evaluate multiple loan options using online consumer marketplaces or loan comparison sites. You can also pre-qualify directly with lenders online to view your rate and terms before applying. To pre-qualify, lenders typically perform a soft credit check, which does not affect your credit score. Follow these general steps to apply for an auto loan: 
 We reviewed 16 popular auto loan lenders based on 16 data points in the categories of loan details, loan costs, eligibility and accessibility, customer experience and the application process. We chose the best lenders based on the weighting assigned to each category: Within each major category, we also considered several characteristics, including available loan amounts, repayment terms, APR ranges, applicable fees and available discounts. We also looked at minimum credit score requirements, maximum accepted mileages, whether each lender accepts co-signers or co-borrowers and the geographic availability of the lender. Finally, we evaluated each provider’s customer support tools, borrower perks and features that simplify the borrowing process—like online application options, mobile apps and turnaround time. Where appropriate, we awarded partial points depending on how well a lender met each criterion. Note that these rankings only comprise lenders that offer direct lending to consumers; companies that partner with multiple lenders or offer a lending marketplace were not included. To learn more about how Forbes Advisor rates lenders, and our editorial process, check out our Loans Rating & Review Methodology. While car loans usually have fixed interest rates and loan terms, they can sometimes be negotiated, depending on your lender and the terms. Some things you can do to offset your rate include: Minimum credit score requirements vary by lender; there is no industry standard. However, we recommend a score of at least 670 to get a good interest rate. If you want to secure the lowest rates possible, aim for a score of at least 720. Zero percent financing deals are generally reserved for highly qualified applicants. Plus, they generally restrict the borrower to a shorter term, which means higher monthly payments. You’ll have to decide which is more important: a lower monthly payment or a lower overall loan cost. The best time to buy a car varies. The new year in the auto industry kicks off in October, which means dealers need to get the old models off the lots, so buyers may find incentives and discounts then. However, as dealers wrap up month-end, quarterly-end and year-end sales objectives in December, buyers may find pricing, financing and cash-back incentives at the end of the calendar year. Several online lenders, banks and dealerships offer financing options for borrowers with bad credit. Before you apply, check your credit score and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and determine your down payment amount. If you need help qualifying, consider applying with a co-signer, such as a trusted friend or family member, who becomes responsible for repaying the debt if you default. Auto loans typically require monthly payments over three to eight years, depending on your specific loan. The average auto loan term is 68.6 months, and the average monthly payment is over $700, according to recent data from Credit.com. However, you can make larger payments or pay multiple times per month to pay off your loan faster. If you plan on paying your loan off early, be sure to confirm if your lender charges prepayment penalty fees.  Ashley is a deputy editor of Education at Forbes Advisor.
