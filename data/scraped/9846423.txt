PROVIDENCE â€“ A 22-year-old Providence man wanted in the shooting death of a local man was captured Wednesday in Ohio, according to Providence police. U.S. marshals tracked Mayobanex Martinez-Abreu as he made his way westward through New York and captured him in a hotel in Youngstown, said Providence police Maj. David Lapatin. An investigation led by Providence police Lt. Dennis O'Brien had identified Martinez-Abreu as a suspect in the homicide of 28-year-old Michael Luciano De La Rosa on Monday night. Luciano De La Rosa was fatally shot in a building at 150 Waverly St. at about 8 p.m. Monday. Detectives knocked on doors and were able to identify Martinez-Abreu as a suspect, Lapatin said, adding that investigators believe the two men knew each other and had an argument inside the small building. The argument became an altercation involving a gun, he said, adding that investigators still have lots of issues to sort out. Lapatin said several people were in the building at the time of the shooting. O'Brien said two detectives were headed to Ohio on Wednesday to speak with Martinez-Abreu. They will process a black Honda Accord, he said. Martinez-Abreu hadn't yet appeared in court, said O'Brien. The timeline for his movement to Rhode Island will hinge on whether he exercises his rights under extradition laws, said O'Brien.
