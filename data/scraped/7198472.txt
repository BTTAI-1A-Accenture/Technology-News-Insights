     Fox News host Jesse Watters breaks down the questionable Biden family business dealings on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' Fox News host Jesse Watters breaks down the Biden family’s alleged business transactions on "Jesse Watters Primetime."  JESSE WATTERS: The full transcript of Biden's former business partner, Devon Archer, has just been released — and it confirms everything that Joe Biden and the media have been lying to you about. Archer testified not only did Joe Biden know about his son's foreign business, but Vice President Joe Biden said at elegant dinners that lasted hours with his son’s foreign clients, and he knew exactly who they were.  According to Archer, Joe would enter the room and shake everybody's hand. They weren't going to him. Joe Biden was coming to them. One of these dinners, Archer says, was a birthday dinner at Cafe Milano in Georgetown in the spring of 2014. Now, we checked. Neither Joe, Hunter or Archer have birthdays in the spring. So, why was the vice president attending one of his son's dirty foreign client's birthday dinners?  HUNTER GAVE BIDEN 'GREEN LIGHT' TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS CHILD TO 'NEGATE A REPUBLICAN LINE OF ATTACK,' SOURCES SAY  Well, according to Archer, the guest list for the birthday dinner included Russian billionaires, friends of Putin, a Burisma executive and a Kazakhstani businessman… CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Archer says after the birthday dinner, one of the Kazakhstanis wired Hunter $142,000. It was wired through a bank that was later shut down for helping North Korea buy ballistic missiles. On the wiring instructions from the dirty bank, the reason for the wire, the Kazakhstani wrote this: "For car." Hunter took the $142,000 and wired it to a car dealership in Jersey where he bought a brand-new Porsche Panamera. See how this works? Hunter brings Daddy to the dinner with clients and drives off in a Porsche.   For more Culture, Media, Education, Opinion, and channel coverage, visit foxnews.com/media.  This article was written by Fox News staff.
