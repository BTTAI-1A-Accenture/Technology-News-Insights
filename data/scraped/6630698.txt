PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 9, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Allied Market Research published a report, titled, "Semiconductor Foundry Market by Node Type and Application: Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2023–2032". According to the report, the global semiconductor foundry market was valued at $106.9 billion in 2022, and is projected to reach $231.5 billion by 2032, registering a CAGR of 8.1% from 2023 to 2032. Download Research Report Sample & TOC:https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/125371 A semiconductor foundry, commonly referred to as a 'foundry,' is a specialized facility dedicated to the manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs) or microchips. Unlike integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) that oversee both chip design and production, foundries focus solely on the production process. They provide a vital service to companies and designers who may lack the required resources or infrastructure to produce semiconductors independently. Typically, foundries operate under contractual arrangements, producing chips according to the specifications and designs provided by their clients, who are often referred to as fabless semiconductor companies. Prime Determinants of Growth   The semiconductor foundry market analysis is expected to expand significantly during the forecast period owing to increase in utilization of consumer electronics, and surge in internet of things (IoT) technology. On the contrary, the complexities in manufacturing associated with semiconductor foundry restrains the market growth during the forecast period. In addition, the semiconductor foundry market is anticipated to benefit from increase in investments in semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and materials, during the forecast period.  Report Coverage & Details:  Report Coverage  Details  Forecast Period  2023–2032  Base Year  2022 Market Size in 2022  $106.9 billion  Market Size in 2032  $231.5 billion  CAGR  8.1 % No. of Pages in Report  289 Segments covered  Node Size, Application, and Region.
