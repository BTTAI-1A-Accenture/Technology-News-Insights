Textron Aviation announced that Aerus, a new regional airline in Mexico, is launching its fleet with the purchase of two 19 passenger configured Cessna SkyCourier twin-engine turboprops and four Cessna Grand Caravan EX turboprops. The airline recently took delivery of the first three Grand Caravan EX aircraft. The Cessna SkyCourier and Cessna Grand Caravan EX are designed and manufactured by Textron Aviation Inc., a Textron Inc. company. "A fleet of Cessna SkyCouriers and Cessna Grand Caravans will enable Aerus to be successful in growing service range and frequency of flights," said Marcelo Moreira, vice president of Sales, Latin America region, Textron Aviation. "Both aircraft offer superior performance and low operating costs in combination with flexibility in cabin and payload." The Cessna SkyCourier and Grand Caravan EX aircraft are versatile and reliable business tools that enable customers like Aerus to fulfill their missions. Based in Monterrey, Mexico, Aerus will cover unserved national and international routes in order to meet the needs of its customers. “When we looked at options within the market to operate the routes we had in mind, it was a no-brainer decision to choose the Grand Caravan EX and the SkyCourier from Textron Aviation, which will be the cornerstone of the Aerus project,” said Javier Herrera, CEO, Aerus. “We are very proud to be one of the first operators of the new SkyCourier, which we are sure will be a great success for Textron Aviation and Aerus. We appreciate Textron Aviation's support as we set launch operations.” Aerus is part of Grupo Herrera, which has 80 years of experience in the automotive, financial, and real estate industries, and has had an air taxi permit since 1990. The company plans to begin its airline operations in the first quarter of 2023.
