These are some of the most common car insurance coverages. Requirements and offerings may vary by state.‡ Required Protects you if you cause an accident Liability coverage is required for all drivers in most states. It pays for property damage and injuries you cause to others if you're found responsible for a car accident. It can also cover related legal expenses. Example: You cause an accident with another car. The other driver's knee is hurt from the impact and their car is damaged in the accident. Your liability coverage can pay for their related medical care and car repairs up to your policy's liability limits. Recommended Protects your car from the unexpected Often purchased together if you have a new car or high-value vehicle, comprehensive coverage and collision coverage protect you financially from unexpected damage to your car. State law doesn't require them, but your car lease or loan probably does. Example: If your car is stolen or damaged by a non-collision event (including hitting an animal, fire, hail damage, other acts of nature, vandalism, and theft), comprehensive can cover your car repairs. Example: If your car is damaged in an accident, collision can cover your car repairs regardless of who's at fault. Pays for towing services and more Our roadside assistance covers towing services if your car breaks down, as well as flat tire changes, fuel delivery, lock-out services, and more. Example: Your car breaks down and you need to get it to a repair shop. We'll arrange to tow your car anywhere in a 15-mile radius or to the nearest shop. Protects you from drivers who can't pay for damages Required in some states, uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage can pay for your injuries if you're hit by a driver with too little or no car insurance. UM/UIM can offer peace of mind in case you're in an accident caused by someone without enough liability coverage to cover your injuries and damages. Example: You're rear-ended by a driver who doesn't have car insurance. UM/UIM can cover your medical bills and car repairs up to your limits. Car insurance, specifically liability coverage, is required in nearly every state to protect you financially in case you cause injuries or property damage to someone. With additional coverages, your auto insurance can also help pay to repair or replace your own vehicle.
