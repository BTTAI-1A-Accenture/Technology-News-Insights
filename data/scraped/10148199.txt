This collaboration enables users to seamlessly book and pay for taxi services directly through the Helbiz app and is now available in the major cities of Milan, Rome, Naples, and Turin.

  
WeTaxi, amongst Italyâ€™s leading taxi providers with access to over 25% of the national fleet, is anticipated to capture half of the market within the next two years. The company currently operates in 20 Italian cities, including the four cities where the service has been launched.

Salvatore Palella, CEO and Founder of micromobility.com Inc., commented on the partnership, "The collaboration with WeTaxi not only expands our service offerings and customer reach, but also establishes a new revenue stream for our company. By incorporating taxi services into our comprehensive ecosystem in cities such as Milan, Rome, Naples, and Turin, Helbiz users gain access to a wide range of services, including micro-mobility, food delivery, and insurance policies, all within a single app. We are eager to embark on this venture in Italy and look forward to exploring similar opportunities in the United States."

 
The partnership with WeTaxi enables the company to engage with a younger demographic who may not have previously used their services. Massimiliano Curto, CEO of WeTaxi, stated, "This strategic partnership allows us to offer a transparent, secure, and user-friendly service to a younger audience, providing them with the convenience of booking and paying for taxis directly from their smartphones."
