     Safety and security are everyone's number one priority. Cyberguy lists some of the best tech to keep you safe at home or on the go. You see it on the news. You can feel it on the streets. There is no doubt there's a sense that it's less safe to go out in many cities without taking some extra precautions. More Americans are engaging in activities outside the home and there is no better time to invest in tech to protect your safety while you are out and about in public places. CLICK TO GET KURT’S CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER I'm constantly thinking about a parking space close to my destination to avoid any sketchy behavior. I don't walk as much after dinner in the neighborhood when we used to enjoy a stroll.  While traditional personal protection gear such as mace and pepper spray have been popular in the past, they are illegal in certain states and difficult to get through airport security. Additionally, carrying a defensive device that can be used as a weapon can create more danger, especially if it falls into the wrong hands. As important as it is to keep safe, it's equally important that protective tech is portable and easily integrated into one's life so it can be readily on hand. The following is a list of safety tech gear that is both discreet and safe. A She's Birdie keychain that emits an alarm and strobe light when activated. (She's Birdie) Birdie is a lightweight keychain accessory (about the size of a key fob but lighter) that emits a loud alarm and flashes a bright, strobe light to deter attackers. The device is easy to activate when needed as it works by merely pulling off/yanking the bottom portion of the design. AMAZON PRIME MEMBERS FORCED TO PAY MORE FOR FREE GROCERY DELIVERY At the time of publishing, She’s Birdie had over 7,700 global ratings with 77% of consumers giving it 5 stars. Cost at time of publishing: $29.95 Get she's birdie Sabre Door and Window Alarms for use in a car or hotel room. (Sabre) These standalone home alarms can be taken on a trip for a vacation rental, hotel room and a dorm. Dirt cheap and simple to install, what I love about these Sabre Door and Window Alarms is they are super loud and can be heard up to a thousand feet away. When not armed to alert to an intruder, you can set it to chime if a door or window is opened during the day. This has got to be the easiest do-it-yourself personal safety door and window alarms with absolutely no wiring or central system to worry about getting hacked. Pop one out of the box with the self-adhesive pads and it will be operational in seconds. HOW A HIGH-TECH TOILET CAN KEEP YOU FROM OVERSPENDING ON ROLLS OF TOILET PAPER Cost at time of publishing: $30.44 Get the Sabre Door and Window Alarm Kit GearLight Tactical Flashlights to help in dark places or to attract attention when lost. (Fox News) Often used by police and military, tactical flashlights are typically used in conjunction with firearms for low-light identification. Where this type of product can benefit the average citizen is that it is so bright that it can stop the approach of suspicious people coming toward you as well as attract attention to your location to others. Incredibly well constructed, if the situation escalates and the suspicious individual gets close enough, the tactical flashlight can be used as a blunt weapon if necessary. HOW TO SPEED UP YOUR WIFI, INTERNET CONNECTIONS At the time of publishing, the GearLight LED Flashlight 2 pack had over 70,000 global ratings with 77% of consumers giving it 5 stars.

(Fox News) Get Flare is a personal safety device that comes as two types of bracelets, a cuff or stone. There are many types of stones or finishes to choose from so you can find a version of the device that suits your tastes. They are specifically designed to be discreet so that they are not jeopardized (or grabbed first) in a potentially dangerous situation. There are buttons on the underside of the bracelet that when pressed can get you help as it is connected to an app on your phone via Bluetooth.  In addition to being able to text your GPS location to a pre-selected group of contacts or connecting to 911 if desired, Get Flare uniquely has the ability to have a pre-recorded call come through your phone with a push of a button so that it can deescalate a potentially hazardous situation with a fake call.
