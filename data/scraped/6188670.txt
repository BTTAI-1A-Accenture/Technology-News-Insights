- Google’s annual conference, also referred to as Google I/O 2023 was held last May 10. From Magic Editor to MusicLM, the tech giant didn’t hold back and seemed to focus on AI. In line with that, CEO Sundar Pichai has announced that an AI-powered tool called “Help Me Write” will be available on Gmail. This will be a relief for those who find writing or responding to emails a chore. As the name suggests, “Help Me Write” is a Workspace tool to help users write new messages or reply to one. It is considered an upgrade from Smart Reply, which generates short responses with a click, and Smart Compose, which suggests response as you type. These AI-powered tools have been used over 180 billion times in the past year alone. And now, with a much more powerful generative model, we’re taking the next step with “Help me write” in Gmail. “Help me write” is rolling out soon as part of our Workspace updates. #GoogleIO — Google (@Google) May 10, 2023  If you have access to the Help Me Write feature, it is easy to try out this new tool. Users can use a recreate option to generate another message if they are not satisfied with the initial result.

This includes having that fear of being replaced by AI. Google, however, have shown how they intend to integrate AI with the current workforce. This will result in collaboration and, if responsibly taken advantage of, increase productivity. Help Me Write is just another tool that proves just that. With daily tasks piling up and deadlines to meet, composing and replying to emails may seem time-consuming. AI-generated texts, with the option to edit and choose better responses, can ease each worker’s woes. It will also help employees focus on the more daunting part of their jobs. At the moment, Google’s Help Me Write feature is currently available to selected users. Photo credit: The feature image is symbolic and has been provided by Google for press purposes.
