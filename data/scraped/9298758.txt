 News provided by 11 Oct, 2023, 21:01 GMT Share this article The leptomeningeal metastases market is expected to grow significantly owing to an increasing incident population, less competitive scenarios, novel treatment options, the development of new diagnostic approaches, and new treatment methods focusing on particular tumor types. LAS VEGAS, Oct. 11, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- DelveInsight's Leptomeningeal Metastases Market Insights report includes a comprehensive understanding of current treatment practices, leptomeningeal metastases emerging drugs, market share of individual therapies, and current and forecasted market size from 2019 to 2032, segmented into 7MM [the United States, the EU-4 (Italy, Spain, France, and Germany), the United Kingdom, and Japan]. Key Takeaways from the Leptomeningeal Metastases Market Report Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major leptomeningeal metastases market share @ Leptomeningeal Metastases Market Report Leptomeningeal Metastases Overview Leptomeningeal metastases, also known as carcinomatous meningitis and neoplastic meningitis, refers to the dissemination of cancerous cells into the cerebrospinal fluid space. These cells can originate from primary tumors within the central nervous system, such as drop metastases, or from distant tumors that have spread through the bloodstream. Although any type of cancer can lead to leptomeningeal metastases, it is most commonly associated with advanced stages of lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and gastrointestinal cancers. The symptoms of leptomeningeal metastases can vary widely and often manifest as a range of neurological issues. Doctors use the term "multifocal deficits" to describe the diverse array of symptoms that may present. For instance, a person may exhibit signs of encephalopathy and radiculopathy simultaneously. Diagnostic tests for leptomeningeal metastases typically encompass cerebral spinal fluid cytology, lumbar puncture, and magnetic resonance imaging. Leptomeningeal Metastases Epidemiology Segmentation As per the DelveInsight estimates, in 2021, the total diagnosed cases of leptomeningeal Mmetastases were ~303.8 thousand cases in the 7MM, which are expected to grow during the study period, i.e. 2019–2032. The leptomeningeal metastases market report proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2019–2032 in the 7MM segmented into: Leptomeningeal Metastases Treatment Market  Treatment objectives encompass alleviating neurological symptoms and, when feasible, enhancing or maintaining the patient's neurological function while extending their survival. Given the significant variance in prognosis based on the primary tumor type and the extent of both neurological and systemic involvement, it is valuable to identify parameters that can distinguish patients with a poor prognosis from those with a favorable prognosis. This distinction guides the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for each individual. Patients with extensive leptomeningeal metastasis infiltration in the brain, causing fixed neurological deficits or encephalopathy, along with uncontrolled systemic disease and limited treatment options, face a grim prognosis despite LM-directed interventions. In such cases, adopting a palliative care approach should be considered. Nonetheless, regardless of the treatment plan, all leptomeningeal metastases patients require supportive care to alleviate and manage neurological symptoms and signs associated with leptomeningeal metastases, whenever possible. In cases of leptomeningeal metastasis, the primary surgical approach involves ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) to address symptomatic hydrocephalus. Additionally, the placement of a ventricular access device, such as an Ommaya or Rickham reservoir, is considered to facilitate the administration of intra-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemotherapy. In situations requiring both a VPS and an Ommaya ventricular access device, an on-off valve may be installed. However, this necessitates that the patient can tolerate the VPS being temporarily turned off to allow for the administration of drugs into the ventricles, allowing time for distribution into the non-ventricular CSF compartments. Complications associated with VPS include the potential for tumor dissemination into the peritoneal cavity, device failure, and the risk of infection.

Researchers are currently exploring advanced diagnostic methods to identify DNA signatures for more precise patient diagnoses. Pioneering treatment strategies are also under development, involving the direct intra-CSF injection of chemotherapy drugs to breach the blood–CSF barrier. This breakthrough could have a significant impact on leptomeningeal metastases patient treatment. With no approved treatments currently available for the disease, this presents an ideal opportunity for companies to investigate unmet needs and create therapeutic options that will improve the lives of these patients and capitalize on this rare medical condition. However, several factors may impede the growth of the leptomeningeal metastases market. With no currently approved therapies and a dearth of promising drugs in the developmental pipeline to halt leptomeningeal metastases progression, the situation calls for immediate attention. The absence of a universally accepted diagnostic gold standard for leptomeningeal metastases heightens the risk of false-negative test results. Leptomeningeal metastases is diagnosed in only around 5% of metastatic cancer cases, leaving a larger portion undiagnosed or with asymptomatic involvement. Timely identification and treatment are vital, as leptomeningeal metastases can swiftly progress, resulting in patient mortality.
