			Trending:		 EL SEGUNDO — If there were any questions about who the Lakers’ starting point guard would be entering the 2023-24 season, Coach Darvin Ham swiftly made it clear that it will be D’Angelo Russell.It was a strong affirmation of confidence in Russell after the way last season ended, and the Lakers signing Gabe Vincent – the Miami Heat’s starting point guard during their run to the NBA Finals – as a free agent during the offseason.“A lot was made about the way things finished against Denver and whatnot. At the end of the day, we don’t get to where we got to without D’Angelo Russell,” Ham said Thursday. “He’s our starting point guard. I’m going to encourage him to be assertive – he’s a highly intelligent basketball player who’s coming back with a chip on his shoulder.”“He chose us, we believe in him and he’s one of those guys who has a ton of pride and passion about not only his individual performance but those of his teammates as well. He’s another one who’s going to have an outstanding season.”Russell, who is returning to the Lakers on a two-year, $36 million contract (team option on the second season) he signed as a free agent over the summer, was the team’s starting point guard for the 17 regular-season games he was available after the Lakers acquired him ahead of the Feb. 9 trade deadline.He remained the team’s lead guard in the playoffs, but his playing time and production dipped significantly during the Western Conference finals, when the Lakers were swept 4-0 by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets.Russell came off the bench for the first time and played a postseason-low 15 minutes in the series-deciding Game 4 loss to Denver.“I remember Darvin and I sitting in our exit meeting with D’Angelo and it was coming off the emotional Western Conference finals, you lose to the champions and he didn’t get a chance to play as much in that series,” General Manager Rob Pelinka said. “We said listen ‘from the time the trade happened until the end of the Denver series, let’s look at it as a great honeymoon.’ You can go on a honeymoon with your significant other and you can have 13 incredible days, perfect days. And then lunch on the 14th day isn’t as good as you want it to be, it doesn’t mean it wasn’t an incredible trip.

“We want to keep the bigger picture with him of … he impacted our season in a huge way. He’s been a vocal leader on the court and kind of the workouts are going on with his teammates. It looks like he was very intentional too with taking care of his body and adding a little bit of shoulder strength. D’Angelo’s in a really good headspace.”Russell being solidified as the team’s starting point guard cemented the Lakers’ starting backcourt, with Ham also saying third-year guard Austin Reaves will be the team’s starting shooting guard.Reaves, who is returning to the Lakers on a four-year, $53.8 million deal, is coming off a breakout season in which he was the team’s starting shooting guard to close out the regular season and in the playoffs.“Oh man, I could not be more proud of that kid, man,” added Ham, who said earlier in the offseason that he believes Reaves will be an All-Star at some point in his career. “He’s fearless. I believe every word that I’ve mentioned and said about him. Just his humbleness, and a low-key guy, fun to be around, a worker who absolutely loves to hoop.”Reaves spent a significant chunk of the offseason with Team USA for the FIBA World Cup in the Philippines, averaging 13.8 points (57% shooting), 2.8 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.3 steals in 21.7 minutes (eight games).He led all bench players in scoring in the event, where the Americans finished in fourth place.“Austin’s growth isn’t a surprise to any of us,” Pelinka said. “He uniquely has that sort of ‘Mamba gene’, where it’s all about the work, it’s about playing competitive on every play, it’s about being a great teammate, not caring about the personal accolades but just the team winning. He exemplifies that, and his growth with Team USA, we’re proud of him, but certainly not a surprise.”Related Articles
