The PGA Tour swings through Minnesota this week, where the 3M Open is offering a purse of $7.8 million, with $1.404 million to the winner. It's also offering something many players in this week's field desperately covet: FedEx Cup playoff points. Lee Hodges became a first-time Tour winner at TPC Twin Cities in a seven-shot romp, cashing his biggest check and putting himself in position for more loot by getting inside the top 70 in the FedEx Cup standings. With a triple bogey at the 72nd hole, J.T. Poston fell from a solo second spot to a tie for second. It cost him $260,000. Here's the prize-money breakdown for the 2023 3M Open. WIN.
