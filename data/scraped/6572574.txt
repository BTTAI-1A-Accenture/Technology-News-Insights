E-taxi app inDrive has launched InCode 2023, an annual global hackathon that seeks to improve safety and inclusivity in ride-hailing.  Top ideas will be awarded €16,000 (KES 2.3 million), and participants can register teams of 1 to 6 individuals. The entries will be assessed based on feasibility, code quality, UX/UI quality, idea, and impact by inDrive professionals. InCode hackathon aims to improve safety, advance accessibility, and propose innovative solutions to enhance inner and inter-city trips and delivery of goods through technology. The hackathon consists of two phases.  Alexander Lobashev, Senior VP of Engineering at inDrive, stated that inCode acknowledges the creative software developers and coders who have played a crucial role in the existence of ride-hailing platforms. The goal of inCode is to identify innovative tech solutions that can enhance safety, inclusivity, and user experience in ride-hailing. “Ride-hailing platforms owe their very existence to the creativity and technical expertise of software developers and coders’ ability to dream up, design, and build global products, reliable algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces. InCode is a way for inDrive to recognize the tech innovators who invest their time and talent to make ride-hailing safer, more inclusive, and better to use. We at inDrive are excited to see what ideas emerge from our first annual hackathon,” he said. More details can be found here.
