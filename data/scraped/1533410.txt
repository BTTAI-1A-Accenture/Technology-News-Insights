Investopedia / Michela Buttignol  Principal investing is when financial institutions, private equity firms, or other such enterprises put their own capital or balance sheet at risk in anticipation of future profit. This differs from when they act as intermediaries or brokers investing on behalf of their clients.
  Principal investing is when firms or individuals invest their capital directly into businesses, projects, or ventures rather than investing on behalf of their clients. The principal investor owns the securities or assets and stands to gain all potential profits from their stake while taking on all the risk and potential losses.
  This type of investing is common among private equity and venture capital firms. They typically acquire significant stakes in businesses to influence the direction of those companies and increase their value.
  Principal investing can target various industries and asset classes, from real estate to technology startups. The investments can include buying stocks, bonds, commodities, and real estate properties or funding startups.
  Principal investors often target the infrastructure sector because of its potential for stable, long-term returns. Projects may include utilities, transportation systems, or renewable energy initiatives. Another popular choice for principal investments is the real estate industry.
  Commercial real estate, in particular, can offer attractive investment opportunities with the potential for significant returns from rental income and property appreciation. Successful principal investing can also be seen in the asset management industry. Here, diversification is key, with portfolios often containing a varied mixture of stocks, bonds, and other assets to balance risk and reward.
  The main goal of principal investing is to achieve a significant return on investment through capital appreciation, an increase in the value of the investment, or income generation from dividends and interest.
  Principal investing offers potential benefits but also is a significant risk for any firm. It’s an approach best suited for those willing to take on higher risk for the potential of higher returns, who have the resources to take on this risk, and who have the expertise to actively manage the investments involved.
  Thus, while principal investing can offer high rewards and greater control over investments, it also carries strong risks. Therefore, it requires careful planning, thorough research, and often a long-term commitment.
  Principal investing involves strategies that optimize the balance between risk and reward. Diversification across various asset classes is a common approach, helping to shield the principal while potentially yielding returns. This can involve a mix of growth investments and income-producing assets. Asset allocation strategies may be used to adjust the proportion of different types of investments in response to changes in market conditions and investment goals.
  Some investors may opt for principal-protected instruments like zero-coupon bonds or use strategies like bond swapping and event-driven investing. Each strategy carries potential risks and rewards and should be chosen based on the investor’s financial goals and risk tolerance.
  Real-life examples of successful principal investing have involved strategic asset allocation, insight into a changing market, and careful risk management.
  Here are some well-known examples of principal investing:
 A principal investor can be an individual, but most often, it’s firms that choose to invest their capital in businesses for a potentially significant financial return. A well-known example is Carl Icahn, who has taken significant stakes in companies to influence their strategic direction, including TWA, Herbalife, and Netflix—the last being a counter to his long-held claim to invest in stock “no one wants.” In finance, principal generally refers to the original capital lent or invested before income or returns are considered. The principal amount also often serves as the basis for calculating returns or interest. Principal investing generally involves using a firm’s capital for direct investments. Private equity often uses pooled funds from various investors to acquire company stakes. Though principal investing is more commonly associated with institutional investors and individuals with a high net worth, the core idea of investing your own money directly into assets can technically be applied at any scale. Thus, even small-scale investors are involved in principal investing when buying company shares, real estate, or other assets. That said, it takes a significant amount of capital to invest in larger firms to influence their strategic direction.  Principal investing involves an individual or firm using its own funds to finance transactions or acquire assets rather than raising capital from investors. This strategy allows the firm to control transactions directly and with the potential of earning higher returns.
  However, principal investing does come with increased risk, as the firm’s capital is directly at stake. It requires astute risk assessment and strategic decision making—otherwise, the risk to the firm multiplies.
