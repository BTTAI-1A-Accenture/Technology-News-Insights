One of the main reasons for the S&P 500’s drop in 2022 was the increase in interest rates to fight inflation. However, it’s equally crucial to understand that equities rise more frequently than they fall and they usually don’t decline two years in a row. The S&P 500 increased by 4% so far in 2023. When interest rates are low and the economy is growing, growth stocks tend to perform well. They outperformed value stocks and the S&P 500 significantly from the end of the global financial crisis until recently. However, the era of low-interest rates and increasing stock prices has come to an end. As a consequence, growth stocks suffered losses in 2022, with the S&P 500 growth index dropping around 30.1%, compared to a 7.4% decline in the value index (.IVX).  Among the greatest losers in the S&P 500 growth index (.IGX), down between 28% and 66% in 2022, are Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Investors have turned away from growth equities and towards value stocks due to rising interest rates. The previously exorbitant values of growth companies have decreased, creating excellent buying opportunities for long-term investors who are willing to seize them. In 2023, growth stocks have been the go-to investment, with many of them experiencing significant gains since the start of the year. These stocks are popular among investors due to their impressive returns and exceptional financial growth, which often place them in rapidly expanding sectors such as technology, e-commerce, and biotechnology. As a result, growth companies have the potential to generate substantial profits, with certain stocks showing particular promise. To capitalize on this opportunity, here are ten growth stocks that are currently hot and worth considering for purchase. Our Methodology Keeping all these points in mind, let’s start our list of the 10 hot growth stocks to buy now. For this article, we have picked the stocks with at least a 20% revenue growth rate over the last 12 months and sorted them by their 3 month returns. In addition, we have excluded companies smaller than $500 million in market cap and $2 million in daily trading volume.

In addition, the firm predicted that fiscal Q2, the first quarter of results following CEO Bob Iger’s comeback, would be crucial, with a particular focus on an update on the decline in direct-to-consumer losses. Overall, hedge funds are loading up on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), as 112 out of the 920 funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in the media giant up from 109 funds a quarter earlier.

Parks remained a bright spot while losses at direct-to-consumer increased and linear networks continued to be challenged by cord cutting.” Revenue Growth Rate over Last 12 Months: 59.65% 3 months return: 15.77% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33 Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) is one of North America’s top food and food-service distribution firms.

Net sales increased largely due to an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation and channel mix. As part of a larger research note on Restaurants resulting from the ICR Conference presentations, Truist analyst Jake Bartlett boosted his price objective on Performance Food Group Company (NYSE:PFGC) to $75 from $72 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares on January 12. According to the analyst, the conference verified that restaurant demand is still strong.

(NYSE:CRM) offers customer relationship management software that connects businesses and customers globally. With more than 150,000 users across 150,000 companies, Salesforce holds a 33% market share as the most popular CRM system. With 22%, Microsoft’s Dynamics platform is second, and Oracle completes the top three with 11%. According to data on Salesforce application development, the reason for Salesforce’s popularity is that it provides a variety of capabilities that are difficult to find in a single CRM program. Although Salesforce’s stock has been up 17.78% so far in 2023, it was still down a staggering 45% from its all-time high in November 2021.  Salesforce has witnessed an unprecedented revenue increase over the last decade, with revenue topping $26.49 billion for the fiscal year 2022, a 25% increase over the previous year’s period. In 2012, the company’s sales was $2.27 billion. Although Salesforce’s growth has slowed, the situation is not as dire as the markets have suggested. Salesforce anticipates sales to increase by 17% to around $31 billion for the fiscal year 2023, which ends on January 30. In addition, Salesforce aims for $50 billion in revenue and consistent profit expansion by the fiscal year 2026. Moreover, Elliott Management, an activist investor, just acquired a sizeable investment in Salesforce. Because other activists also have stakes in the business, they’ll all urge Salesforce to increase its profitability. At the end of Q3 2022, 117 hedge funds owned a stake in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), up from 116 in the preceding quarter. On January 30, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintained an Overweight rating on Salesforce and increased his price objective to $236 from $228, contending that the current valuation considerably underpriced future profitability potential. Oakmark Funds mentioned Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said: “Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.” Revenue Growth Rate over Last 12 Months: 50.97% 3 months return: 21.89% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58 Airbnb, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ABNB) stock is undoubtedly off to a very strong start in 2023. The company shares have offered investors more than 30.39% in returns over the past month.

It is a term I have coined to describe the type of companies I research. It is a disruptive technology that is changing the status quo of a given industry. For example, Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) with the lodging industry. This definition casts a wide net in terms of what sectors I look at, but it is very specific in terms of what type of companies I look at. I also believe focusing on these companies gives me an inherent edge over Wall St. as they are often older and disconnected from what is truly innovative (…Click here to read more).” Revenue Growth Rate over Last 12 Months: 43.61% 3 months return: 30.32% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
