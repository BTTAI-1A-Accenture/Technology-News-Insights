 The Privy Council has rejected former fugitive from justice, Nyron Erickson‚Äôs application to appeal against the governor‚Äôs order to have him extradited to the United States of America (US). Erickson faces an indictment in the USA on charges of conspiracy to launder monetary funds from outside the USA and unlawfully transporting those funds into the USA. In a February 15 decision document on Erickson‚Äôs application seen by BVI News, the Privy Council‚Äôs Judicial Committee said: ‚ÄúHaving considered an application for permission to appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (British Virgin Islands) dated 11th August 2022 in the matter of Nyron Erickson (Appellant) v United States of America (Respondent) and having considered written submissions from the parties, we have agreed to report to Your Majesty as our opinion that 1) the application for permission to appeal should be REFUSED because the appeal does not raise an arguable point of law. The Privy Council‚Äôs Judicial Committee further noted that His Majesty King Charles III was ‚Äúpleased by and with the advice of His Privy Council to approve the report and to order that those charged with administering the Government of the British Virgin Islands and all others whom it may concern are to ensure that it is punctually observed and obeyed.‚Äù This effectively means that the extradition will now move forward as planned. It is not yet clear to our news centre when the accused will be made to leave the territory.  Copyright 2024 BVI News, Media Expressions Limited. All Rights Reserved.

A.F on the other hand is another story People like you are beyond sick in the head for showing remorse for heartless k¬°||‚Ç¨rs SMH Wonderful news!!!! On the street ,that the person that was supposed to play the role of protector could not even protect himself ,( so ah guess they go link up ~ when he go up On the street ,that the person that was supposed to play the role of protector and he made it look good by using the barges , but he could not even protect himself ,( so ah guess they go link up in the states After the calamity of the repeated failures to extradite B H, it was important that this one was successful. Presumably the DPP was not involved. Have a nice time in the USA west Bank Drinks for everyone. Today was a gooooooooddddd day!! Thank you Privy Council. 10 vs life with money easy thing to do I wonder who d**k then oneal boys going ride now Thank you Jesus all the evil that he done will come back to haunt him.

Send him up to Uncle Sam as fast as ever. So we can have some calm in the bvi. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è False report the Government lost their appeal to extradite Mr. Erickson. He is a free man We$t Bank bury its money. Police need to dig up his yard $$$$$$ so when he come out he poor People stop acting like he going america to do life in prison, he‚Äôll be out in 5 to 10.. and facing a long dull life in the US prison system. But at least he‚Äôll live longer in prison instead of inevitable prey and death on Tortola from the Senegal hit men. Vincentian I Hope he is not going to P.R! Save the King #@ Trouble‚Ä¶ With all due respect he hasn‚Äôt killed anyone Having met Nyron before he turned Chief, I just feel it‚Äôs a shame he couldn‚Äôt find a way to use his brains, guts and skills to go big in the honest world. This is why the BVI is so screwed, you can millions moving drugs in a couple of years but try to use the same entrepreneurial skills in a honest way and every one slaps you down and you have to work twice as hard.
Everyone wants to moan about guns and drug running but the same establishment makes it‚Äôs so hard for these people to make a honest living. Trade don‚Äôt give licenses, Labour makes it hard to employ people and Government is slow. Surprised police didn‚Äôt confiscate $10 million dollar yard contents‚Ä¶the king is dead long live the king Ayo here using people f**king name to hide ayo comments ayo stinking mo**ersk**t Your name is Camp?
