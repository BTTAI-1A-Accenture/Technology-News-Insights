 The world of Artificial Intelligence continues to fascinate us.  We collected 7 free artificial intelligence(AI) tools, most of them easy to use and some more sophisticated… like building ML models. We did try to be unique and avoid many of the AI platforms you’ll find in most posts of Best AI Tools. Additionally, we wanted them to be free for testing, without caveats like adding your credit card number. Some of these we use ourselves (e.g., Lumen, JADBio), so it was important for us to include them as we truly value what they have to offer. The list is not extensive, but we plan to come back to the topic often. Consider this version I. GFP-GAN is a new Free AI tool that can fix most old photos instantly. GFP-GAN (Generative Facial Prior-Generative Adversarial Network) was developed by Tencent researchers by merging info from two AI models to fill in a photo’s missing details with realistic detail in a few seconds, all the while maintaining high accuracy and quality. The results are very impressive and work well even with very low-quality images. You can try a demo of GFP-GAN for free. The creators have also posted their code to let anyone implement the restoration tech in their own projects. With this one, you literally just have to “copy.” This AI-based copywriting tool generates unique content that you can post on your blog, social media, or even for a video by simply providing a short description of the topic you want content on. Copy.ai could be helpful for content creators. The tool can help a user write Instagram captions, blog posts, product descriptions, Facebook content, start-up ideas, and many more. Sign up for an account, give a description of your topic of interest, and the AI tool will generate content based on your description. Awesome tool that will be handy in the future of digital content. Note: This ^ is not the only tool that uses AI to create content. There are several out there, some better than others so we suggest you give them all a try. There’s — Microcopy for headlines, slogans, and more — Speedwrite for rewriting and enhancing any sentence — Hemingway for making your writing bold and clear — Jarvis AI is a quality AI copywriting tool, as they say plus Notion.AI that just arrived, and we’ve given it a whole paragraph below. JADBio is a user-friendly machine learning platform that needs no expertise in coding but is equipped with powerful knowledge extraction tools. Although it is purpose-built for biotech and multi-omics, you can basically upload any kind of curated data and analyze it. Very useful for students who want to dive into machine learning or people who want to build a predictive model, for example, which potato will yield the best fry (binary classification). They offer a lifetime free account, and the use is pretty straightforward. We guess you’ve heard all the hype about this one. DALLE 2 by OpenAI is a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. It can create original, realistic images and art from a text description. It can combine concepts, attributes, and styles. Worth playing around with, the website has several examples to inspire you. It’s completely free to use. Notion is testing a new feature called Notion AI to create content. All you have to do is tell the app what you want — a blog post, a recruiting email template, a list of great business books to read- and the app actually creates the content right in front of your eyes. A lot of users love Notion for note-taking, and this will definitely take it to the next level.  Lumen5 is an online video-making platform with tools that allow you to make videos effortlessly in a few steps. It includes great templates and various formats for different social media platforms. The AI comes in when you upload a transcript; it creates the whole video sequence, including images, using your imported transcript. A great and easy-to-use tool, especially if you want to create fast content for social media platforms. Lumen Technologies also offers an extensive range of images and videos to include in your final video.  Lalal uses artificial intelligence to remove vocals and conduct music source separation fast, easy, and precise stem extraction. You can remove vocal, instrumental, drums, bass, piano, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and synthesizer tracks without quality loss. Makes creativity painless! You can start playing around as it gives you 10 minutes free, but the paying models are also very reasonable. 15 euros one-time fee for 90 minutes of processing will get you far. #apps #artificialintelligence #ai #virtualreality #appdevelopment #chatgpt #openai #dalle2 #futuretechnology #robotics #contentwriting #graphicdesign #chatgpt3 #graphicdesigner #writer #storytelling #influencermarketing #digitalmarketingagency #digitalamarketing #virtualassistant #virtualreality #socialmedia #illustrator #designing #ideas #ideageneration #creativecontent #creativity #kointrack  AREA MANAGER ( AGM) - L&T Corporate Office ( AP , Telanagana & Karnataka) Ex ITW SIGNODE l VOITH  l HOWDEN Great info, Thanks alot!
