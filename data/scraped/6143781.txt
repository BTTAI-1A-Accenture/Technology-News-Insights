 Bea Alonzo and her boyfriend Dominic Roque recently went camping at Sierra Grove in Tanay, Rizal.  On Bea's YouTube vlog, the Kapuso actress said that's how they spent their Valentine's Day together.  The couple set up their tent and prepared their meals as they enjoyed communing with nature in the mountains of Rizal.  Bea also shared several tips for a better camping experience.  1. Pack blankets to keep you warm.  At their camping site, Bea said it would get really windy and chilly.  She advised, "When you come here, be sure to bring your own sleeping bags or comforters—anything that would warm you up—or jowa. Charot!"  2. Bring a water heater.  While they brought a makeshift shower, Bea said that she was shaking from the cold.  To remedy this for their next trip, they plan to bring a portable water heater and a foldable bucket. A bigger kettle is also an option to heat some bath water.  3. Stay for more than one night.  According to Bea, Dom said an overnight trip is "bitin" for a camping trip, as they still had to set up their tent and their gear first before they could really relax.  "Enjoyable naman siya na parang kayong  dalawa lang sa mundo," Bea said.  To make the most out of the experience, Bea said staying for more than one night is a good idea for next camping trips.  Bea and Dom have been sharing their adventures together after confirming their relationship in August 2021.  More recently, Dom surprised Bea with a random bouquet of tulips for International Women's Day.  Bea is set to star on the GMA Network-Viu Philippines series, "Love Before Sunrise," with Dennis Trillo.  —Kimberly Tsao/MGP, GMA Integrated News
