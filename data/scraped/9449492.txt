 Watch The Modern People Leader's recent episode with Nadia Vatalidis (she/her/hers), the Head of People & Culture at TestGorilla. She shared tips for improving asynchronous work, how to operationalize your values, and the type of CEO that she likes to work for. Don't have time to watch to the whole thing? Read the highlights below. ⬇️ "With assumptions comes backchanneling. The moment someone is assuming something, they're going to tell someone else. That's going to plant a seed that creates bias." Nadia says that your values need to be interwoven into the day-to-day work. Whether that's an emoji that you create or being able to physically touch it at an offsite, your values need to be tangible. Without intentional efforts in a distributed environment, your culture will change organically, and likely not in the direction that you desire. Look for co-founders and CEOs who have great lives outside of work. That's typically an indicator that they give their people the ability to integrate their work into their lives, and not the other way around. Nadia says every company should do these two things. 1️⃣ Develop a guide that demonstrates how and when to use different communication methods and tools (e.g., email, slack, in-person meeting, virtual meeting, etc). This can help prevent the over-scheduling of meetings. 2️⃣ Define and communicate the company’s preferred style of communication, be it direct or indirect. Make it clear that certain styles, like short and direct responses, are not considered rude but are in fact efficient and clear. Because different cultures have different communication norms and practices, it’s important to set guidelines that everyone understands and respects to prevent misunderstandings. “Someone that deeply cares about designing experiences for people. It's not just about the policies they need to create. It's not about a checklist. It's actually about designing that amazing experience and knowing they're going to impact someone's life probably for quite a short amount of time. But that impact is going to last. And that's so important.” "I think being a perfectionist is completely overrated. I think it's better to ship fast. I'm not saying to completely break things, but get something live and then make it better." Go listen to the full episode: Apple | Spotify | YouTube  See you next week!
