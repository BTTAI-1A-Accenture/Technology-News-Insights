By Cort Reynolds The Bluffton High School football team seeks to stay undefeated atop the Northwest Conference when they invade War Memorial Stadium for their last league battle at Ada Friday night, September 22. The Bulldogs are joining the Blanchard Valley Conference next season after being a NWC member since 1963.  Ada (2-3, 0-2 NWC) has lost two in a row, including a 55-24 defeat to undefeated Leipsic last Friday in a game that they trailed just 28-24 in the third period. The potent Pirates improved to 5-0 overall and 2-0 in the NWC with a 56-0 blowout win over Spencerville last Friday.  The Pirates have outscored their opponents 231-28 this season. Bluffton leads the NWC in points scored per game (46.2), and is also first in least points allowed per contest (5.4.). The Pirates have shut out their last three opponents after beating Pandora-Gilboa 28-21 in week two, their only close game this season thus far. The Bulldogs have been outscored by their foes, 190-125. Ada is 1-1 at home this season, while Bluffton is 2-0 on the road. “Bluffton is extremely talented and fast,” said Ada head coach Toby Smith. “We have to focus this week on our fundamentals if we want to get some stops on defense. “They are very aggressive on defense so we will have to keep our heads up so we can pick up their stunts and aggressive backers,” he added. The two rivals feature the top three rushers in the NWC. Pirate Landen Worcester has rushed for a league-leading 632 yards with 10 touchdowns so far this season. He ran for 171 yards and three TDs last Friday. Ada senior back Jalee Bolden has netted 582 yards on 87 runs (6.7 avg. per carry) with nine touchdowns. Ada junior quarterback Levi Green has rushed for 537 yards and six TDs on 91 carries (5.9 avg.). He has completed 35 of 70 passes for 449 yards. Efficient Pirate QB Garret Bogart has completed 22 of 32 aerials for 470 yards and eight TDs with no interceptions. Ada junior wideout Kaine Fisher leads the NWC in receptions with 24 catches for 297 yards this year. Pirate receiver Braeden Jordan tops the league in yards per catch (29.0) and has made four TD grabs. Bluffton’s Gavin Bogart is a dual receiving and running threat, and has scored eight TDs this season. He ran for 72 yards and two scores last week. Ada lost at Bluffton 31-7 last year, but the game was more competitive than the final score indicates.  The Bulldogs hung close through the first half, but a big-play Bluffton offense and a Pirate goal line stand as time expired in the second period swung momentum their way. Bluffton is ranked second in the Div. VI, Region 22 ratings. In the Div. VII, Region 26 computer rankings, Ada is tied with Hardin Northern and Delphos Jefferson at 17th.  Leipsic climbed to fourth place in region 26 after their win at the Bulldogs.  Bluffton, Leipsic, Crestview and Columbus Grove are in a four-way tie for first in the NWC at 2-0. The other four league teams are all 0-2. Dangerous Ada has lost their last two games by a combined score of 102-33 to foes who are a combined 9-1. Crestview (4-1) beat the visiting Bulldogs 47-9 in the NWC opener. Ada’s overall opposition has authored a 17-8 record this season, including 14-6 in games not against the Bulldogs. Bluffton’s opponents are a combined 9-16 (9-11 in non-Pirate games). Kick-off is set for 7 p.m. Friday with warm, dry weather in the forecast. Bluffton Icon Media LLCP.O.
