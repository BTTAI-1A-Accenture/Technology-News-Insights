Beauty Hello, depth and dimension. With September in full swing (and New York Fashion Week officially underway), cozy amber perfumes and on-trend ‘fits so associated with the fall season are creeping their way into the forefront. (Alongside yummy pumpkin spice lattes, of course.) While summertime glam is defined by a distinctive “less is more” mentality, prioritizing glowing complexions and faux freckles over more full-coverage looks, the cooler fall and winter seasons generally allow for a little bit more creativity. As for this upcoming season’s makeup trends to watch? For one, matte lipsticks that defined 2016 are making a serious comeback, with new lip-loving formulas that aim to nix unwanted dry lips. What’s more, both “latte makeup” and “cinnamon spice girl makeup” are being spotted on A-listers like Hailey Bieber and Madelyn Cline, with earthy, bronzed hues and monochromatic terracotta pigments a perfect complement to the autumn season, respectively. No matter what glam looks you’re going for in the coming months, there’s nothing like a stunning (and surprisingly versatile) nude eyeshadow palette to amp up your eyes’ depth and dimension. If you so happen to be on the market for a tried-and-true palette that is beloved by many, or perhaps a newer buzz-worthy launch that just hit the market — here are 16 nude eyeshadow palettes for fall 2023 that are filled with neutral pigments.
