Milind Thatte, Managing Director, Procter & Gamble Health Limited, said, “Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism reveals that nearly 47 per cent of the Indian population suffers from Vitamin B12 deficiency[1]. With our flagship brand Polybion at the forefront, we at P&G Health are actively working towards creating heightened awareness around Vitamin B deficiencies. Through the ‘Polybion Pragati Utsav’ we aim to lead conversations on the importance of Vitamin B consumption to build a stronger immunity. Starting with the HCPs in Bihar and Rajasthan, we plan to impart education on the importance of monitoring the patient’s complete blood count (CBC), peripheral smear and Serum B12.”



Vijay Pampana, Marketing Director, added, “Vitamin B deficiencies can lead to low or reduced body energy levels, brain function, cell metabolism and immune functions, resulting in weakness, anaemia, viral and bacterial infections and such other health problems. But these symptoms are often ignored, making early identification and seeking timely diagnosis the need of the hour. This is the challenge we seek to address through the ‘Polybion Pragati Utsav’, by helping empower the doctor community to help address Vitamin B deficiencies more effectively”.

As an ongoing effort, P&G Health is constantly engaging with patients, consumers and Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) to help educate and raise awareness around Vitamin B deficiencies. P&G Health also contributes to scientific learning and knowledge exchange forums for medical practitioners, including diagnostic workshops, continuing medical education, case-based discussions and global discussion forums.
