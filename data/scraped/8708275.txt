First
Care Clinic is excited to report that the construction on the corner of 13th
and Main, the site of their new Express Care Clinic and Pharmacy, remains
on schedule.  The project is expected to be completed next month.  Dr.
Christine Fisher, the Medical Director at First Care Clinic, has been leading
the efforts to assemble a staff that will provide acute medical care.  “Our
goal in Express Care is to give patients high quality, same-day health care
that works best in their schedule. We have exceptional providers who are ready
to meet patient needs.” Fisher said. Cammi
Williby and Tiffany DeWitt will anchor the Express Care team.   These two
providers have extensive acute care experience and are passionate about
providing their patients a high level of care.  Both providers are already
seeing patients at the 105 W. 13th St. location Monday through Friday
from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Saturdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. “When
construction is completed on the corner, Express Care won’t miss a beat," said Eric Flax, CEO of First Care Clinic. " They will be seeing patients at their permanent location.  The pharmacy
will open shortly after with an anticipated date of late summer.”  “We have surveyed our patients, visited with members of our
community and toured other clinics in Kansas to come up with what we feel is a
very good model," he continued.  "We know people are busy, and their time is
important.  By providing a self-scheduling option, you can pick your
appointment time and skip the line.”  They offer same-day and next-day availability at Express Care, he said. To schedule an
