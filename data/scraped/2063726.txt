South Fork High athletic director Ed Geiger told Treasure Coast newspapers, FLORIDA TODAY's news partner, on Tuesday he accepted a forfeit from Viera High football for the game that was to be played Friday in Stuart. A Brevard Public Schools representative said he could not confirm the decision. Varsity and junior varsity team activities were suspended and head coach Shane Staples was relieved of his duties, both until further notice, in a Sunday announcement from BPS following the revelation of a video depicting what was described as "hazing" in a BPS release. Geiger was unable to find a replacement on short notice for South Fork's Week 1 game, and he expressed disappointment for Viera players and fans. "The people I feel the worst for are all of the Viera kids, parents and the community, the student-athletes that weren't involved with this, I feel terrible for them," Geiger said. "We tried, myself, coach (Antwan) Blatch, we all worked to try to find a game (for us), but it just didn't happen, just too short a notice. (Accepting the forfeit) was the decision we had to do to protect our own interests. Ultimately we wanted to be on the field." Brevard superintendent:Viera football players return to practice Wednesday following hazing incident A tweet on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, from the South Fork Athletics account reads that "due to circumstances beyond our control, the varsity football game on Friday night has been cancelled." Geiger also said Viera will make up the amount South Fork would have earned in ticket sales. Viera has a Week 2 game scheduled at Satellite, followed by its Sept. 8 home opener against Rockledge. The Hawks were 0-10 last season, the first under Staples, but the team won its spring game at Bayside in May and then outscored two opponents by a combined 68 points over four quarters — two each against Seabreeze and Merritt Island — this past Friday in a jamboree at New Smyrna Beach.
