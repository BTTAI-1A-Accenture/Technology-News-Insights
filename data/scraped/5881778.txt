COLUMBUS, Ohio — A group of Ohio lawmakers have introduced a bill that would toughen the state’s laws on corruption. Senate Bill 133 would expand the definition of corruption to include a wider range of activities, and it would increase the penalties for those who are convicted of corruption offenses. The bill was introduced in the wake of the sentencing of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder, who was convicted in what has been called Ohio’s largest corruption scandal. The bill would create a new category of offenses called “public corruption by a vendor.” This category would include offenses such as bribing a public official, colluding with other vendors to restrain competition, and submitting false or misleading information in connection with a public contract. Supporters of the bill say that it is necessary to crack down on corruption in Ohio. Opponents of the bill say that it is too broad and that it could criminalize legitimate business practices. They also argue that the bill would make it more difficult for businesses to compete for state contracts. The bill is likely to be a controversial one, and it is unclear whether it will be passed by the Ohio legislature.
