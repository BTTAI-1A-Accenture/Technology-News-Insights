Reviewed Updated: Jul 1, 2024, 3:22pm There are a few stocks with a price per share that has risen into the four digits. These stocks look very expensive, and for certain investors, a high share price could potentially be a symbol of a company’s success. Some high-priced stocks have been outstanding performers over recent years. However, the dollar price of a stock doesn’t tell you much about a company’s underlying value. That’s because a high share price has more to do with a company’s ownership structure than its business fundamentals. Expensive shares might even deter investors who feel there’s limited upside for a stock. In addition, smaller investors may not be able to afford a single share of a highly-priced stock. In this list, Forbes Advisor rounds up the 10 public companies that have the most expensive share prices on major U.S. stock exchanges.

 MicroStrategy is a software solutions company that operates online through an app, online sales or the cloud. To help companies scale up and achieve their visions, MicroStrategy harnesses artificial intelligence, otherwise known as AI. Part of MSTR’s most recent appeal, however, is that it is also a bitcoin development company that contributes to the network and accumulates bitcoin. As crypto has been catapulted into a new bull market this year, MSTR has reaped the benefits.  Stock Price  $1,737

 NVR is one of the largest U.S. homebuilders, primarily focusing on single-family detached home construction. The company also has a mortgage and title insurance business. The Federal Reserve’s emergency interest rate cuts in 2020 triggered a boom in the U.S. housing market, but the Fed has now been raising interest rates for the past year to combat inflation. As a result, mortgage rates have spiked and the housing market has cooled, weighing on NVR’s orders and growth outlook.  Stock Price  $610,868

 Berkshire Hathaway is billionaire value investing legend Warren Buffett’s multinational conglomerate holding company. Berkshire has a massive public and private investment portfolio that includes stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC) and Chevron (CVX). Berkshire’s Class B shares are reasonably priced at just $308 per share, but its Class A stock price is approaching half a million dollars per share. Buffett has said he will never split Berkshire’s Class A stock because he believes the high stock price ensures Berkshire has a sophisticated voting shareholder base with a long-term investing mindset.  *All data is sourced from StockRover, current as of May 30, 2024. One of the biggest misconceptions among inexperienced investors is that a high share price indicates a stock is overvalued. In reality, what matters is a company’s underlying value, which is more accurately represented by its market capitalization. Market cap is calculated by multiplying a company’s stock price by its total number of outstanding shares. Different companies have widely different share structures, even if they have similar market caps. For example, Bank of America and Eli Lilly have similar market caps of around $300 billion—but Bank of America has more than 8.1 billion outstanding shares while Eli Lilly has only 950 million.

 The age-old adage that price is what you pay and value is what you get certainly applies to the stock market as well. Daniel Milan, managing partner and investment advisor representative at Cornerstone Financial Services, says investors looking for value in the market should ignore a stock’s share price and focus on its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) or other fundamental valuation metrics. “The value that should matter to an investor is the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) or even more importantly, the forward P/E,” Milan says. “A low P/E ratio is a better gauge for an investor to determine if they are receiving an attractive amount of value for what they are purchasing.” The list of most expensive stocks in the market mostly represents successful companies that have chosen not to implement stock splits. A stock split increases a company’s total number of shares outstanding by a specific multiple and decreases its share price by that same multiple. For example, a company with 1 million shares of stock worth $1,000 each may choose to implement a 2-for-1 split that would double its share count to 2 million and decrease its share price to $500. It’s important for investors to understand that stock splits don’t inherently create any value for investors. In the case of the hypothetical stock split described above, the company’s market cap would be $1 billion both before and after the stock split. The only difference between stocks with expensive share prices and stocks with affordable share prices is their share structure. A stock with a high share price is generally just as likely to have long-term upside potential as a stock with a low share price. Dr. Robert Johnson, a chartered financial analyst (CFA) and professor of finance at Creighton University, says a company’s stock price should essentially be irrelevant to investors. “What investors should be interested in is what ownership the share entitles them to. That is, as a shareholder, how much of the firm and the firm’s earning power do I own,” Johnson says. This ownership is represented not by a stock’s share price but rather by its fundamental valuation metrics, such as P/E, price-to-sales and price-to-free cash flow ratios.
