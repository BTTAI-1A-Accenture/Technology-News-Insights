Here are two examples of actual operations that made the choice to use ServiceTitan, and how it wound up helping them reach the next level, thanks to its innovative integrations. “Before purchasing the TomTom Telematics system, integrated with ServiceTitan, we were just guessing where our guys were at any given time,” says Todd Kiefer, Tiger Services’ General Manager. “We wanted to give our office staff and the techs a tool that would help respond to customers who said we did not show up, or were late in arriving.” Operating out of the St. Louis metropolitan area, Tiger Plumbing, Heating, Air Conditioning and Electrical Services manages 28 vehicles and technicians across 160 square miles of service area. Adding the TomTom Telematics system, integrated with ServiceTitan, allowed the operation to see on-the-go technicians’ locations in real time. The change allowed Tiger Services’ dispatchers to start assigning their closest tech to a new job, and to dispatch jobs without endless SMS texts or calls. The technicians are happier, too, as a two-way communication features lets them respond easily from their vehicles while staying hands-free. “I’d recommend TomTom Telematics and ServiceTitan to anyone,” says Kiefer. “We saw our investments pay off right away. Not only has it lead to more jobs every day – but more revenue overall for our business.” “As long as we’re able to use the ServiceTitan Integration into Yelp, it’s a serious advantage,” says Josh Campbell, owner of Rescue Air Heating & Cooling. “[The integration] is just one more thing that makes us look more professional and differentiates us as a bigger, stronger company. It lets our customers know that we’re working to build a better client experience.” Business review site Yelp can have a huge impact on how many potential clients become actual clients. At Rescue Air Heating & Cooling, Josh chose to partner with ServiceTitan to harness all that online activity and turn it into extra revenue by offering Yelp users a quick and easy way to schedule service through the company. The integration in question lets customers click a simple “Book Online” button from on a business’ Yelp page, fill out a few quick details like type of service needed, the exact issue, the address, and a date and time. Within 15 minutes, the customer has set an appointment, and the business can view their new client through the ServiceTitan software interface. Three months after adapting the ServiceTitan Yelp integration, Rescue Air had increased their bookings by $50,000 — all from Yelp Integration bookings.
