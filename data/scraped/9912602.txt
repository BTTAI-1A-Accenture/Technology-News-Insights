Fewer incident reports as cybercrime spoils
riseCert NZ, the government’s Computer
Emergency Response Team, says the number of reported online
crime incidents in the last year was lower than last year.
The organisation received 8,160 incident reports. That’s
down eight per cent from 2021.Yet while reports
were down, reported financial losses leapt 19 per cent to
$20 million. That’s the largest amount reported to Cert NZ
in a single year. The fall in the total number of
reports was due to plummeting reports of malware incidents.
These were down 88 per cent during the last year.
Meanwhile the numbers of phishing and credential
harvesting incidents, scams and fraud; and unauthorised
access were all up. Take malware out of the
picture and the number of reported incidents was up 15 per
cent year on year. There were 2,300 reports of
scams and fraud in 2022. These cost New Zealanders more than
$17 million. Rob Pope, Cert NZ’s director says:
"…there were no large-scale campaigns targeting New
Zealanders – such as the Flubot malware – in 2022.
However, we did see smaller campaigns, such as unauthorised
money transfer scams, that targeted individuals for large
losses.” Ransomware reports were at an all time
high. Cert NZ says some of these were linked incidents where
a single attack had a flow on to other organisations.
It’s worth pointing out that Cert NZ’s
numbers are for reported cybercrime incidents. Not all
crimes are reported. Indeed, not all cybercrimes are
detected by the victims. 



Kordia:
Cyber-attacks hit over half of surveyed
businessesKordia published its latest cybercrime
research this week and says 55 per cent of NZ businesses
surveyed were subject to a cyber-attack. Phishing
remains the most common attack. Kordia says it accounted for
37 per cent of attacks on businesses over the last year.
The company says close to one business in four saw
commercially sensitive data or intellectual property
accessed or stolen.Older readers will know Kordia
as the state-owned enterprise that span out of TVNZ to
manage the national broadcast TV network. These days it
offers technology services to businesses and specialises in
cyber security.Telecoms complaints back
to normal levels, same old issuesClose to 2000
complaints were made to the Telecommunications Dispute
Resolution service in the second half of 2022. That’s
about the same as the number of complaints during the whole
of 2021. The TDR says that was a quieter year than
usual because of the efforts made by the industry to support
customers through the lockdowns. "Since then, our volumes
are returning to normal in part due to the resumption of
billing collections by phone and internet providers, but
also due to the increased awareness efforts by TDR.
Customers’ frustrations with the
telecommunications industry haven’t changed. The same
issues are behind the complaints, in much the same order as
before. Billing complaints are up five percent while service
complaints are down 3.6 per cent. The TDR says
almost 97 per cent of issues are resolved during the first
step of its process. “Of the 1,492 complaints that were
resolved or closed during this period, three were settled by
facilitation, 18 were resolved by mediated agreement and 29
required TDR’s adjudicators to make a
decision.”The New Zealand
Telecommunications Forum says it will soon begin consulting
on updating the TDR’s constitution, terms of reference and
customer care code.Vodafone TV
to close on March 31It hung on for far longer
than expected, but Vodafone TV will serve up its last video
stream late on March 31. Vodafone first announced
it would close Vodafone TV in December 2021. The plan was to
move customers to either a Sky TV satellite set-top box or a
streaming box: the Sky Box or Sky Pod. Yet the pandemic,
supply chain disruption and other unforeseen events meant
these products took far longer than expected to reach the
market. In recent weeks Vodafone NZ has called
customers who have yet to switch, encouraging them to place
an order with Sky. It’s likely many of them will simply
switch to other streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon
Prime. Vodafone is asking customers to return
their old set top boxes so they can be recycled. Watercare uses Spark narrow-band IoT for
loggersAuckland’s Watercare is rolling out IoT
water meter loggers for commercial premises. The project
aims to improve water management, save costs on manual
reading and improve bill accuracy for commercial customers.
The water services company says the project has
already helped identify a number of large leaks. This
includes one at a school where the daily water use went from
6000 to 70,000 litres a day with no obvious signs of
leakage. Sepull takes Sky CTO
roleSky has hired former Air New Zealand chief
digital officer Jennifer Sepal as its chief technology
officer. She previously worked as CIO for USAA Financial
Services, Kimberly-Clark and Honda Motor Corporation. She
has also had senior advisory roles at IBM Global Consulting
Services.Sophie Moloney, Sky’s chief executive
said Sepull will lead the work for the company as it looks
to it’s next phase of technology transformation which will
include ad-tech.When the going gets
tough, people buy fancy phonesCounterpoint
Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint
says the trends apply around the world, not only in the
wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per
cent market share. The remainder of the market is Huawei’s
Harmony OS. IDC: Wearable device market
poised for reboundResearch company IDC says the
market for wearable devices will bounce back in 2023 after
contracting in 2022. It forecasts 442.7 million devices will
ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.
Once that clears, IDC expects the market to grow
by an average of 5.4 per cent until 2027. In other news…Netflix says it plans to
release 40 games this year and another 70 are in
development. The company entered the games market in 2021
and offers 55 games today. Games are included as part of
Netflix membership. They can be downloaded and played on
phones and tablets. While today’s focus is on mobile
games, Netflix is working on delivering them from the cloud.

Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with

another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone

 The fall in the total number of
reports was due to plummeting reports of malware incidents.
These were down 88 per cent during the last year.
 Meanwhile the numbers of phishing and credential
harvesting incidents, scams and fraud; and unauthorised
access were all up. Take malware out of the
picture and the number of reported incidents was up 15 per
cent year on year. There were 2,300 reports of
scams and fraud in 2022. These cost New Zealanders more than
$17 million. Rob Pope, Cert NZ’s director says:
"…there were no large-scale campaigns targeting New
Zealanders – such as the Flubot malware – in 2022.
However, we did see smaller campaigns, such as unauthorised
money transfer scams, that targeted individuals for large
losses.” Ransomware reports were at an all time
high. Cert NZ says some of these were linked incidents where
a single attack had a flow on to other organisations.
It’s worth pointing out that Cert NZ’s
numbers are for reported cybercrime incidents. Not all
crimes are reported. Indeed, not all cybercrimes are
detected by the victims. 



Kordia:
Cyber-attacks hit over half of surveyed
businessesKordia published its latest cybercrime
research this week and says 55 per cent of NZ businesses
surveyed were subject to a cyber-attack. Phishing
remains the most common attack. Kordia says it accounted for
37 per cent of attacks on businesses over the last year.
The company says close to one business in four saw
commercially sensitive data or intellectual property
accessed or stolen.Older readers will know Kordia
as the state-owned enterprise that span out of TVNZ to
manage the national broadcast TV network. These days it
offers technology services to businesses and specialises in
cyber security.Telecoms complaints back
to normal levels, same old issuesClose to 2000
complaints were made to the Telecommunications Dispute
Resolution service in the second half of 2022. That’s
about the same as the number of complaints during the whole
of 2021. The TDR says that was a quieter year than
usual because of the efforts made by the industry to support
customers through the lockdowns. "Since then, our volumes
are returning to normal in part due to the resumption of
billing collections by phone and internet providers, but
also due to the increased awareness efforts by TDR.
Customers’ frustrations with the
telecommunications industry haven’t changed. The same
issues are behind the complaints, in much the same order as
before. Billing complaints are up five percent while service
complaints are down 3.6 per cent. The TDR says
almost 97 per cent of issues are resolved during the first
step of its process. “Of the 1,492 complaints that were
resolved or closed during this period, three were settled by
facilitation, 18 were resolved by mediated agreement and 29
required TDR’s adjudicators to make a
decision.”The New Zealand
Telecommunications Forum says it will soon begin consulting
on updating the TDR’s constitution, terms of reference and
customer care code.Vodafone TV

stream late on March 31. Vodafone first announced
it would close Vodafone TV in December 2021. The plan was to

 There were 2,300 reports of
scams and fraud in 2022. These cost New Zealanders more than
$17 million.  Rob Pope, Cert NZ’s director says:
"…there were no large-scale campaigns targeting New
Zealanders – such as the Flubot malware – in 2022.
However, we did see smaller campaigns, such as unauthorised
money transfer scams, that targeted individuals for large
losses.” Ransomware reports were at an all time
high. Cert NZ says some of these were linked incidents where
a single attack had a flow on to other organisations.
It’s worth pointing out that Cert NZ’s
numbers are for reported cybercrime incidents. Not all
crimes are reported. Indeed, not all cybercrimes are
detected by the victims. 



Kordia:
Cyber-attacks hit over half of surveyed
businessesKordia published its latest cybercrime
research this week and says 55 per cent of NZ businesses
surveyed were subject to a cyber-attack. Phishing
remains the most common attack. Kordia says it accounted for
37 per cent of attacks on businesses over the last year.
The company says close to one business in four saw
commercially sensitive data or intellectual property
accessed or stolen.Older readers will know Kordia
as the state-owned enterprise that span out of TVNZ to
manage the national broadcast TV network. These days it
offers technology services to businesses and specialises in
cyber security.Telecoms complaints back
to normal levels, same old issuesClose to 2000
complaints were made to the Telecommunications Dispute
Resolution service in the second half of 2022. That’s
about the same as the number of complaints during the whole
of 2021. The TDR says that was a quieter year than
usual because of the efforts made by the industry to support
customers through the lockdowns. "Since then, our volumes
are returning to normal in part due to the resumption of
billing collections by phone and internet providers, but
also due to the increased awareness efforts by TDR.
Customers’ frustrations with the
telecommunications industry haven’t changed. The same
issues are behind the complaints, in much the same order as
before. Billing complaints are up five percent while service
complaints are down 3.6 per cent. The TDR says
almost 97 per cent of issues are resolved during the first
step of its process. “Of the 1,492 complaints that were
resolved or closed during this period, three were settled by
facilitation, 18 were resolved by mediated agreement and 29
required TDR’s adjudicators to make a
decision.”The New Zealand
Telecommunications Forum says it will soon begin consulting
on updating the TDR’s constitution, terms of reference and
customer care code.Vodafone TV
to close on March 31It hung on for far longer
than expected, but Vodafone TV will serve up its last video
stream late on March 31. Vodafone first announced
it would close Vodafone TV in December 2021. The plan was to
move customers to either a Sky TV satellite set-top box or a
streaming box: the Sky Box or Sky Pod. Yet the pandemic,
supply chain disruption and other unforeseen events meant
these products took far longer than expected to reach the
market. In recent weeks Vodafone NZ has called
customers who have yet to switch, encouraging them to place
an order with Sky. It’s likely many of them will simply
switch to other streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon
Prime. Vodafone is asking customers to return
their old set top boxes so they can be recycled. Watercare uses Spark narrow-band IoT for
loggersAuckland’s Watercare is rolling out IoT
water meter loggers for commercial premises. The project
aims to improve water management, save costs on manual
reading and improve bill accuracy for commercial customers.
The water services company says the project has
already helped identify a number of large leaks. This
includes one at a school where the daily water use went from
6000 to 70,000 litres a day with no obvious signs of
leakage. Sepull takes Sky CTO
roleSky has hired former Air New Zealand chief
digital officer Jennifer Sepal as its chief technology
officer. She previously worked as CIO for USAA Financial
Services, Kimberly-Clark and Honda Motor Corporation. She
has also had senior advisory roles at IBM Global Consulting
Services.Sophie Moloney, Sky’s chief executive
said Sepull will lead the work for the company as it looks
to it’s next phase of technology transformation which will
include ad-tech.When the going gets
tough, people buy fancy phonesCounterpoint
Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint
says the trends apply around the world, not only in the
wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per
cent market share. The remainder of the market is Huawei’s
Harmony OS. IDC: Wearable device market
poised for reboundResearch company IDC says the
market for wearable devices will bounce back in 2023 after
contracting in 2022. It forecasts 442.7 million devices will
ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.
Once that clears, IDC expects the market to grow
by an average of 5.4 per cent until 2027. In other news…Netflix says it plans to
release 40 games this year and another 70 are in
development. The company entered the games market in 2021
and offers 55 games today. Games are included as part of
Netflix membership. They can be downloaded and played on
phones and tablets. While today’s focus is on mobile
games, Netflix is working on delivering them from the cloud.

 Kordia published its latest cybercrime
research this week and says 55 per cent of NZ businesses
surveyed were subject to a cyber-attack. Phishing
remains the most common attack. Kordia says it accounted for
37 per cent of attacks on businesses over the last year.
The company says close to one business in four saw
commercially sensitive data or intellectual property
accessed or stolen.Older readers will know Kordia
as the state-owned enterprise that span out of TVNZ to
manage the national broadcast TV network. These days it
offers technology services to businesses and specialises in
cyber security.Telecoms complaints back
to normal levels, same old issuesClose to 2000
complaints were made to the Telecommunications Dispute
Resolution service in the second half of 2022. That’s
about the same as the number of complaints during the whole
of 2021. The TDR says that was a quieter year than
usual because of the efforts made by the industry to support
customers through the lockdowns. "Since then, our volumes
are returning to normal in part due to the resumption of
billing collections by phone and internet providers, but
also due to the increased awareness efforts by TDR.
Customers’ frustrations with the
telecommunications industry haven’t changed. The same
issues are behind the complaints, in much the same order as
before. Billing complaints are up five percent while service
complaints are down 3.6 per cent. The TDR says
almost 97 per cent of issues are resolved during the first
step of its process. “Of the 1,492 complaints that were
resolved or closed during this period, three were settled by
facilitation, 18 were resolved by mediated agreement and 29
required TDR’s adjudicators to make a
decision.”The New Zealand
Telecommunications Forum says it will soon begin consulting
on updating the TDR’s constitution, terms of reference and
customer care code.Vodafone TV
to close on March 31It hung on for far longer
than expected, but Vodafone TV will serve up its last video
stream late on March 31. Vodafone first announced
it would close Vodafone TV in December 2021. The plan was to
move customers to either a Sky TV satellite set-top box or a
streaming box: the Sky Box or Sky Pod. Yet the pandemic,
supply chain disruption and other unforeseen events meant
these products took far longer than expected to reach the
market. In recent weeks Vodafone NZ has called
customers who have yet to switch, encouraging them to place
an order with Sky. It’s likely many of them will simply
switch to other streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon
Prime. Vodafone is asking customers to return
their old set top boxes so they can be recycled. Watercare uses Spark narrow-band IoT for
loggersAuckland’s Watercare is rolling out IoT
water meter loggers for commercial premises. The project
aims to improve water management, save costs on manual
reading and improve bill accuracy for commercial customers.
The water services company says the project has
already helped identify a number of large leaks. This
includes one at a school where the daily water use went from
6000 to 70,000 litres a day with no obvious signs of
leakage. Sepull takes Sky CTO
roleSky has hired former Air New Zealand chief
digital officer Jennifer Sepal as its chief technology
officer. She previously worked as CIO for USAA Financial
Services, Kimberly-Clark and Honda Motor Corporation. She
has also had senior advisory roles at IBM Global Consulting
Services.Sophie Moloney, Sky’s chief executive
said Sepull will lead the work for the company as it looks
to it’s next phase of technology transformation which will
include ad-tech.When the going gets
tough, people buy fancy phonesCounterpoint
Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint
says the trends apply around the world, not only in the
wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per
cent market share. The remainder of the market is Huawei’s

 Older readers will know Kordia
as the state-owned enterprise that span out of TVNZ to
manage the national broadcast TV network. These days it
offers technology services to businesses and specialises in
cyber security. Telecoms complaints back
to normal levels, same old issuesClose to 2000
complaints were made to the Telecommunications Dispute
Resolution service in the second half of 2022. That’s
about the same as the number of complaints during the whole
of 2021. The TDR says that was a quieter year than
usual because of the efforts made by the industry to support
customers through the lockdowns. "Since then, our volumes
are returning to normal in part due to the resumption of
billing collections by phone and internet providers, but
also due to the increased awareness efforts by TDR.
Customers’ frustrations with the
telecommunications industry haven’t changed. The same
issues are behind the complaints, in much the same order as
before. Billing complaints are up five percent while service
complaints are down 3.6 per cent. The TDR says
almost 97 per cent of issues are resolved during the first
step of its process. “Of the 1,492 complaints that were
resolved or closed during this period, three were settled by
facilitation, 18 were resolved by mediated agreement and 29
required TDR’s adjudicators to make a
decision.”The New Zealand
Telecommunications Forum says it will soon begin consulting
on updating the TDR’s constitution, terms of reference and
customer care code.Vodafone TV
to close on March 31It hung on for far longer
than expected, but Vodafone TV will serve up its last video
stream late on March 31. Vodafone first announced
it would close Vodafone TV in December 2021. The plan was to
move customers to either a Sky TV satellite set-top box or a
streaming box: the Sky Box or Sky Pod. Yet the pandemic,
supply chain disruption and other unforeseen events meant
these products took far longer than expected to reach the
market. In recent weeks Vodafone NZ has called
customers who have yet to switch, encouraging them to place
an order with Sky. It’s likely many of them will simply
switch to other streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon
Prime. Vodafone is asking customers to return
their old set top boxes so they can be recycled. Watercare uses Spark narrow-band IoT for
loggersAuckland’s Watercare is rolling out IoT
water meter loggers for commercial premises. The project
aims to improve water management, save costs on manual
reading and improve bill accuracy for commercial customers.
The water services company says the project has
already helped identify a number of large leaks. This
includes one at a school where the daily water use went from
6000 to 70,000 litres a day with no obvious signs of
leakage. Sepull takes Sky CTO
roleSky has hired former Air New Zealand chief
digital officer Jennifer Sepal as its chief technology
officer. She previously worked as CIO for USAA Financial
Services, Kimberly-Clark and Honda Motor Corporation. She
has also had senior advisory roles at IBM Global Consulting
Services.Sophie Moloney, Sky’s chief executive
said Sepull will lead the work for the company as it looks
to it’s next phase of technology transformation which will
include ad-tech.When the going gets
tough, people buy fancy phonesCounterpoint
Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint
says the trends apply around the world, not only in the
wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per
cent market share. The remainder of the market is Huawei’s
Harmony OS. IDC: Wearable device market
poised for reboundResearch company IDC says the
market for wearable devices will bounce back in 2023 after
contracting in 2022. It forecasts 442.7 million devices will
ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.

it would close Vodafone TV in December 2021. The plan was to
move customers to either a Sky TV satellite set-top box or a

supply chain disruption and other unforeseen events meant
these products took far longer than expected to reach the

switch to other streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon

Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint

wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple

per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent

to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per

market for wearable devices will bounce back in 2023 after

ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.
Once that clears, IDC expects the market to grow

games, Netflix is working on delivering them from the cloud.

 Customers’ frustrations with the
telecommunications industry haven’t changed. The same
issues are behind the complaints, in much the same order as
before. Billing complaints are up five percent while service
complaints are down 3.6 per cent.  The TDR says
almost 97 per cent of issues are resolved during the first
step of its process. “Of the 1,492 complaints that were
resolved or closed during this period, three were settled by
facilitation, 18 were resolved by mediated agreement and 29

Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint

poised for reboundResearch company IDC says the
market for wearable devices will bounce back in 2023 after
contracting in 2022. It forecasts 442.7 million devices will
ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.

phones and tablets. While today’s focus is on mobile
games, Netflix is working on delivering them from the cloud.

 Auckland’s Watercare is rolling out IoT
water meter loggers for commercial premises. The project
aims to improve water management, save costs on manual
reading and improve bill accuracy for commercial customers.
The water services company says the project has
already helped identify a number of large leaks. This
includes one at a school where the daily water use went from
6000 to 70,000 litres a day with no obvious signs of
leakage. Sepull takes Sky CTO
roleSky has hired former Air New Zealand chief
digital officer Jennifer Sepal as its chief technology
officer. She previously worked as CIO for USAA Financial
Services, Kimberly-Clark and Honda Motor Corporation. She
has also had senior advisory roles at IBM Global Consulting
Services.Sophie Moloney, Sky’s chief executive
said Sepull will lead the work for the company as it looks
to it’s next phase of technology transformation which will
include ad-tech.When the going gets

Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint
says the trends apply around the world, not only in the
wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per

said Sepull will lead the work for the company as it looks
to it’s next phase of technology transformation which will
include ad-tech. When the going gets
tough, people buy fancy phonesCounterpoint
Research says tougher economic times meant phone sales fell
12 per cent in 2022. Yet, while the bottom fell
out of the broader phone market, it was a different story at
the high end. Premium phone (that’s handsets that sell for
more than around NZ$1000) sales were up one per cent during
the year. This means revenue from premium phone
sales now accounts for more than half of all revenue (55 per
cent). This is the first time the premium segment has
dominated in financial terms. In unit terms premium phones
account for one-in-five phones sold. The picture
is even brighter for the ultra-premium segment (that’s
phones that sell for around NZ$1800 and up). Counterpoint
says this was the fastest growing part of the market with
sales up 38 per cent year on year. Counterpoint
says the trends apply around the world, not only in the
wealthier regions.Apple winnerApple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per
cent market share. The remainder of the market is Huawei’s
Harmony OS. IDC: Wearable device market

market for wearable devices will bounce back in 2023 after
contracting in 2022. It forecasts 442.7 million devices will
ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.
Once that clears, IDC expects the market to grow

phones and tablets. While today’s focus is on mobile
games, Netflix is working on delivering them from the cloud.

contracting in 2022. It forecasts 442.7 million devices will
ship this year. That’s up 6.3 per cent on last year’s
shipments. The category includes headsets and
earbuds, smart watches, wristbands and smart glasses.
IDC says it expects the first quarter of the year
will see another year on year decline with the recovery
coming later in the year. At the moment there is
an excess inventory of devices clogging distribution and
sales channels. This is depressing shipments and, in the
short term, it means lower average selling prices.
Once that clears, IDC expects the market to grow
by an average of 5.4 per cent until 2027. In other news…Netflix says it plans to
release 40 games this year and another 70 are in
development. The company entered the games market in 2021
and offers 55 games today. Games are included as part of
Netflix membership. They can be downloaded and played on
phones and tablets. While today’s focus is on mobile
games, Netflix is working on delivering them from the cloud.

 Apple
was the biggest winner. Its premium phone sales were up six
per cent. Counterpoint says it would have done better but
for supply disruptions during the peak season. Apple was the
main beneficiary of Huawei’s decline in the Chinese
market. Samsung phone sales dropped five per cent
in 2022. The company makes more profit selling its screens
to Apple than it makes from its own phone sales.
iOS gaining on AndroidApple dominates
the premium phone market. The iOS operating system is on
three quarter of premium handsets. Counterpoint
says Apple earns the bulk of its growth as its existing
customers upgrade. It says: “The stickiness of the iOS
ecosystem with multiple devices and services is high. If an
iPhone user also owns an Apple Watch or Mac, the
individual’s next smartphone upgrade will likely be
another iPhone.”The research company says
Android’s loss of market share in the premium phone
segment is the reason Google entered the market with its
Pixel phones. It also says Android could regain its share
with the arrival of more folding phones. Apple’s
share of the wider phone market has climbed in the last year
but remains at 22 per cent compared with Android’s 76 per
cent market share. The remainder of the market is Huawei’s
Harmony OS. IDC: Wearable device market
