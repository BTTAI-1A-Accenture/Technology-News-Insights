or Remember me or Financial advisors Josh Perello and Jimmy Guidry say the onboarding support and resources from Ameriprise made their transition smooth and seamless  Financial advisors Josh Perello,AIF®and Jimmy Guidry recently joined the independent channel of Ameriprise Financial Inc. (NYSE: AMP) with nearly $150 million in client assets in Breaux Bridge, LA. Perello joins from Raymond James and Guidry from Edward Jones.   Perello and Guidry met in 2015 when they both worked at Edward Jones and stayed in touch after Perello left for Raymond James in 2017. In early 2023, Guidry started exploring options to move to a firm that provides more support and capabilities to serve his clients. He was impressed with everything offered by Ameriprise, and he called Perello to tell him about it.   “Shortly into that conversation, we both realized we were sitting on a golden opportunity to build an incredible practice together at Ameriprise,” said Guidry.   “Financial planning is very important to us, which aligns perfectly with the Ameriprise value proposition,” said Perello.   “Our clients already know and trust us, and now we can serve them even better as we help them achieve their most important goals for the future,” added Guidry.   The onboarding team at Ameriprise facilitated a smooth experience for Perello and Guidry. “The hands-on support and digital transition capabilities from Ameriprise are top-notch,” said Perello. “After only one month, I have moved nearly 90% of my clients – and their feedback on switching to Ameriprise has been overwhelmingly positive.”   Joining Perello and Guidry is office manager Cathy Taylor. The team is supported locally by Ameriprise franchise field vice president Mike Barker and regional vice president Tres Rouquette.
