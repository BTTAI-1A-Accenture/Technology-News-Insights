PITTSBURGH, April 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- "We wanted a different kind of game to play for group entertainment," said two inventors from Las Vegas, Nev., "so we invented the Money Game. It will take away boredom at any function." 



 The invention provides a fun and entertaining game that could be enjoyed by adults age 21 and older. It could be played at parties, get-togethers, or during leisure/quality family time and encourages social interaction and friendly competition among family and friends.
