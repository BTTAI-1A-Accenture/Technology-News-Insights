AI is proving to be a game-changer in many applications across various sectors. In the optical inspection niche, the incorporation of artificial intelligence is a hot topic these days, and this particular market is expected to grow significantly. In PCB and circuit board production, using an AOI machine is crucial as it helps detect defects and ensures quality control. The addition of AI to these machines leads to superior, more accurate, and faster automation. Read on to learn why AI-based AOI machines are in high demand these days, how to incorporate AI in AOI inspection, its benefits, and more. Why is AI Needed in AOI Machines? PCBs and electrical circuit boards are becoming more and more complex with time. Their complex production processes require careful inspection to identify and flag defects on time to ensure the final product is free from issues and satisfies the quality standards set by the industry. While AOI machines are quite sophisticated and beneficial when it comes to achieving this, they are far from perfect. Multiple visual inspections are typically performed at various stages of the PCB production process. The use of an AOI machine, while faster than manual industrial inspection, is still time-consuming and prone to errors. That’s why manufacturers nowadays use artificial intelligence to enhance the performance of these AOI inspection systems. When combined with an AOI machine, AI offers many unique advantages and makes the production process faster and more cost-effective while also ensuring better quality control. How to Incorporate AI in AOI and its Advantages AI-powered AOI inspection system offers many advantages. It automates decisions, identifies manufacturing defects, highlights product differences, and offers valuable data for enhanced quality control. To incorporate AI in an AOI machine, you need a combination of complementary software and hardware that is capable of performing visual inspection with great efficiency and accuracy. The good news is, many brands, e.g. Maker-ray, offer systems and solutions that contain everything that’s required to start benefiting from AI-powered automated optical inspection. New advances in artificial intelligence have raised the bar in AOI machine technology. It has three key advantages: AI-powered AOI systems make inspection simple, reliable, and traceable.
