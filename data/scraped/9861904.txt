(NYSE:UNFI) in its Q2 2023 investor letter: “United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE:UNFI) distributes natural and organic food. Whole Foods is a 20% customer but UNFI has done a reasonable job diversifying its product set and customer base, with a big boost from the acquisition of SuperValu in 2018. The share price suffered when the January 2023 earnings report revealed a sudden margin deterioration and the company took down guidance.20 The margin miss was partially due to extremely volatile food prices, partially due to high priced organic food items losing share and partially due execution mistakes at the company. The company is cheap on reduced earnings estimates and we are comfortable with our current position.”  United Natural Foods, Inc.
