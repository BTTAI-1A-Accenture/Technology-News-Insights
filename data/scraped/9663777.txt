         ASX 200 futures are trading 21 points lower, down -0.29% as of 8:20 am AEST. Oil prices have made an almost vertical move from July lows of US$67 to a now 10-month high of US$92. A combination of production cuts, increasing demand, and a steady slide in inventories in the US have all created the perfect storm for traders. The impact is already being felt with a range of companies handing down re-jigged earnings guidances. Let's start with the airlines: Jet fuel has risen by more than 50% since early May. Delta Air Lines And while you might be reading this and thinking "Hans, these are global companies, who cares?" – You might not want to say that so fast. A falling Australian dollar is not good news for motorists because it costs more to import the petrol from overseas. The Australian Institute of Petroleum reports that the national price of unleaded rose by 2.7 cents per litre to 204.4 cents last week, up 26% year-on-year which is the largest increase in 14 months. We've suddenly gone from price deflation at the beginning of the year to rapid inflation. Source: Commsec I also hope you like central banks because we have a boat load of them to get through this week. The Fed, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of England are all due to hand down rate decisions on Thursday (yes, we're not joking. All on one day). Here's the fast guide to what you need to know: If you count the Bank of Japan on Friday, that's technically four central banks this week. I'll refrain from putting the consensus prediction into print given what happened six weeks ago when they adjusted yield curve control in a massive market shock (and this writer dismissed the meeting as a non-event). And if you thought that wasn't enough, we should also get the Chinese interest rate decision on Wednesday. Remember, the cut from a month ago was less than expected and markets were very unimpressed. Finally, the RBA meeting minutes are out today at 11:30 am. The good news is that the RBA is likely to believe its hikes are working and that there won't be a need for further ones. In even better news, some of the forward-looking job market indicators suggest the RBA may actually get inflation down to below 3% without getting the unemployment rate sustainably above 4%. Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! (Oi! Oi! Oi!) I almost died at 11:09 pm last night after witnessing the US 2-Year Treasury yield spike to 424 bps to 5.49%. Multiple sources including TradingView, CNBC and Investing.com reported the spike. However, this turned out to be a glitch and not the correct print. Such a move would have likely caused US futures to nosedive at least 5% and push the 10-year yield to at least 4.5%.
