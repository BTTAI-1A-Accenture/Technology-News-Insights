South Carolina in top 10 of states most threatened by agricultural land loss "South Carolina is one of the top 10 states most threatened by agricultural land loss," according to Upstate Forever.   The nonprofit conservation group says that between 2001 and 2016, "11 million acres of agricultural land were lost in America. Unfortunately, South Carolina is not spared from this trend, and lost 280,700 acres of agricultural land during the same period. " Upstate Forever is offering a free "Rural Preservation Series" blog for all citizens, whether  in cities or in rural and agricultural areas, to become aware of the many ways they can get  involved in helping direct future growth.   They say that often the main problem is poor planning, and citizens can have a powerful influence on municipalities and county government's decisions about zoning ordinances and countless other approaches to protecting rural and agricultural spaces.  One of the options Allie Martinsen mentions in her first blog is "to encourage counties and municipalities to establish transfer of development rights (TDR) programs, which allows property owners to shift development rights from agricultural land to designated growth zones." She says that no matter where you live, you have a role to play in protecting and maintaining the rural character of the Upstate. To subscribe to the blog, click here.
