A Saturday-night wreck east of Cleveland claimed the life of one driver. The Georgia State Patrol reports troopers were called to the wreck on Ga. 115 near Shenandoah Drive, between Black Road and Ga. 255 South. In that wreck, a 2007 Hyundai Elantra sedan driven by 35-year-old Robert Maynor of Cleveland was traveling east on Ga. 115 when the driver of a Toyota Tacoma pickup truck failed to maintain his lane, crossed the centerline, and struck the sedan head-on, according to GSP. The driver of the Hyundai died at the scene. The driver of the truck was not hurt. The Georgia State Patrol Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team is assisting with the investigation. So far, GSP has not released the names of the other driver involved.
