Well before it blew up, the massive star shed its outer layers. Those gas and dust remnants are just now being slammed into by the powerful supernova blast. The blast wave is lighting up the debris from the star and weaving it into beautiful, complex shapes and patterns. The Veil Nebula is located at the end of one of Cygnus the Swan’s wings. While it is possible to view this nebula with binoculars from a very dark place, telescopes offer a far better chance to find this dim apparition. Go outside when the rain lets up, look up and let the dust from past supernovas rain down on you.  Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.
