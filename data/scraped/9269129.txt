 A large iceberg broke off from the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica on January 22 this year. It has already sailed about 150 kilometers to the southwest (as can be seen on the time-lapse). The ice giant received the index A81. The area of the iceberg reaches 1,550 square kilometers - it is almost the same as London (with an area of 1,572 km²). Satellite and aerial photographs show how massive this block of ice is, which looks like an endless sheet even from a height. But what we see is only part of the mass of the iceberg, most of which extends hundreds of meters deep. The iceberg broke away from the glacier decades after the first cracks appeared - eventually, a large crack called "Chasm-1" stretched across the entire ice shelf. Iceberg A81 has now joined other pieces of the iceberg floating in the Weddell Sea, as seen in satellite images. The Brunt Ice Shelf is one of the most closely monitored shelves on the planet, and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) station Halley is located there. So far, the area of the research station has not been affected by the chipping of the iceberg. A81 is already the second large iceberg that has broken off in this region in the last two years. And while the breaking off of an iceberg is a natural process, it can still wreak havoc on the environment. Another massive iceberg in this area of Antarctica is A76A. This huge piece of ice is part of the A76 iceberg, which began its "journey" after breaking off from the Filchner Ice Shelf in mid-May 2021. Heading north, the A76 split into three sections, the largest of which was named the A76A. Currently, it is the largest floating iceberg on the planet with an area of about 3200 km² (135*25 km), which is twice the size of "Greater London". Polar scientists expect A81, like previous icebergs, to follow the Antarctic Coastal Current around the Weddell Sea. Scientists will continue to track and monitor A81 as it drifts further north into the southern Atlantic basin. It's important to clarify that the calving of icebergs at the forward edge of an ice shelf is a natural behavior and not necessarily a result of climate change. Ice shelves maintain an equilibrium, and ejecting bergs is one way they balance the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from feeding glaciers on land. Scientists have not detected significant climate changes in the Brunt region, unlike on the Antarctic Peninsula on the other side of the Weddell Sea. Therefore, the natural process described above has not been significantly altered. Additionally, estimates suggest that the Brunt was at its biggest extent in at least 100 years before the calving occurred. At SuperVision Earth, we use satellite imagery to help mitigate the impact of climate change.
