			Trending:		 The Fire Arts Center Gallery in Arcata is exhibiting the ceramic sculptures of Emma MacLaren and Josh Roller through September. MacLaren, a member at Fire Arts, is a self-taught sculptor who is inspired by the beauty of the Pacific Northwest and the Lost Coast. She creates multi-dimensional sculptures using a variety of techniques, including painting, hand building, carving and wheel-thrown pieces. Roller, a student at Fire Arts, creates sculptures that resemble various imaginative life forms, perhaps from other worlds. His sculptures are inspired by sketches and characters created “within the intuitive dance”. Fire Arts, located at 520 South G St. in Arcata, across from the Arcata Marsh Interpretive Center, has been teaching ceramics and fused glass skills and providing studio space and kiln firing resources to the local community since 2000. Fire Arts is open every day and has a large selection of locally made ceramic and fused glass pieces for sale all year. Classes are held year-round and include day and evening classes for adults and children. For more information, call 707-826-1445 or go to www.fireartsarcata.com. … Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group
