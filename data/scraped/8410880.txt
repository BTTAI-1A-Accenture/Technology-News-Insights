 Miller works as Director of Digital Product Management. In this position, he leads the development of Quility’s digital product experiences for both clients and agents. His team delivers measurable results through product solutions that meet market needs and company goals, while also managing all aspects of the product life cycle. 1. What piece of advice do you try to live by? Dare to explore. The only life worth living is one where you constantly seek to challenge yourself. Exploring the world and the things around you invites challenge. 2. What is your favorite book or movie and why?  “The Wizard of Oz.” Growing up in a small town and moving away for opportunities, I always connected with Dorothy on dreams of more exciting places, but just like she says, “There is no place like home.” I also just love the rich colors of the sets and each song is a classic. 3. What fictional person would you love to spend a day with? The Doctor from “Doctor Who”—an alien time traveler who has 13 incarnations of themselves to date in the series. I imagine the doctor telling amazing stories while traveling all of time and space to save humanity! 4. What makes you laugh every single time? My wife. She has a knack for comedic timing and jokes. 5. Where in the world would you travel for the perfect meal? Having lived in Asia, I would have to say anywhere in Southeast Asia. The perfect meal is street food. You don’t always know what you’re getting, but that’s half the fun! Like Miller says, “The only life worth living is one where you constantly seek to challenge yourself.” Looking to level up? Check out our current corporate career opportunities!
